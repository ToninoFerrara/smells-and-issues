Adb backup is not working on Oreo. The created backup file does not contain useful data and is 47 bytes in size. As a quick workaround, I removed the line

This seems to fix the issue: I successfully created a backup and restored it; seems to contain all necessary data. Not sure if anything relevant got left behind in ShoppingBackupAgent.java.

openintents/shoppinglist,open,Sending a list doesn't include the note.,[],"Hi,

I really love the app, I mostly use it to organise a load of todo lists in a sortof kanban style way.

The integration with the notepad is really useful and I've used it heavily in a list I use to keep track of what I've been planting on my allotment (the item names are bed names + what is currently planted and the notes contain the history + observations). 

I've got a lot of really useful information in there that I'd like to at least back up and at some point in the future probably use for my own project to help link it together - so I need to be able to export it.  

Previously I was using the tags to store the information (which do get exported) but that became cumbersome - the editing was fiddly when there was a lot of text and the notepad is much better suited to it.

I'd be happy to have a go at implementing myself if you want to point me in the right direction.

How to reproduce:
1. Create a shopping list as below:

**2. Switch to Shopping mode (important!)**
3. Tap the (+) in the action bar and type ""A"" into search field
4. Tap on Aaa

5. In ""Edit item"", tap on Note
6. Tap Back, tap OK
7. Tap the (x) next to the search field in action bar twice

Result: list view now shows ""Pick items"" at the top, although it is in Shopping mode. (REMOVED_FROM_LIST items are not shown). See below.

How to reproduce: create a shopping list, click the bars menu top left, click shopping, click pick items, switch between both a couple of times. The list view transitions to selected mode but the radio button does not follow, i.e. stays on the wrong selection, not the one tapped.

When sorting words in German the letters ä, ö, ü and ß are sorted as if they where a, o, u and ss accordingly. Foreign latin letters with accents etc. are sorted as if they have no accents.
This makes finding existing entries in the list surprisingly hard, especially if the words begin with an umlaut.

As these rules are specific to the German language and other languages will sort these letters at other positions (Swedish, Finnish) I'll suggest to use some existing locale aware functions to implement this."

openintents/shoppinglist,closed,OI Shopping List/Convert CSV for Windows Phone development,[],"I have been using an Android 2.2 phone for a while.  But more recently, I have been using a Windows 8.1 phone.

The app I most use is the Android based OI Shopping List.  After a lot of searching around for alternative shopping list apps for the Windows phone, it transpired that the most appropriate shopping list app for my Windows phone was OI Shopping List: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/apps/oi-shopping-list/9nblggh0jq9z

However, there is one bit of ""functionality"" that allowed me to integrate data to OI Shopping List on my Android to my desktop PC: OI Convert CSV.  Its HandyShopper format is particularly 'data rich', which allows data such as shops and shop prices to be imported.  In contrast, the Windows phone version only imports/exports just a bare check list of items either to the One/SkyDrive or via e-mail.

I've been trying to find the repository that is most appropriate for the Windows Phone version of OI Shopping List.  However, I can't find it.  In particular, I can't find a repository for what could be the Windows Phone version of OI Convert CSV.  Does a repository exist for this even?

So if somebody could point me in the right direction for this, it would be appreciated.  Also, pointers to information on how to develop the Windows Phone version of OI Shopping List would be appreciated, especially using a Linux PC!

(Apologies if this is an inappropriate place to put this message.  If I have submitted this request for information in the wrong place, please show me where I should be posting such a query.)

I can't get it to come back up (""Unfortunately OI Shopping List has stopped""), even if I restart the phone, clear the cache, etc.  My only way back is to uninstall the app, restart the phone, reinstall the app, and import the backup of my lists.  This problem happened several times on my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD, and now it is also doing it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  I would go to another app, but this one (when it works) is practically perfect.  I have it working again, and thought maybe if I add Stores under the Stores button instead of under Tags, I could sort it that way.  But I can't find a way to enter a store.  If I click on Stores, it says ""There are no stores set for this list"".  But no method to add stores for a list is provided.  Even when you add or edit a list item, there is no field to add a Store list (which is why I tag the stores instead).  At least I can sort the entire list by Tags, then alphabetical, so it groups them, more or less.  I sure wish someone would come up with a fix for this!  Suggestions?

openintents/shoppinglist,closed,List in widget,[],"This comes in place of my previous pull request (https://github.com/openintents/shoppinglist/pull/9), which can be closed (sorry, I couldn't figure out how to do that).

Compared to the previous pull request I removed the 'clean list' button from the widget, and also refactored it, so that I now use Build.VERSION instead of the bools.xml.  I wrote in that previous pull-request that the android 2 version seemed broken (the next/prev buttons didn't work), but I think that problem was actually caused by something I did, for in this version they do work.

What is changed in this branch is:
- Check an item in the widget doesn't make it disappear immediately, but grays it out (this gives better feedback as to what happenend, and gives the possibility of an undo)
- For android honeycomb or higher, the widget now uses a ListView.  This looks better (in my opinion), especially if multi-line items are used, and makes the next/prev buttons unnecessary.
- Some small changes to the layout of the widget: the buttons are aligned to the top now, the default size is smaller, so that it can also be displayed on (very) small phones.

openintents/shoppinglist,closed,Always add received text as 'new' items,[],"Text that is received from another app will now always be added
as new 'want_to_buy' items in the shoppinglist.  That seems to me
to be the most logical expectation from sharing text with a shopping list
app.

This fixes the following problem:
If I mark some of the items but not others, and then ""clean list"",
and then share the same note again, the items seem to come back as
checked instead of unchecked. That seems like it would be a problem
for workflows involving a cookbook app.

openintents/shoppinglist,closed,Use ListView in widget (only enabled for android honeycomb or higher),[],"I thought it would be nice to have a listview in the widget.  It saves space (the buttons are not necessary anymore) and also multi-line items are displayed better.
Unfortunately it is only supported for android honeycomb or higher, so I kept the old widget for older versions.

The first commit in this pull request also adds some other functionality in the widget, see git-comments there

openintents/shoppinglist,closed,Support receiving shared plain text,[],"This will parse the shared text, and add an item for each line
in that text.

This works very well with (for example) the shopping-list feature
of the MyCookbook app.
I think this also fixes the feature request found here:

openintents/shoppinglist,open,Default settings for new items,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","A user wrote to support@openintents.org:

> I'd like to have default settings for new items.  For every item I add I have to do the following afterward (1) long-press on the item, (2) select Stores..., (3) check an item and (4) press OK, then (5) select the item, (6) select the Quantity field, (7) enter #, (8) select Tags, (9) enter text, (10) press OK.  I would love it if I could choose a default store, quantity and tag for all new items.  Over 99% of all new items I add will be Store=Grocery and Quantity=1.  About half of those will be Tag=Grocery.  I can change the Tag if it's not Grocery.
