"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,open,Two strange/buggy behaviours in long press popup entering negative values,[],"First: great app, love it
My environment: sony z1 compact (1280x720), android 5.1.1
I'm a programmer myself and if I had the time I would try to support this project. But in this case I'm only a User giving feedback.
(Perhaps it would be better to handle the following as two seperate issues.)

1) Popup buttons disappear when textfield gets negative.

When the popup shows I can see a textfield with a ""0"" in it and the configured buttons. When I press a button with a negative value the textfield shows the value, but all four buttons disappear. That happens always in that moment when the value in the textfield gets negative (e.g. press +5 once and 6 times -1). The space to the right of the textfield blanks out.

2) Android number keyboard does not show the value of the popup textfield.

When the popup shows the textfield shows a selected ""0"". When I click on the textfield the android number keyboard shows up fullscreen (no calculator: just buttons for digits, period, comma, minus (probably for unary reasons), space (I don't know what's that for), backspace, ""GO"" and its own textfield). It shows the ""0"", not selected and with the cursor on the left or right side depending on the touchclick I made on the popup textfield.
When I press ""-"" while the cursor is on the right side the ""-"" is not shown! But ""internal"" it is there because when I press OK a popuperror says ""invalid calculator entry"" and if I use the back button the ""0-"" is shown in the textfield of the popup (and the buttons disappeared (see 1). And if I press backspace the internal ""-"" is deleted with nothing happening in the keyboard textfield, the second backspace deletes the ""0"".
The Problem seems to be that the android number keyboard does not show every input. Probably if it thinks that this character does not lead to a valid number. But ""0-"" would be a valid term if another digit followed: ""0-2"". And this works: starting with ""0"" and cursor to the right keyboard, pressing ""-2"" shows ""02"" in the keyboard (wrong) and when I press OK the app counts ""-2"" (correct ""0-2""). So the number keyboard accepts and shows only valid numbers but still sends the ignored characters to the popup textfield and by pressing OK the app evaluates the textfield as a term.
I tested some more values. They all lead to that conclusion.

I hope you can verify that behaviour in other environments since that wouldn't mean that the sony z1c users are alone with this problem.

nolanlawson/KeepScore,open,missing features,[],"Hi,

great app for scoring - I need two features:
1. round-based scoring with negativ score-calculation:
   we are playing cards with 4 players and 32 games
   each game has 1 to 3 winners and the others are the loosers
   the scores of the winner are negativ divided / multiplied to the loosers, eg:
2. one winner 6 points => 3 loosers with -2 points
3. three winner 3 points => 1 looser with -9 points
4. two winners 4 points => two loosers with -4 points
   so it would be easy to
5. select winner(s) and entering the score => calculate the other results
6. marker(s) for the players

nolanlawson/KeepScore,open,Crash on too many rounds,[],"I still get a crash when I have enough rounds such that the numbers would drop off the bottom of the list (probably require scrolling).

I have reported the error, it gives a ClassCastException in widget.AutofitTextView.onMeasure;

It states that SpannableString cannot be cast to SpannedString.

My guess is this occurs on line 65:

ForegroundColorSpan[] foregroundColorSpans = ((SpannedString) getText()).getSpans(startOfLastLine + 1, cutoffIndex, ForegroundColorSpan.class);

as this is the only place a cast of this type occurs.

This could be fixed by instead casting to the interface (Spanned). This interface is also the interface for SpannedString anyway, so it should make no difference if this is NOT the problem. This is, however, the preferred way of dealing with casting variables in Java. Whenever possible, one should cast to the interface rather than the implementation (unless you need it). This is why you regularly see things like the following:

List myList = new ArrayList();

rather than

ArrayList myList = new ArrayList();

The Android Javadocs also state that getText() can be cast to either Spannable or Editiable (not SpannedString) depending on how it was set.

nolanlawson/KeepScore,open,"Put invocation to ""findGameById"" into AsyncTask in GameActivity.java?",[],"Dear Developers of KeepScore,

I'm a Ph.D. student and I'm doing research on improving performance

I find that in KeepScore, there is a method
""GameDBHelper.findGameById"" which accesses database. In most cases,
you put the invocation of this method into AsyncTask to improve responsiveness.
(For example, in ""findGameFromGameSummary"", ""exportToSpreadsheet"",
""saveBackup"" methods of ""MainActivity"" class).

But in GameActivity class, ""onCreate"" method invokes ""createGame"" at
line 124, which also eventually invokes ""GameDBHelper.findGameById"" at line
473. I'm whondering why don't also put this invocation of ""findGameById"" 
into background thread? Is there any specific reason that prevent you 
to use AsyncTask here?

This PR puts those buttons to work and allows you to do some basic math inside the dialog.  For example, you can type `37+3+75+3*2-21` into the edit field, and when you press <kbd>=</kbd> (or tap the dialog's OK button), the field is automatically updated with the answer &ndash; in this example, 100.

This is especially useful in games where you must add up an arbitrary number of points that range from 1 to 100 to reach the player's score for the round.

The entered expression is evaluated with [exp4j](http://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/), and things like order of operations and parentheses are properly respected.

I've also made two other tweaks:
- When you start typing in the input field, the other buttons are hidden and the input field is resized to fill available width.  This makes it easier to see longer expressions.
- I've wired up the soft keyboard's return button to accept the dialog &ndash; I find it's quicker and easier to hit that button than the OK button of the dialog for some reason.

"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Show round totals and player score averages,[],"Some users have asked for this.  Round totals are apparently necessary for certain games, and then there's also another user who requested: 

One feature that it could benefit from would be the ability to show the average score for specific or all players.
"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Fix rendering problem on MDPI devices,[],"For some reason, on my HTC Magic running Eclair, the buttons and lines don't stretch properly.  This is a change introduced with the ViewStubs post-v1.1.  Need to investigate.
"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Optimize main game layout XML,[],"The games take a long time to load, and it's because the XML layouts are very inefficient.  This needs an overhaul, preferably with liberal use of the <merge/>, <include/>, and <ViewStub/> tabs, as described here:

nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Allow for copying game,[],"The ""Reset"" dialog is confusing.  It should be replaced with Reset/Copy buttons.

"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Periodically save game,[],"Users are reporting that their scores are being erased.  My guess is that this is due to certain Android builds killing the AsyncTask that is launched from the onPause() or onDestroy() method.

The only solution I can think of is to have a background AsyncTask to periodically save the game.

"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Manage increment buttons separately,[],"Users seem to be confused by the options to manage the increment buttons, and the fact that the buttons in the popup are managed in the same way as the buttons in the 2-player layout.  They should be managed separately.

"

In KeepScore, the ""+"" button for a player on the right side of the screen is too close to these physical buttons.  The score history should be moved to the right to give a nice buffer of space.
"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Add popup buttons in 2-player view,[],"There is a lot of wasted space in the 2-player view.  The increment buttons from the popup window (-1, 1, 5, 10) could easily fit in there.
"
nolanlawson/KeepScore,closed,Add optional dark color scheme,[],"Suggested by Jordi.  The black-on-white color scheme drains the battery more heavily than white-on-black would.  It would be nice to have something in the Settings to allow the user to change this.
