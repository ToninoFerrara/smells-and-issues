After a long hiatus for unrelated reasons, I'm back to Book Catalogue again. I downloaded the latest version (I don't remember which version I had been using before my phone needed a factory reset) and imported my book database from SD card. I really like the program, but I'm experiencing a problem when I scan ISBN bar codes. The scan is successful, but immediately afterward, I get the message:

""_Sorry Can't connect to get the latest prices and offers right now. we're sorry for the inconvenience_""

Clicking the OK button in the error window takes me back to the main book list, not the book entry. The just-scanned book was correctly entered.

I assume this issue is caused by some problem in connecting to Amazon or whoever.  I searched for settings related to this, but can't seem to find any (are there any?). I also read through the Wiki and the rest of this project to no avail. I don't recall ever seeing this error before.

- Samsung Galaxy SII Skyrocket i727 (AT&T version) 
- Consumer Cellular (AT&T network, mostly)
- Android 4.1.2

- All of this was done while on WiFi and the app doesn't otherwise complain about connectivity.
- I successfully connected to GoodReads and LibraryThing.

I hope someone can help me get past this.

Thanks,

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Order of Fields not Tab-Key friendly,[],"Hi,
I started using your app. And to catalogue my books faster I am using my bluetooth keyboard instead of the android onscreen keyboard.
That is working ok-ish. But the order of fields are not in a good order.
The add button is before the Field of Author in the tab-order. So you enter the author ""shift+tab"" -> ""enter"" to add -> ""tab tab tab"" -> ""enter"" to save"".
Also with the series field its: number <- add <- series name -> list -> cancel -> save.
So the key sequence is ""series name"" -> 2x ""shift+tab"" -> ""number""-> ""tab"" -> ""enter"" to add -> ""tab tab tab tab"" -> ""enter"" to save
The order should be imho: series name -> number -> add -> list -> cancel -> save.

It works perfectly and does everything I need, with one potentially fatal flaw I think I'm getting ready to experience. Just the books I have on my internal drive take up a huge amount of space, while I have a 250GB SD card sitting there not close to full. However, Im finally getting ready to add my entire library of roughly 2000 books to your app, and if what I have in the database now is using up such a large amount of internal memory, adding 2000 more books to it will likely cause my phone to burst into flames! :-) There's GOT to be some way to store at least the thumbnails, if not the entire program on the SD card. If not, though your program is without a doubt the best book database out there, I may be forced to see if I can find a second-rate substitute before I start this daunting project. I REALLY don't want to do that, since again I love what you've done, but I simply won't have enough internal memory to store the incoming thumbnails.

These past years I've been almost exclusively reading books from Amazon and litres.ru on my Kindle. Is there a trick to quickly scan those? I didn't find anything in the app, and the only thing I can think of is manually entering all the ISBNs, which sounds even more exhausting than scanning and reorganizing all those paper books. :)

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Structural suggestion to support WORK rather than books,[],"Hello,

(I will be able to translate in English if necessary)

Very very good application but a major structural problem, and some suggestions for significant improvement.
FYI, I have 4000 titles of works + 5000 BDs ... and the habit of management tools!

1- Structure: The main need is to identify a WORK, not the title of the book, the book, the paper object or the digital file containing this work. This makes it possible to know if one has it to read it, to lend it, to buy it ... even if it is within a paper or digital object with different title.
However, the title of the work is not necessarily the title of the book: collection of short stories (eg S. King), Anthology (eg French poetry), integral works (eg ""All Sherlock Holmes"") , collection (ex: library of the Pleiade Gallimard).

For this, I propose the following development:
- instead of ""Anthology"", create a field ""Title of the work"". We can not actually list the titles of your anthology, or even do a search (the words of the titles in the anthology are not recognized by your search engine).
Base your main database on this Work field and not Work field (= ""Title"" field of your current base).
- place this new field after the title of the work, with a default copy of the title of the work (most common case = Identical title for work and work).
- to allow the seizure of several works under the same title of work (cf the principle of the multiple authors), possibly with multiple authors (also possible to consider the title of the work like a simple field informant, like the other metadata, l work, which can be in several different works: a fairy tale of Grimm can be in the integral of Grimm and also in a collection of tales of the world).
- provide a field specifying the status of the work within the book: Roman, short story, story, poem, preface, comment (incremental list). Preface and commentary are sometimes real works when the authors are famous: Translation of Poe by Baudelaire ...
- allow sorting by the Work, as with other fields (it should be even the main entrance to the base!).
=> this does not change anything for the input by isbn which gives the work, but the metadata of this work can be duplicated on several works.

2- Moreover, another difficulty of your current base is that it does not distinguish the Series (ex: ""Human Comedy"" of Balzac) from the Publishing Collection (ex: ""Library of the Pleiade"", Black River, Folio, Pocket Book). Two different fields would be more relevant than mixing the two by entering them in multiple sets in the Series field.

3- Storage: rather than Library (= Rays, why 2 different names?) And Location, not very explicit, present this:

A- either in clear hierarchical fields (allows filter and sort on each):
- Library, to distinguish the collection of Mr. and Mrs. for example or 2 different houses (= my case)
- Room / Furniture / Shelf / Location (ex: front / back when multiple rows on the same shelf)

B- either (- powerful) with a powerful search (filters function not present in your tool ??? Filter ""Location"" field contains ""et2"" and ""rg4"") on a single ""Location"" field where you enter in code this last in standard personal format. ""Lieu_Piece_Meuble_Étagère_Emplacement"".
 
Other improvements:

4- create the Filter function on all fields, with multiple titles and filter backup. See your Sort function.

5- add 5 customizable free fields:
- 1 numeric field (eg if each book is tagged with a unique personal code)
- 1 incremental list field (eg if you want to add a ""Book status"" field)
- 1 free text field (eg to isolate notes always of the same nature: state of the book, personal notes of reading ...)
- 1 yes / no field (eg to help when updating / completing the cards after a quick entry: ""completed form"" Yes / No)
- 1 Date field (eg ""Sheet updated to"" Date).

Hoping that these constructive suggestions I hope will help you make your application my Grail!

I am willing to collaborate to refine these suggestions and test them.

Regards,
LUCM"

""Maktub nÃ£o Ã© um livro de conselhos, mas uma troca de experiÃªncias. A maior parte dos textos se refere a ensinamentos que Paulo Coelho recebeu de seu mestre ao longo de 11 anos.

Finalmente, existem trechos de livros que ele leu e de histÃ³rias que pertencem Ã  heranÃ§a espiritual da raÃ§a humana. <br /><br />A proposta do autor Ã© reunir um apanhado da sabedoria universal destacando um ponto comum a todas as histÃ³rias: a busca da felicidade. Embora o desejo de ser feliz seja relatado em contextos tÃ£o diversos, fica fÃ¡cil concluir que, nÃ£o importa o lugar ou a Ã©poca, ele sempre se baseia nos mesmos pilares: amor, humildade, solidariedade e renÃºncia. <br /><br />Maktub oferece aos leitores uma oportunidade de refletir e se reencontrar. <br /><br />Se vocÃª estÃ¡ percorrendo o caminho de seus sonhos, comprometa-se com ele.

Sie führt eine umfassende Datenbank von Büchern und Buchbesprechungen, und wenn Sie ein registrierter Benutzer von Goodreads sind, kann BookCatalogue Ihre Bücher, Bücherregale und Buchbesprechnungen exportieren und importieren. BookCatalogue ist eine eigenständige App und erfordert keine Verbindung zu Goodreads, aber wenn Sie möchten, können Sie sich hier registrieren:</string>
    <string name=""goodreads_auth_blurb_part2"">Als registrierter Nutzer können Sie den Zugriff von BookCatalogue auf Ihre Daten bei Goodreads autorisieren. Drücken Sie dazu den Button unten.

Wir werden Ihr Kennwort nie sehen, und Sie können den Zugriff auf der Website von Goodreads jederzeit beenden. Wegen der Unwägbarkeiten des Webs kann es sein, dass Sie anschließend auf eine leeren Seite landen. Klicken Sie einfach auf den \""Zurück\""-Button, um hierher zurückzukehren!</string>

    <string name=""explain_goodreads_no_isbn"">Das gewählte Buch hat keine ISBN; eine automatische Synchronisation mit Goodreads ist nicht möglich. Die einfachste Lösung ist:         \n
  \n
  (1) löschen Sie das Buch aus BookCatalogue         \n
  \n
  (2) fügen Sie das Buch manuell in Goodreads auf der Website ein.         \n
  \n
  (3) Synchronisieren Sie mit Goodreads         \n
  \n
  Damit wird das Buch in BookCatalogue wieder erzeugt und die beiden sind von nun an verbunden.</string>
    <string name=""explain_goodreads_no_match"">Die ISBN des gewählten Buchs könnte nicht in Goodreads gefunden werden. Dafür gibt es zwei mögliche Ursachen: Entweder sind die Daten des Buchs falsch (Sie sollten die ISBN überprüfen) oder das Buch gibt es nicht in googdreads.         \n
  \n
  Wenn Sie die Daten in BookCatalogue ändern, drücken sie den \'Wiederholen\'-Button und überprüfen Sie, ob die Hintergrundaufgabe erfolgreich ist.         \n
  \n
  Wenn die Daten korrekt wirken und das Buch trotzdem nicht gefunden wird, muss ein Buch mit dieser ISBN manuell zu Goodreads über deren Website hinzugefügt werden. Sobald das geschehen ist, können Sie versuchen, das Buch erneut zu senden.</string>

I've been using the Loan/Location fields somewhat unconventionally.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,"Feature Request - ""Missing Series Books"" Bookshelf with autofill",[],"Great App.

One thing that would be very useful is an automatically filled bookshelf called ""Missing Series Books"" that goes through the existing bookshelves (or at least the main one), and see which books in a series are not included somewhere in the lists.

This serves 2 purposes.  First if a book in the series was missed, this will notify the user they should go back and get it.  Second if a new book comes out it will let the user know that the next book has become available so they can keep current.

Example - the user has all the Women's Murder Club books through 13 but is missing 3.  The ""Missing Series Books"" would autofill with James Patterson ""3rd Degree"", ""14th Deadly Sin"" and ""15th Affair"".

Once the user gets the book they can move it from the ""missing"" bookshelf to a regular bookshelf.

Thanks for the great app."

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Import from CSV,[],"Hello,
Firstly, thanks for this software. It works well.

I have a lot of Ebooks and I wanted to import them into my catalogue so I wrote some software to extract data from each Ebook and build a csv file for import.

I formatted the csv file as your documentation said, but it would not import all my books, it seemed to stop after around 200 or so books.

So I exported my existing books to a CSV file, checked the format and found that there is an extra field 'language' (after ""genre"") that doesn't appear in the documentation.

Even after adding this field to my csv file, it seems that I can't get some books to import. It still seems to stop after about 200 books or so (I'm importing around 600 books in one csv file).

The most likely cause is that there is an issue with my CSV file format (I'm still looking at it).

My questions are:
1) Is there a limit to the number of books that can be imported from a csv file?
2) Is there a way I can quickly delete all books in the database leaving all other data untouched (author/genre/bookshelves etc)? So far I've uninstalled, re-installed and recovered a backup, this seems to do it but it's a bit drastic.

My best regards, Andrew Bools."
eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,"Not an issue, just a recommendation. Not sure the proper forum for this.",[],"I have been using Book-catalogue for a few years now.  I was wondering if there was a way to have the loaned book information sync to goodreads. Goodreads does not have a loan option, so I was thinking it can be made as a note, or somehow attached to the note section. It would have to be an option that is turned on and off by users as some use the Note section in Goodreads for other information, but i'm one that doesn't use it, so was thinking it can be used as a defacto place to input the loan information... more specifically, the name of the user.  

When in goodreads, if we put anything in the note (a name of a person), it would go to the loaned section in Catalogue. If we delete it in goodreads, it would remove the loan.

I don't know if this is possible, I don't have any coding knowledge.   If you are somehow able to do this, Book-Catalogue would be the only app with this option out there. WOULD BE SOOOOO COOL!

I'm a teacher and use your app to keep track of the books my students borrow from my classroom.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Thumbnails on highres screens,"[Label(name=""Defect""), Label(name=""Request"")]","Via email

Hi,

I have been using Book Catalogue for a while without issues on a moto-g,
I really like this application, it's very useful to keep track of my
comic collection.

Recently I have changed my mobile phone (it's a samsung s4 GT-I9505 with
a recent version of cyanogenmod).

I moved the library, creating a backup, and imported it on the s4, all
books were properly imported, all the thumbnails are present, and can be
seen in the book list and book edit pages, however the majority of
thumbnails weren't visible in the book detail page.

I have tried to replicate the problem without having to import the
database, and I can reproduce the issue with a clean installation of
book catalogue, by simply adding the book with isbn 9788877591937.

With a closer inspection of the screenshot (attached), the thumbnail is
not absent, but it shows as a small line of pixels.

I thought that it can be somehow related to the resolution of the
thumbnail and did some tests changing the image sizes.

If the thumbnail has a resolution of 200x193 the detail page shows the
image, if the thumbnail has a resolution of 200x194 it is not visible
(or is shrinked).

I suspect the issue has something to do with the high screen resolution
of the device (1080 x 1920) and the proportion ratio of the thumbnail
and how those two are combined to calculate the final thumbnail size.

Attached also the backup of the archive, and the database dump.

If needed I can do other tests in order to debug the issue, I am a
developer and know my way on a linux system (unfortunately I don't know
enough about android development to provide a patch).

I would really appreciate it if you could find some time to look into
this issue.

thanks

I'm not yet finished digitalizing the data of my library, but all I can see are the covers (300+ files). It's hard to find the export files, for instance.

I believe that the application should use several subdirectories inside the `bookCatalogue` directory.

For instance I would do the following:
- leave the exports in `bookCatalogue` as it's something people actively want and expect to find in the default directory of the application;

This will probably require that strings.xml contains all the language names, but it shouldn't be too hard to have those translations found / done for supported languages. I can do it for French, for instance if given a list of language names you want to be translated and a template to put into, similar to

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Make auto-capitalization optional,"[Label(name=""In Beta"")]","The application in its current form considers only the English language when it comes to book title capitalization.

In French, the capitalization of titles is totally different and the rules are really complex (it depends on the kind of title: is it a sentence or just words, what words are used, the order of the words, etc.).

Most of the time, Amazon and friends get those correct but the application tries its best by applying the English language rule which forces me to manually (and painfully) edit every single title. Also, when editing a title, the application forces me in a ""capitalizing"" keyboard, which is painful because I most often have to uncapitalize letters, forcing me to select the letter, remove capitalization then rewrite the letter.

The rules for capitalization in French are complex and I don't expect an application to get them right without proper French semantic analysis. The English Wikipedia has a summary of how [French titles should be capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/France_and_French-related#Capitalization). Yet it doesn't cover everything, which is actually a kind of compromise, and [more covered on the French Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Conventions_typographiques#Titres_d.27.C5.93uvres_.28livres.2C_films.2C_etc..29).

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Turkish fixes:,[],"i) Replace ""betik"" with ""kitap"". There was a partial patch in 83860a4cefc14878, this commit replaces all occurrences.
Using ""betik"" instead of kitap is an esoteric attempt to remove the arabic loan word ""kitap"" and use the pure Turkish word ""betik"" instead.
""betik"" technically means any written document but never used in place of ""kitap"" in modern Turkish.
It comes from the ancient Turkish word ""bitig"" (written documents, books, etc).
""betik"" has a place in modern Turkish as a translation for ""script"".

ii) Remove the esoteric ""Tor beti"" with ""Ağ sayfası"" (web page).
""sayfa"" is again an arabic load word, although ""ağ"" is Turkish, however ""tor"" is used by other Turkic nations, although not Turkey.
""bet"" is coming from the ""bitig"" root ""bit(i)"" (see above).
Almost 99.99% of the Turks won't have a clue about ""tor beti"" which is again an attempt
to replace the loan words (actually just the ""web"" part) with pure Turkish (and a bit invented) words.

The only issue, so far, in my opinion, is the Author sorting option. It currently sorts by the author's last name, but here in Brazil the authors are usually known by their First Name. Is there a way or any plan on adding this in a future update? It would turn my cataloguing life much easier :D 

My library currently contains 200+ books from a lot of different authors and sometimes it's a pain to find a book without using the Search option haha

Thanks in advance!

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Maximum number of books,[],"Hi
I'm planning on using your app for a relatively straightforward way of uploading a number of books in my small secondhand bookshop to my Amazon seller account via the BookLoader inventory spreadsheet (to save me A LOT of typing!).
I was just wondering if there is a maximum number of books / entries that your app supports, both in terms of the app itself and in the export file? Ideally I will be able to use it to inventory my entire Amazon stock at once, which may be up to around 10,000 books. If it won't support this number then I will have to export the data to a different piece of inventory management software before  exporting to Amazon. That will be fine (just take a bit longer), but I just need to know before I start!
Thanks
Krystl
PS - perhaps you should consider having an alternative export option where the format matches the format required by amazon - I would happily pay a reasonable amount for this! There are very few free book inventory management software out there and it can be quite awkward to convert to Amazon format. Also, none of them (that I have found so far) include an app with a barcode scanner.

Bulk modify would be very helpful; I've seen other requests for it.  I just moved half my collection to new shelves we just built. Before, I had an ""in my head"" filing system that was outgrowing my head, so half my books should be in location newShelves (and are alphabetical) and the other half is in the original location in ""ad hoc"" sort.

Maybe go into ""bulk select"" mode and have checkboxes instead of green ""read"" checkmarks.  Guess you could export to CSV, but I'm nervous about that given some of Excel's idiosyncrasies.  On that note, I've seen discussions that imply loading different (bcbk?) lists and merging them, but can't find that anywhere.  Do you use different directories?

I'd add another vote for sort by added date full granularity.  Now it has each day, then listed by author.  If I'm spending a Saturday adding books and realized that a certain series or logging handwriting on covers needed to be fixed, it would help if I could get an in-order list to debug when the screwups started.

Add another vote for honorific fields, etc.  Would help sorting by last name, but I don't know what the locale implications are.  Would also be interesting to know how many books I have by PhD's vs. D.D.'s vs. MD's, etc.

Calibre integration w/ pics would be cool, but I realize that would be non-trivial.

Also, when you export to CSV, the date is sometimes mm-dd-yy and others are mm/dd/yy, other times mm-yy.  Personally, I'd like mm/dd/yyyy or you could just use straight up ctime().  If no month or day is given, split the difference, and use consistent separators.

Thanks all for the project documentation that is pretty good.
I would like to suggest to add some details not found in file 'BUILDING' that took me some time : 

Step 1 (could maybe be done in Git repo if it doesn't break the release build): 
- create a src folder in StartupActivity named ""localsrc""
- create an empty class com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue.amazon.AmazonAppKey in that folder
  - add field public static final String KEY = null; to this class
- create an empty com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue.goodreads.GoodreadsApiKeys in that folder
  - add field public static final String GOODREADS_DEV_KEY = null ;
  - add field public static final String GOODREADS_DEV_SECRET = null ; 

Step2 : let amazon integration works by following how to at : https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/apis/earn/mobile-associates

Step3 : let GoodReads integration by filling the form found at https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys (goodreads account required)

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,another suggestion,[],"I'm back :-) with what I think would be a pretty easy to implement improvement...

Wouldn't it be nice if one could change the input type from the lookup pages (enter isbn, search internet, and add manually), if there were a button one could switch to other types (including scan) from. (clear?)
When I am doing a row of books, I frequently have to switch from one type to another ...back out, click up, wait for menu, etc. It would be nice to go directly. (I don't include the isbn scan page as a lookup, cause it jumps to a different app and I imagine it would be impossible...? It would be ideal though...) This way I could do everything in two passes, one pass for all the scannable isbn's and another pass for lookups (combined).

Even if you don't like the suggestion, I should I appreciate what you have done. Why am I giving you so many suggestions? I've tried a bunch of other similar book apps, all quite unsatisfying, and this one finally does what it is supposed to do. Hooray!

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,suggestions,[],"app is working well. I have always hoped I could scan in my library of >3000 books, and it now it looks like it might be manageable!

A few suggestions for improvements:
1. You can sort the main list by date added, but I would like sort it by time added...not date, so I can see the books most recently added at the top...
2. I have been able to import the csv file into calibre using import list plugin in calibre, but the following issues arise:
   multiple authors are separated by ""|"" but that bombs. I need to manually change those to other things.
   There is no way to import pictures, as far as I can see. I guess uuid could be used for that, but I am not sure how that would be done. This is a shame, since you have already gone to the trouble of getting the pictures, it would be nice not to have to tell calibre to redo it. 
3. There appears to be no way to change the bookshelf for a particular item, or better yet, a group of items. In fact, some multibook field editing would be a nice feature. 
4. GUI would be improved if long clicking  at the appropriate place near book field (without interfering with the copy/paste longclick) would automatically bring you to the edit page  & field, instead of clicking at the top + scrolling. And then, being able to swipe from book to book in edit mode would be nice, too.

Use case: i tend to key in ISBNs manually, since i'm faster than the scanner process, and the scanner process mis-fills (or requires painful override for things like shelves and anthology keys).  It's easier for me to do the 10-digit ;-).

Possibly the best win would be for a user-option for  either form of ISBN entry to fill ""both"" fields (i realize that it's probably currently a single field, and possibly the primary key), or for BookCat to ""fake"" the 2nd form.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Locale-based searching,"[Label(name=""Feature""), Label(name=""Request"")]","## Background
### The Problem

Users search for, say, german books in germany and get english descriptions.

This is not always the case, but is likely if the search is done by title, or if the ISBN was reused.

The Amazon API, and maybe others, support locales. Amazon supports 10 of them.
### Some Issues

Unfortunately, the Amazon API (when searching in Germany), does NOT always return English books; meaning we get ""no results"".

If an ISBN has been reused, then the user may want English or German versions.
## An Approach

Allow the user to to the following:
- specify the order of search engines (we have to be careful because LibraryThing does not support Author/Title searches, so they would need to be last in those cases).
- allow the user to specify an (optional) Amazon locale to search
- allow the user to specify goodreads/LT/google locales (if supported)
- each needs to have their own daltabase-specific locale list. They probably don't all support the same set of locales in their API
- put the locale-based search engines at the front of the list, then english-based searches will only be used to ""fill in the blanks"".
- (optional) allow the user to disable some search engines
- (optional) allow the user to reconfigure this on a per-search basis, and/or have ""search profiles"" allowing for multiple locales

I'm not certain if the data for the field can be pulled from the current sources, but then again, it could always be manually populated if necessary.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Bug: residual thumbnail after Cancel entry-by-isbn,[],"If i do an enter-by-ISBN, and either the publisher blew it (or reused the ISBN) or if it's one of my ""guess the ISBN from the SSN"" exercises (see issue 586), i may get the 'wrong"" book offered in the entry fields.
OK... so i click Cancel and then choose ""Add Book Manually"".
The entry screen appears... but the _thumbnail_ from the previous ""wrong ISBN"" is still there.
From the Entry screen i can't seem to delete it (i have to re-select the book later through MyBooks and Edit it out).

No other field is ""polluted"" like that, only the thumbnail.

The only (simple) way i've found of clearing it is to do another add-by-isbn that i know will be successful.
Then i can switch to ""Add Manually"" and i'll be working into a clean (i.e. no thumbnail) Entry screen.

thanks for your consideration

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Feature request: SSN entry choice on ISBN screen,[],"There are many books carrying an SSN number which can frequently be entered as ISBN by adding a prefix digit and the checksum digit  (if we're lucky, the SSN with checksum may be on the copyright page).  (SSN is also occasionally known as ""book seller number"")
My request is for a button/check (like the ASIN checkbox) which would ask BookCat to calculate the missing checksum before doing the ISBN lookup.  My current work-around is to prefix with a zero, and then postfix with zero (search/invalid/<= (delete zero)) one (search/invalid/<= (delete one)) two ... (repeat until ""valid ISBN"" achieved and it does the lookup).
Although tedious, that gives me a better than 70% successful hit rate.
It would be nice if BookCat could remove the tedium of (nearly) blind trial-and-error.

(my workaround triggers a (dare i say it?) bug in BookCatalog, which i'll file as the next issue: residual thumbnail after Cancel)

thanks, great app (donation to follow, making it my first ""paid"" app)

I was going to ask for a bulk mode where I'd be back to the scanner window immediately (which is probably easiest to implement) But now I've been thinking a bit more, the ideal situation would be if it would ""beep"" that it has the barcode, allow me to move the camera away from the book I have for about a second and then start scanning for barcodes again. A side plane should then show: got barcode XXX, looking up barcode. Found book YYYY, queued for addition....

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Feature request: book translations,[],"Hi,

I would like to start using this app and this feature would be a deal maker.

We own a lot of translated books so my own collection contains several fields that are not available in Book-Catalogue (yet): the language a book is written in and the original title and original language.
This helps to find books of which you already own a copy in a different language.
I checked goodread after discovering it through this app and noticed that they offer this information so I hope it is relatively easy to add.

e.g. http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6563582-het-oog-van-tzulan contains buth the Dutch title and the original German title.

It might be best implemented in after 5.1. Options include:
- from a bookshelf, or from a search result list, select 'Send These Books to Archive'

and/or
- from the 'Advanced' options in the archive allow selection based on:
  - one or more selected shelves
  - book 'read'

- define intents implemented by a reader app to allow BC to query ePub info

ultimately, it would be great to encourage the major readers to implement these intents and support our intents...but in the mean time, if epub3reader keeps developing (and there is every sign it will) then we have a great way to move forward with reader integration.

The problem is this:
I have real duplicates - two copies of the same books. On my real bookshelves I just put them into a specially dedicated bookshelf for future sell/donations.
Would like to have an ability to track the contents of this real-life bookshelf  also. Right now the application does inform me that I am adding a duplicate but it is difficult to find such duplicates later - I have to manually scan the list in hope to notice the duplicates. And when I do notice them - I am not really sure is this a real duplicate or just my crooked fingers scanned the same book twice?

One possible solution I see is a field ""number of copies"" in book description and an ability to hide all single-copy books. This would show what I can suggest for trade during the book-club meetings.

Thoughts?

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,UPC to ISBN -- possible?,[],"From a user:

> I read in my library, but I found that many of the books have an older style bar code that couldn't be used. These appear to be a UPC code instead of a ISBN code. With a little hunting around I found that you can convert these UPC codes into an ISBN. Here is a link to the site describing how to do this...
> 
> http://www.librarything.com/wiki/index.php/ISBN
> 
> I also found a good page that defines how to simply calculate the check digit that is needed when converting the UPC code to an ISBN code...
> 
> http://www.teach-ict.com/as_a2_ict_new/ocr/AS_G061/311_data_info_knowledge/validation_verification/miniweb/pg5.htm
> 
> It would be a great addition to the ISBN bar code scanner option to do the following... When the scanner gets a code it doesn't understand, it assume it is a UPC code and try converting it to an ISBN code before giving up. 

Based on a very quick scan of the second web page it looks like it might be possible to do, but I'm not sure how reliable it would be. Also, we may have problems verifying the scan is a UPC vs. just a bad scan.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Integrated wishlist functionality,[],"From a user:

> The ""Wishlist"" bookshelf should be an integrated part of the app and when a book is scanned a prompt that it is on the wishlist should appear not that it is a duplicate.

There would be a few ways of doing this:
- add the ability to mark a single shelf as a 'Wishlist'
- add a 'wishlist' flag to a book, then use that flag as a filter in book list styles, as well as -- making it a virtual shelf.

I tend to prefer the latter since the 'wishlist' flag is more properly a book attribute and might form the model for other flags in the future (eg. to-read, to-sell) -- though for the most part, I detest the idea of truck loads of flags on a book.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Feature request: collapsed series,[],"When you are using ""Author then Series"" view and expand an Author - all his/her series are also expands. This behavior is fine for a small series (3-5 books), but then you are storing manga - it become scary. The manga series are often 10-30 books, popular series goes far, for example Inuyasha - 58 volumes, One Piece is 70 volumes and  still continuing...
So, I would really like to see Series collapsed by default. 

In collapsed mode the series should have the name, total number of volumes and the name of the last volume.

It would be nice to have a combined list of volume numbers, like ""1-3,6-34"" which would instantly show that I still need to find volumes 4,5 and 35+. But I understand it is not the easiest task if volume numbers are not exactly numbers (for example ""collection 4,5,6""). But in such cases - the name of the last volume would suffice.

And of course, the expanded series will look like it does now.

It would scan it and capture the barcode number - which is different than the ISBN - and tell me that it is not a valid ISBN.

Sawyer == W W Sawyer), b) middle name represented as initial vs middle name as full name, c) strange or inconsistent formattings of names that include tick marks - e.g., Russian names, d) handle badly formatted author names, e.g., those that include a title (e.g., Ph.D.) or a suffix (Jr), e) a blacklist for things that are not names entered in the author field (e.g., I have multiple books that have the authors ""Mathematics"" and ""Physics""), and f) etc. etc.

There would be three goals: a) eliminate duplicate variant spellings of name for a single book (which I see quite a lot), b) correctly mark multiple books by same author when names are spelled differently, and c) provide a canonical formatting of author names (e.g., either with or without periods and spaces after initials, either using full middle names or only initials, etc.).

[Implementation note: much of the above can be handled on the device with some kinds of rules for text processing - which unfortunately may be language dependent! - but a possible way to see if two books are written by the same author when the names are spelled differently might be to data mine from some web site or web service, e.g., look at Amazon author pages ...]

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Idea: Associate Icon with a bookshelf,[],"### Purpose

This is intended as a tool for users to gain greater visual meaning from book lists.
### The basic idea is
- a book shelf can have an optional icon associated with it
- if a bookshelf has an icon, then when the user selects the 'Show Bookshelves' option in the list 'extras', it will show the icon instead of the name (or as well)

Possible uses include:
- 'To Buy' shelf associate with the '$' icon; gives the user an immediate signal that they do not own this book
- 'To Read' shelf associate with an icon depicting a book (or something like that)
- 'Reference' shelf associate with a 'Library' icon (or something like that)'
- 'Whodunnit' shelf associated with a magnifying glass icon
### Discussion

These are just examples of what a user might choose to do. To make it work, we could need a fairly decent collection of icons as well as (_maybe_) the ability for users to add their own.

In the absence of a standard reader API, this _might_ be a good first step.

The key problem with this is:
- most epub files on Kindle have garbled names (may be true for others)
- many readers insist on storing the epubs in their own directory, so it is not clear which location to use
- it cries our for the next and most obvious step which would be to scan for ePubs, but they are almost invariably impossible to read and I forsee many annoyed users asking for this

I suspect this results from onActivityResult() being called before onResume(), but need to check code carefully.

USER_COMMENT=Good afternoon from Italy! This happened while just scanning in yet another book in my collection of 200+ books, and had never happened before in approx. 3 weeks of use. I realise this won't probably be of great help, but I can't provide better details, sorry!
By the way, if you need help improving the Italian translation, I would be very glad to contribute. Just let me know.

description->Kätzchen sind unwiderstehlich: Mit ihren tapsigen Bewegungen, großen Augen und dem flauschigen Fell erobern sie unsere Herzen im Sturm. Die Autorin Brigitte Eilert-Overbeck liefert in diesem Ratgeber das Basiswissen über die richtige Haltung, Beschäftigung und Gesunderhaltung von Kätzchen. Das geballte Praxiswissen der Autorin und eine Fülle an Tipps und Ideen machen das Buch zu einem unverzichtbaren Ratgeber für jeden Katzenfreund. Tolle Sonderseiten vermitteln das Wissen auf attraktive Weise, so hilft z. B. der ""Verhaltensdolmetscher"" bei der Kommunikation mit dem Tier. ""Auf einen Blick"" erklärt in Wort und Bild die Sinnesleistungen des Tieres. Unter ""Tut gut - besser nicht!"" erfahren Sie, auf was es in den ersten Tagen mit dem neuen Hausbewohner ankommt. Und die 10 GU-Erfolgstipps fassen die Informationen am Ende des Buches prägnant zusammen. Haben Sie nach der Lektüre noch Fragen? Dann schreiben Sie an den Verlag. Dank GU Experten-Service haben Sie den direkten Draht zum Fachmann.

By using fragments, fragment tasks etc, these should be removed.

Version 5.0.8 adds more debugging to analyze.

Probably relates to the really buggy EditText/TextView implementation in 4.1 and 4.1.1, but would be nice to develop a work-around.

See this comment https://github.com/eleybourn/Book-Catalogue/issues/505#issuecomment-25216775 for a description of how to reproduce, though it does not work for me in 4.0.3 (HTC) or 4.3 (Nexus).

Love the app, it is already making a tedious job much easier. Just asking for a bit of polish now.

It does not seem too unreasonable to allow limited changes, eg,

One possibility is:
- long-click on any field brings up a unique field-specific editor. eg. long-click on 'rating' or 'read' would bring up a small
  dialog with:
  - read checkbox
  - date started
  - date finished
  - rating

(ie. all four appear no matter which of the four you clicked)

The same could be done for 'description', author/title, series, publication details etc

Not sure best way to proceed.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Various additions,[],
eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Future Plans for Archives,"[Label(name=""Feature""), Label(name=""Wishlist"")]","# Some things for Backup/Restore in 5.x
## Incremental Backup

Use the last full archive date (or a 'requires_backup' flag) to select records to backup. Probably can't just use a date because an import may create 'new' records with update dates in the past.

Possibly add a 'last_backup_date' to each book, or add a 'backup_history' table.

This needs to be thought through carefully to allow for:
- simple updates
- updates via import
- importing your own backups
- importing someone else's full or partial backup
### Suggested Implementation

DO NOT USE LAST_BACKUP_DATE method; this means every backup would update every book!

Add a new field 'instance_update_date' to books; this will be set to 'current time' on EVERY update or insert. This is distinct from 'update_date' which, in an import, will be set to the value store in the archive or CSV file.

Compare 'instance_update_date' to the last backup date stored in preferences, and use this to derive the list of books.
- simple updates WORKS (all updates will be backed up)
- updates via import WORKS (all imported records need to be backed up)
- importing your own backups WORKS (all imported records need to be backed up)
- importing someone else's full or partial backup WORKS 

The only real downside above is that after restoring a full backup on an empty database, the system will want you to perform a backup...
### Further analysis required....

I started to implement this on 5.0 sources; unfortunately, the way our export currently runs, if one changes the name of an author, one needs to mark all books referring to that author as dirty. Ditto renaming shelves and series.

It means that renaming one shelf could result in hundreds of books being included in the next incremental backup. Similarly, renaming a series affects all books in the series.

This may be good, but some clarity of thought (and analysis) is required.
## Partial restore

Only update books/covers if newer record is found archive.

Implementation is easy: just get the update_date from the book record in the archive and compare it to the database record for the book, if it exists.
## Destructive Restore
### Suggested implementation:

Use the 'instance_update_date' from above.

Perform an 'import' then delete any book that does not have a 'instance_update_date' at or after the restoration job started. More safely:
- at start of job, get max('instance_update_date') from database
- perform import
- delete all books with 'instance_update_date' <= max value retrieved at start

If you really want to be paranoid, before doing the delete, make sure count of books with 'instance_update_date' > max value == number of books imported.
### Original plan:

Keep track of which UUIDs are added during a restore (create 'restored_uuids' table for this pupose and clear it before a restore).

Any book or cover with a UUID not in the table after the restore will be deleted.

This is probably the simplest method of a more traditional restore; the prospect of recreating the database and somehow swapping the active database at runtime is not appealing.
## User-selectable classes to backup/restore

Allow the user to select some or all of the possible classes to backup/restore. Classes include:
- books
- covers
- styles
- preferences

It's probably not unreasonable to just restore settings and/or styles, for example.

It's also nice to backup without covers because the file is soooo much smaller.
## Automatic warning

Simple implementation:

get last backup date from prefs then 

```
select count(*) from books where 'instance_update_date' >= [last backup date]
```

if > 0, warn user...

Once we have the ability to detect ""unbacked-up changes"", we can tailor our automatic backup message to appear only when necessary and to tell the user what is missing.

It is worth pondering, however. And documenting.

> Sorting order: The Scandinavian languages have 3 letters more than English. They are å, ä and ö and are at the very end of the alphabet. German sorting mixes these letters in with the As and the Os as to Germans they are the same letter with a changed sound, i.e. umlaut. Sorry, this is about diacritics, but sorting, not searching. Here is a suggestion from way back: ""When the program detects any diacritic in a sortable field it should open up a check box (like the new ASIN) asking if the diacritic should be used in sorting or ignored. The user clicks YES if Swedish, etc. but ignores the check box if French, Spanish, German, etc.""

Ths suggestion would work, but necessitates storing two copies of every sortable string. This would include:
- author
- title
- publisher
- format
- others?

My preference is to wait for the ability to associate a locale with every string. Then I will probably buy my ski tickets for hell. Just saying.

My thinking:

The main obstacle is that in order for us to send reminders, we need to
have access to the contacts list, and people get _really_ gnarly about
that (understandably so).

So, how about, as a very broad spec:
- _if_ you load a book to anyone, you get a 'Books on Loan' entry in the
  main screen.
- 'books on loan' is arranged as:
  'Overdue'

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,(Somehow) link 'read' books to a 'read' shelf,"[Label(name=""Feature""), Label(name=""Request""), Label(name=""Wishlist"")]","This was a suggestion from a user based on goodreads experience.

This seems like a good general feature to add.

It's not clear how best to implement it.

**Option 1 is:**
- allow the user the option of specifying a single shelf (with any name) as their 'read' shelf. This wuold be a checkbox on the 'edit shelf' activity.
- only one shelf can be a 'read' shelf.
- adding a book to this shelf marks the book as 'read'
- removing a book from this shelf clears the 'read' flag on the book
- setting the 'read' flag on a book puts it on this shelf
- clearing the 'read' flag on a book removes it from this shelf
- import from goodreads 'read' shelf updates the nominated 'read' shelf, not the one named 'read'. Similar on send to goodreads.
- on upgrade, offer the user the option to select a shelf to be their 'read' shelf.

This can _probably_ be all done with triggers, except it involves recursion (though does not need it), so may break in early android. Careful testing would be needed.

**Option 2 is:**

Virtual 'read' and 'unread' shelves. Would need:
- preference for virtual shelf names; would default to localized version of 'Read' and 'Unread'
- upgrade would rename existing shelf with same name
- code to prevent a shelf with that name being created/renamed
- selecting the 'read' shelf would limit queries to only 'read' books, but with no actual shelf to filter. Similar for 'Unread'
- import from goodreads would only set 'read' flag; no read/unread shelves would be created

**In all options:**
- export would export the 'read' shelf as a normal shelf, redundant but clear

**Preferred Solution**

Option 2 at this stage.

Comments welcome!

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Counter-intuitive UI when editing assignment to bookshelf,[],"In the ""edit book"" dialogue it is not obvious how to change the assignment of a book between one or several bookshelves. Example: initially a book is assigned to bookshelf ""Reading"". When I click on the button ""select bookshelves"", all my bookshelves appear, none of which is checked. Not even the ""Reading bookshelf"". When I now select ""Read"" and ok, the book is now assigned to two shelves, read and reading. The only way I can unassign from Reading is to stay in the select bookshelves, select ""reading"", ok, than go back in ""select bookshelves"" (now the ""reading"" is active), unselect ""reading"" again. ok and save. Or something like that. I'm not saying it is impossible, it is however pretty fiddly.

My guess is that by design all the checkboxes should be marked when an assignment exists, and should be editable in that way.

A side-effect of the above behaviour is that you can also have a book assigned to one bookshelf more than once, at least in the ""edit book"" screen. But that could be just an update flaw, not that important. I also wonder if it makes sense that there seems to be a default assignment to the last bookshelf used by a previous edit once you add a new book, but also that would not be a problem, if the editing of the assignment would be more obvious.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,"Add a ""list duplicates"" button",[],"Adding this as a reminder to myself for something I wish to add, though it might also be useful for other people.

I would occasionally find it useful to be able to produce a list of duplicate books, e.g. if like me you have some duplicates due to adding collections together, or accidental buys (pre-Book-Catalogue ;)), it would be useful to know which you can give away, etc.

I know this could be done at the time they are added to the database, but this may not be convenient (e.g. if some books are in storage and you wish to select the best copy to keep, etc.)

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,"Give option to have ""standard"" numerical ISBN keypad in landscape mode",[],"For want of a better barcode scanner I use ZXing. Unfortunately this only operates in landscape mode so I'm then forced to use the landscape ISBN keyboard (well not forced, but you know what I mean).

This keyboard layout is rather unintuitive for me, though I understand the reasoning as it uses more space than the portrait one would in landscape mode. Nevertheless, I'd find it easier to tap in numbers on a smaller but standard layout numeric keypad and I imagine I'm not the only one.

Dreadful books, purchased in the dim distant past that are just embarrassing.

Would be nice to mark these as 'Do not share' or 'Do not share with goodreads'...or something like that.

I don't really want a separate 'do not share' flag for every provider we add, and I do not want to stop the recently improved 'share' functionaility.

My thinking is that the 'do not share' will just stop the book being shared in any bulk operation. If you click on 'Send this book to goodreads' or 'Share this book', it will still work.

And it will always be exported via the csv export.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Importing an exported CSV that had new books added in same format does nothing,[],"Before I got my Android tablet I kept track of my hundreds of read books using Excel for each author. Now I have found the amazing ""Book-Catalogue"" app for Android. NOTE: I run the  ""Book-Catalogue"" app for Android direct from my SD card.
     I have converted a few authors of my pre Android reads to csv format as a test. I then exported all the ""Book-Catalogue"" ones read since using ""Book-Catalogue"" and copied the exported header over to my csv file. I then set up my csv file to match the exported version for the author, title,  added a  ""1"" in the read field, added dates in the same format to the read _end field, and left the id field blank.
      I then used the CMD function in DOS to copy both the the exported CSV and my limited csv file  to a new merged file. It looks fine. I did an Excel sort by the author to get them grouped for easier comparison between the old export and my csv file. I also deleted the second header row (from my little csv file).
   Then I renamed the new combined file with the same name as the original exported one and copied it to my Androids SD card in the same folder where the original exported file was (overwriting the previous version). When I remount the SD card & run ""Book-Catalogue"" and do an import the newly added books do NOT show up.
   Where have I gone wrong?

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Anthology checkbox is not saving properly,[],"My issue - actually, it's more of a behavior that does not match the way it should work.  The ""Anthologies Titles"" tab of a book - when you check or uncheck the ""All stories ..."" box and then save the book - the state always reverts to what it was before a change to the check box.  So, by default for any new book added, the default state of the check box is ticked (green checkmark) and if I uncheck it, and then save the book, the check mark reverts to ticked and the green checkmark is still there and will continue to stay there no matter if I save the book or leave the app or anything.  It will just not save the new state of the check box.

By happy chance, I found that I CAN alter its state if I check or uncheck it, but DO NOT save the book, only use the backout key, going back to the bookshelf listing.  I see the listing shiver a bit so I can tell it is updating.  And lo and behold, it has saved the state of the Anthologies titles.  So it is saving when I backout, but not saving when I use save function.  You may want to document it if the fix is too awkward but it has a workaround, so no worries.

It would be nice to be able to search for any given book (this would mean using the Add Book functionality currently) and to see not only the book synopsis but also a list of reviews so that I can decide whether the book is any good and worth buying.

Goodreads, Amazon and Google Books all provide reviews/ratings, so there ought to be sufficient data out there to make this useful. 

Deciding which to use might be more troublesome, but it should be possible to obtain the overall rating info for a given book from the 3 services and present that compactly (average stars & total number of reviews) and then allow the user to select whichever service they prefer (e.g. if it has the most reviews) to be expanded and have the book reviews downloaded while they wait.

One possibility would be to add a field to the database recording who/which phone/etc. added any given record and when (already there I think), which could then be compared with the last sync time to ensure the master record is correct.

Worldcat.org should provide title info for a given ISSN (once extracted from an EAN), though with no date info, this would need to be manually added per scanned item to differentiate between issues.

Realistically I envision adding the records to the backup file on the PC (plus contents info which I'll need to webscrape), but just recognising these numbers would make the resultant data searchable.

I suppose one could potentially add custom plugins per-publication as part of the app to populate contents, but I don't know how complex a plugin infrastructure would be or whether there's enough demand to merit writting the framework.

On a slightly different note, what about music scores? Afair these have their own EAN ""country"" code, are they supported? I don't have any but was just wondering.

If the book is present it could be displayed as per the manual input search, and if not perhaps the user could be given the option to add it to a bookshelf (e.g. I could then add it to a Wishlist bookshelf).

If this were implemented, it would also be useful to perform ""fuzzy"" matching of the book which matches the ISBN - by this I mean that I don't (necessarily) want to buy another copy of a book just because it has a different ISBN (e.g. hardback vs softback, different editions, US vs UK edition, etc.)

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Updating list twice if list activity was destroyed,"[Label(name=""Analysis""), Label(name=""Defect""), Label(name=""On Hold"")]","Odd non-critical error, in need of a solution.

Typical flow is:
- go to list
- select book
- make some changes to book
- save
- returns to list
- onActivityResult is called, and list is regenerated

This is fine. But sometimes we have:
- go to list
- select book
- make some changes to book
- somewhere in here, the list activity is destroyed
- save
- returns to list
- onCreate is called, list is generated
- onActivityResult is called, and list is regenerated

We can certainly tell if onCreate is called because another activity just ended, but we can not tell if onActivityResult is going to be called, and neither can we tell if onActivityResult will request a regen (it does not always require a full regen).

This does not cause any breakage, but it doubles the list regen time unnecessarily.

Thoughts:
1. When we call 'startActivityForResult' we could store a flag indicating a result is pending, then check that flag in onCreate (or perhaps check for pending intents?), but this seems like a very fragile solution.
2. We could possibly store a timestamp in 'results' extras; also record the 'lastRegenTime' in the list, and if the result timestamp is before the 'lastRegen' timestamp, skip the regen. But again this seems fragile.
3. This is not a very critical problem, except that it probably affects the phones that would most benefit from it being solved: older slower ones with less memory.

Open to suggestions!

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Sorting errors for non-numerical series data,"[Label(name=""Defect""), Label(name=""In Beta""), Label(name=""Request"")]","This is alluded to in another thread (https://github.com/eleybourn/Book-Catalogue/issues/233), but I figured it deserves its own mention.  

Book Catalogue doesn't sort by series properly when there are non-numerical characters in the series # field (as is OFTEN the case when retrieving series info automatically from Library Thing). Some examples of books like this are in the other thread. 

As mentioned in the other thread, Library Thing sorts by all characters before the ""|"" symbol and displays only the characters after the ""|"" symbol. Thus these five books of a series would sort like this:

1
2
3
3.1 | Omnibus 1-3   (displaying only ""Omnibus 1-3"")
4

Book Catalogue, however, seems to put everything that's not strictly numerical at the end. So it would sort them like this:
1
2
3
4
3.1 | Omnibus 1-3

I don't care so much about what gets displayed, but the Library Thing sorting method is far superior in my opinion, and should be implemented.

There is one slight thing that bugs me is that when trying to save what bookshelf it is to go to & it's location it will not save the information at the same time. You have to chose your bookshelf & when you save it you are sent back to your booklist. At that point you have to go back into the book & set the location & save it. If you choose your shelf then go to location, set the location of the book & save it under the location page the bookshelf designation is lost. If everything could be saved at one time that would make it perfect.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Merging two authors can cause books to no longer have a 'primary' author or series,"[Label(name=""Defect""), Label(name=""In Beta"")]","Eg. if a book has the following authors:

1: Asimov, I.
2: Asimov, Isaac

and the user edits 'Asimov, I.' to become 'Asimov, Isaac' then we will automatically merge the two authors. Unfortunately when the 'correct' author is the second in the list, this causes the book to end up with the following:

2: Asimov, Isaac

ie. there is no 'primary' author.

The code that does this is CatalogueDBAdapter.globalReplaceAuthor(...) and it needs to have another step added to find all books with _no_ primary author and set the lowest numbered author to be primary (ie. position 1).

Several pieces of code use 'position = 1' as a test, and it would be much slower in SQL to find the lowest numbered author when we build a list.

The same logic also applies to series.

In the case where the CSV file is not in the 'right' place, my suspicion is that we should do the following:
- if the CSV file has a UUID field, copy any image files we find when we copy the details, unless there is a newer file already present
- if the CSV file does not contain a UUID but it DOES contain an ID, AND there is an id-based file, then when the book is added/updated, we should copy/rename the image if there is not a newer version.

The result: those users can not transfer BookCatalogue simply by moving the sdcard.

The question I have is: can anyone see a readon not to rename all image files to match the UUID of the books?

Disadvantages:
1. May be slow upgrade: rename 1000's of files.
2. Creates a bunch of weird 32 character hex names.
3. Not easy to quickly find the file for a book in a CSV file.

Advantages:
1. Merging collections is easy
2. Overwriting files very unlikely
3. Import/export always safe

This has highlighted to me that we do not have any nice way to present errors from large tasks to users. The preliminary 'Events' list from our background tasks is not exactly friendly.

My suggestion is that we add a 'book_events' table. If a book has an associated book_event, then it gets a little yellow exclamation mark in any book list.

The events should be displayable in book details.

Initially, these would include:
- error while exporting to csv  (currently a Toast message)
- error while importing from csv  (currently a Toast message)
- error sending to goodreads
- error updating from <data-source>

This does not handle complete failure to import a book -- but we could have a parentless event and put a clickable excalamation mark in the top of the main window.

Any thoughts?

Edit: more details---

table events(_id, title, description, created_date)

table book_events (book_id, event_id)

Would just purge events older than 1 week (user pref?)

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,open,Handling multiple search providers,"[Label(name=""On Hold""), Label(name=""Wishlist"")]","We currently have:
- google
- amazon
- library thing

and I am adding goodreads.

Searching all 4 concurrently is technically fine, but probably overkill. I am also conscious of the possibility of one or more services disappearing, as well as a user possibly preferrring one site.

As a result, I am considering adding a new 'search provider preferences' activity in which the user can disable some providers and (maybe) choose the preferred order of precedence. Currently we use the precedence: google, amazon, LT....which means we use google data by preference then fill in the blanks from Amazon, and any remaining blanks from LT.

Goodreads will be added before LT because it can search without an ISBN; it also does not seem to unreasonable to me for a user to want goodreads to be the primary source etc.

Which then leads to sources for fields...we currently extract series names from titles at google and amazon, and get series names directly from LT and goodreads.

It _might_ be desirable to say ""I only want series from LT"" or ""I only want series from goodreads"".

Any thoughts?

The question is, how should it work?

This is how I imaging it working:
- start scanner
- scan a book. 
- If ISBN is valid, make a 'good' beep, add it to queue, return to scanner
- if ISBN is bad, make a ""bad"" beep, show a toast message, resume scanning
- when user returns from scanner present them with a list of queued books.

The list will show: 
- if found, ISBN, Cover, Title, Author

Clicking on a 'found' item in list will take them to the add screen
Clicking on a 'not found' item will take them to the ISBN entry screen?

The process really breaks down with the ""not found"" items and with ""misfound"". How do thy know which physical book was the failure? Or worse, which phsyical book corresponds to the incorrectly found ""Mrs Smiths Cookbook for Vegan Dogs""?

This is why I have never been in a hurry to batch scan.  But if anyone out there is passionate about it, now is the time to describe how it whould work!

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Future(current) bug in main view,"[Label(name=""Analysis""), Label(name=""Defect"")]","Experimenting with large collections of books has revealed a limit in SQLite that we are likely to experience.

For each group in an ExpandableListView that is expanded, we return a cursor.

If someone clicks 'Expand All', we return 1 cursor for each group.

If that person has somewhere in excess of 800 (not sure exact number) of groups, SQLite will run out of memory/file descriptors/something.

It seems that ExpandableListView keeps thos cursors open for the entire time.

Couple this with the 'fact' (garnered from google) that the memory requirements of an SQLite cursor are not small, and we probably have a problem in the future, or anyone with a large collection now.

[As an aside, we also have a bug where these cursors are not being closed when the BookCatalogue activity is 'stopped'...only when it is destroyed, resulting in excess cursors being kept in memory until a GC]

As someone with about 337 authors, I always scream when I accidentally click 'Expand All' (I can go make a cup of coffee while I wait for it to complete), I have an interest in this area as well.

I am not entirely sure what the best solution is. Some suggestions come to mind:
1. In terms of returning cursors for sub-lists, my suggestion is that we should maybe return array cursors after extracting the data from the cursor ourselves. This may even be memory efficient. Just an array of Parcelables or Bundles might suffice. The onExpandGroup could refresh it (somehow?). Even if the sublist contained 1000 books, this is going to be considerably less than 1MB since it olny needs to contain some IDs and the text required for the related view.
2. The 'expandAll' option shuld probably be removed, or come with a warning. We may even want to auto-collapse groups when another is expanded.

I'd be very interested in any other ideas!

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Keep resized thumbnails for later use (and store covers in a DB?),"[Label(name=""Defect""), Label(name=""Feature""), Label(name=""In Beta""), Label(name=""Wishlist"")]","I have a selection of cover images ranging in size from 3k to 1.6MB. Scrolling through a list of books with covers displayed can become very sluggish when it hits one of the larger cover images.

I have experimented with creating permanent resized thumbnail versions if the thumbnail size is less than 10% of the original, and it works well: scrolling is smooth once again.

The problem is that my SD Card is formatted as a FAT file system with a minimum allocation of 32k. This means that while my resized thumbnails have a total size of 883 KILO bytes, they actually consume 18 MEGA bytes of storage.

The same is true for all  downloaded covers: a 4k downloaded cover consumes 32k on the sdcard.

So there are three suggestions: 
1. Build thumbnails for covers whhen the thumbnail is less than 10% of the original.
2. Store the new thumbnails in a DB on the sdcard (or wherever cover images are stored). Or perhaps in the main DB since they are quite small.
3. Consider storing all cover images in the tumbnails database (wherever that may be).

If we went with option (3) as well, we might do well to store some extra data with the covers, including a unique ID, and add cover_id to the books tale (to avoid the export/import problem where covers become mismatched). We might also want to record the original source of the file (URL or camera) as well as the image size and format.

I have enjoyed Book-Catalogue a lot. Nevertheless, when I was looking for a book organizer in the Market, I felt attracted at first by other two apps: BooksApp and MyBookDroid.  And the reason was how the opening page of them were organized. It seemed to me easier to deal with the mentioned apps menus, easier to access the shelves, booklists and so on. They were very visual and intuitive. But they both missed some features that turned Book-Catalogue better, like the better databases where book information are found.
So, I suggest, in a positive way, to consider reviewing the Book Catalogue opening/main page. It would be great if the first page showed  the options available: book list, shelves, scan ISBN, etc. Althout Book-Catalogue seemed technically better to me, it is said that the first impression remains, so that is the reason which made feel attracted to some other apps at first. A more friendly opening page would be more captivating.

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,serious issue with dates in export.csv,"[Label(name=""Defect"")]","I just noticed this. I think it's a recent bug, but it's possible it's an older bug I just now noticed:  many of my books do not get their dates exported to the export.csv file. That is, the date shows up when I look at the book in Book Catalogue, but there's just an empty date field in export.csv. 

That's obviously an extremely serious issue because if I go to manually edit some data in export.csv on my computer, when I reimport the data into Book Catalogue, I will lose all of those dates. (I assume this is the case, anyway. Maybe it's not so, but I'm afraid to test it out.. Can anyone say whether a blank date field in the csv file will overwrite the existing date in an existing record as a blank?).

I've noticed, however, that if I go to one of the books whose date is not exporting (in Book Catalogue), click on the date field, then ""set"", then ""save book"", then the next time I export the catalog, the date _does_ show up in the csv file. But I'm not going to do that for hundreds of books.

Two examples of this so you can see what I’m talking about are: Three Hearts and Three Lions, by Poul Anderson, ISBN 9780441808229, the 2nd image present (5th image slot); Ogre, Ogre, by Piers Anthony, ISBN 9780345354921, 1st (only) image present (4th slot).

b) When I go to add/replace a thumbnail cover “from other editions”, sometimes it displays an “!” in the image slots even when an actual cover exists (i.e. when a thumbnail image should be displayed).

eleybourn/Book-Catalogue,closed,Non-numerical info in series field -- should be allowed,"[Label(name=""In Beta""), Label(name=""Request""), Label(name=""Wishlist"")]","When entering in series info for a book, it should allow non-numerical keys to be used if desired. Non-numerical info gets often added automatically with a lot of the books I enter via ISBN, and I should be able to create my own non-numerical info for books I have to enter manually. 

Here are some specific cases where the non-numerical series info got entered for me automatically; I will hypothesize about why whoever it was entered the series info that way.

---

Book info: Anthony, Piers;  Battle Circle; ISBN 9780380018000

Series_details field: “Battle Circle (100\|Omnibus 1-3)”  (shows up as ""100|Omnibus 1-3"")

Reason: In this case, the book is a complete series by itself. I suppose the series info is entered that way so that if you have any of the individual series books, too, this one will show up after them.

---

Book info: Cook, Glen; Silver Spike, The; ISBN 9780812502206

Series_details field: “Chronicles of the Black Company (3.5\|spin-off)”  (shows up as ""3.5|spin-off"")

Reason: This book is sort of part of the Chronicles of the Black Company, but not really. It’s in the same universe and tangentially deals with the main characters. Chronologically it falls between books 3 and 4. Therefore whoever entered the series info listed it as 3.5, but then used some text to write “spin-off” as an explanation.

---

Book info: Karpyshyn, Drew; Path of Destruction; ISBN 9780345477375

Series_details field: “Star Wars (0.010030\|1003-1000 BBY)”  (shows up as “0.010030|1003-1000 BBY”)

Reason: The Star Wars books are sorted by chronological order (in addition to series order), with the chronology being set by DATES, rather than numbers. That way when someone writes a new Star Wars book, one just has to enter in the date the book takes place, and not re-shuffle the chronological info for all of the other books. The dates are given in a “BC” or “AD” kind of fashion, using the codes “BBY” and “ABY”. Thus one must enter text to properly record the date of the book.

---

In addition to letters, all three of those used the symbol “|”. And two used hyphens. None of that is allowed by Book Catalogue.

I have added couple things to your book catalogue-program. I don't want to do

There is 2 main things; add additional field (for barcode/isbn) and searching
with barcode. Currently scanning functionality is in own file, but I should be
merged with existing scan (bookisbnsearch). Some books I have, have different
number is it's barcode than what actually is it's ISBN-number. Also some books
have also second barcode (product-code?).

Searching with barcode is quite simple addition, but it could be combined (and
 also expand functionality) with ""Add by Barcode"". I added a small patch to

I can't put my finger on it, yet , but it might have something to do when entering a wrong ISBN number. Your program reports that it can't find the book. You press 'return' and use the option 'add via ISBN' again to add the corrected ISBN number.

yes mate, this does ""duplicate"" 95 - closed it without realising what I was doing! Half asleep! Sorry.

Having upgraded my HTC Desire to include the recent patch to implement Flash Player, any attempt to search for a book results in Book Catalogue hanging - either when the ISBN is scanned or when it is typed in. May be coincidental to the HTC upgrade, may be a clash with other s/ware, Just noticed it today, having upgraded the kernel.

I can still enter books manually - just don't try to retieve from the internet.

I thought at first that the problem was that Advanced Task Killer was killing off parts of the app - turns out that even with ATK uninstalled, the problem returns.

I've now tried scanning a brand new book, and it has given me the message ""ISBN Scanned. Searching Internet"" after being left for about three to four minutes. After another minute or two, the screen responds, filled in.

Am I missing the obvious? Is it just that Amazon in running REALLY slow?

Having said that, it runs perfectly when the handset starts up, then slows dramatically within about 30 seconds to this ""snail's pace"", so I still do think it is something to do with the OS or the app in combination with something else.
