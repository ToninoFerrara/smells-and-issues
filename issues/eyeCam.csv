tom-and-jerry/eyeCam,closed,Flashlight support not working correctly,[],"- start app, switch on flash, exit app (home button, not back), open app again -> menu indicates flash is on which it isnt (probably also shouldnt but menu should also indicate of)

tom-and-jerry/eyeCam,open,Take light conditions and saturation into account for color recognition,[],"Problem of perception:
Colours from lights are different from reflected colours i.e. red lights look more orange, red ink looks more brown.

Saturation:
whiteboard and pens (black, red & green). brand new pens (i.e. lots of ink) look black. Half way through their life, they look like their colours – red is red, green is green. As they run out of ink, black is hard to see while red and green disappear

tom-and-jerry/eyeCam,closed,[FEATURE] redesign user interface,[],"In order to facilitate the user interface, the menu button will be removed and the filter selection will be a two filter switch.

tom-and-jerry/eyeCam,closed,[ISSUE] scale Camera preview to fill the whole screen,[],"On the HTC EVO 3D the app seems to work other then the camera ""feed"" does not fill the whole screen.

There should be an upper bound to the maximal resolution.
"
tom-and-jerry/eyeCam,closed,[BUG] preview size of camera sometimes is too small,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","This is because we test for the optimal screen size using the aspect ratio of the screen. If the camera does not support the exact screen size as a preview size this approach might fail (e.g. Samsung Galaxy nexus where the optimal screen size gets chosen as 128x96).

A better approach would be to choose the preview size as the smallest size spanning the whole screen.
"
tom-and-jerry/eyeCam,closed,[BUG] light button not showing correct state,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","when having light on, stoping preview through color recognition, the light button shows LED being active when its not.

The Activity (acting as the model) should update the StateImageButton (acting as the view) according to the action supplied by the StateImageButton (acting as the controller) in order to prevent such inconsistencies.
