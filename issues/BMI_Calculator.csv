zikalify/BMI_Calculator,closed,Fix building issues,[],"Those changes fix BMI Calculator compilation from the command line (this case includes F-Droid build server):

    gradle assembleRelease

Also note that before making a new release you need to bump `versionCode`, not only `versionName`. Otherwise Android considers new build the same as old one and will not upgrade it."

I suspect that you did not authorize this developer to publish your work under their name, especially in violation of the GPLv3 as no link to the source code is provided. This developer did the same with another of my applications.

If you are interested, you may choose to ask Google to take down this application, if that is your wish.
