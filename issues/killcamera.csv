aario/killcamera,open,Also Kill mediaserver?,[],"To be clear about the problem I'm trying to remedy: If any imaging app (camera, scanner, magnifier, etc) crashes, then only an OS reboot 'releases' the camera for further use;  otherwise, no image + error message.

This app doesn't seem to work for me - but I really want it to work. (Yes, it has explicit root privileges.)

However, I discovered that killing ""/system/bin/mediaserver"" remedies the problem, without fail. The process then promptly restarts itself, and all is good again. Searching a bit, I found others landing on the same fix.

I see that you're killing any process name containing ""camera"". Assuming that your app was, indeed, intended to remedy this very issue, would you be willing to also parse-for and kill/reset ""mediaserver "", as well as ""camera""?
