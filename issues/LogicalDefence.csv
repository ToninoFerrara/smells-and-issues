LukeStonehm/LogicalDefence,closed,Appeal to Authority seems false,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The explanation given for appeal to authority isn't proper.

This should be the correct definition:

""An Appeal to Authority is a fallacy with the following form: Person A is (claimed to be) an authority on subject S. Person A makes claim C about subject S. Therefore, C is true.""

Therefore, if a professor in economics or a minister of finance claims ""x"" to be a reasonable economic policy, it should not be taken as reasonable. Only the argument should be looked at. The same thing applies to scientific papers. It does not matter that if a scientist revealed it or if a highly prestigious university revealed it. All that should matter is the reasons behind it, even if a a beggar porposed a theory, which is reasonable, it should be then accepted, as it is reasonable. Authority has nothing to do with reason, and that's what ""appeal to authority"" tries to state.

The definition given in the app is : ""Claiming something is true because an (unqualified or untrustworthy) 'expert"" says it is.""

Even a qualified and trustworthy expert can have fallacious reasoning. The ""unqualified and ""untrustworthy"" clause should be replaced with ""a person holding authority"" or something.
