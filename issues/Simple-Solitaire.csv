TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire,open,[Bug] in Forty&Eight,[],"From an e-mail I received:

> I have noticed a bug in the game called Forty&Eight. Sometimes when trying to resume a game after the app has been closed it will deal another four rows of cards on top of what remains from the previous session. These new cards are dealt ""face down"" so I cannot see their values. I can play cards onto them. Of course the game is ruined by this bug and must be restarted. The bug is reproducible, but I am not certain of the cause. It has occurred several times, but not every time I resume a previously interrupted game."
TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire,open,[Question] How can a game remove a card?,[],"I'm trying to implement [Maze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_(solitaire)), which deals all 52 cards then removes the kings from play entirely. I tried calling `Card.removeFromCurrentStack()` on the kings, but that didn't seem to update the display of the game, and the game crashes when I try to move one of the kings that shouldn't even be there. It looks like none of the `SharedData.moveToStack` methods are meant to be called with a null destination stack. Is there some other way to remove a card from a stack without moving it to another stack?"
TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire,closed,Increase played games counter after first movement,[],"Hello,

I see in the code that (presumably) in the past the game counter was updated only after the first movement:

````

         //   incrementPlayedGames();
            movedFirstCard = true;

Which makes more sense than the current behavior of increasing the counter after dealing regardless of if the game was actually played.

TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire,open,Klondike options,[],"Hi,

I am playing klondike a lot :-) and noticed several things which each may be a separate request and of which they might apply to other solitaire games.

- Empty spots are only fillable by a king, something which in some games leads to an unwinnable situation. And a rule which was allowed when I learned it years ago.
- Total hiding of scoring, because I play the game for fun so even hinting at statistics activates my wanting to win mode, instead of simple relaxation
- Already seen a similar issue: implementarion of a heuristic/algorithm to only generate winnable games. To shift impact this list could be generated during compilation as a hash table. New game would compare the generated game with the lookup table and try again if it is not in that that winnable game list.

These items can be parameterized to not break other peoples experience of course

Thank you for creating this pleasant distraction! It's nice to play something more than just solitaire after so many years. The layout of the game looks neat, too.

I have noticed, that in Forty&Eight it is not always possible to move several cards in a correct sequence at once, even though the game rules allow it and there are free places in the foundation.

I notice that you override callback function `onAttach(Context)` in class [`CustomPreferenceFragment`](https://github.com/TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire/blob/a761ecb0ca3df9dea1b5bb6f8bea7e50f51a2ab1/app/src/main/java/de/tobiasbielefeld/solitaire/classes/CustomPreferenceFragment.java).

To test this issue, when `CustomPreferenceFragment` starts, function `reinitializeData(context)` written in `onAttach(Context)` runs normally in Android 6.0, but this function does not execute in Android 5.1 or earlier devices, meaning that if the app got killed within the `PreferenceFragment` and restarted, the data will not be reinitialized.

I think the problem comes from this check: `stacks[originIDs[0]].getSize() != 1` at https://github.com/TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/tobiasbielefeld/solitaire/games/Freecell.java#L271 .

I understand that a complete check could be very heavyweight, but I'd appreciate at least some basic checks, starting from the obvious base case where no move is possible from the very beginning - yes it happens - and perhaps checking that after 1, 2, ...N moves (for small values of N, otherwise the possibilities explode) the game doesn't reach an unsolvable state. That would already be a step forward.

Another option could be to modify the board generation algorithm to ensure it generates solvable games (perhaps starting from a solved game, then scrambling the cards ""backwards"" so we're sure that the initial state that is presented to the user can lead to a solved game).

Way too many times, cards are grouped on the stack, in a non-random order.  For example, cycling through the stack one card at a time, I'll commonly get a BK, RQ, BJ, R10, etc.. in order.  This occurs from the main stack as well as on the lower stacks when turning them over.   Looking into it (I'm not at a place I can compile and test changes myself), it appears that the randomize(Card[] array) function isn't using any kind of seed when randomizing cards.  I realize it's a PRNG, but when receiving things like 4 aces on initial deal, or cards in order for use, it takes away enjoyment from the game.  I really do like it, but sometimes I can nearly clear the board before flipping my first card to the discard stack.

I found [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=startandroid.ru.solitairepack) on the Google Play Store. This guy just took your source code and put it on the Store, without warning this is free/libre software...

As you are the owner of the source code, feel free to open a request to google [here](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_dmca?product=googleplay) to remove this false app from the Store, if it's your wish ;)

Don't forget to tell Google that:

* The app is licensed under GNU GPL v3 license and this guy is violating it;
* He is falsely claiming he made the app.

Maybe add a link to this repo in the request, some screenshots of your original app..."
TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire,closed,Two cards removed,[],"When for example in Pyramid, say two 4 lie next to each other and you move a 9 to them, and if your aiming is bad so you touch both 4, both of them will vanish. 
I don't know much about the other games, just playing the ones I know 😀, but I think it would be in any game where you have to move one card to another. 
Although I don't have any experience with Android programming, I think you will have to calculate how much of one card lies on the other one and just remove the card with the higher part. 

You may answer in English or German ☺️"
TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Solitaire,closed,Feature Request: Game rules accessible from game ,[],"Hi there !

I've been using your app for some time now, and I really enjoy it, thanks! Mostly, I'm discovering new solitaires with your included rules. The only issue I have is that I need 7 clicks to go from a solitaire to its rules (back to home screen, into the manual, games rules, and finally click on the right rule). This is painful. Could a shortcut to a game's rules be included straight in the playing screen, please?

Many thanks!

Hitting undo and redoing the last move a few times (or splitting the last merge into a couple of additional moves) seems to eventually cause the game to end properly, which makes me think it's something timing-related?

I mostly play Spider and Klondike; I don't see this behavior with Klondike, but I usually auto-complete Klondike (which isn't an option with Spider), so perhaps it's related?

it reminsds me realy much at kPatience (same end animation and card art). I like the handling very much. but there is one thing i am missing: i have seen that the app woekes geate in portrait and in landscape mode, but normaly my device is fixed to portrait mode so that i have to switch to landscape orientation if i want to enyoj the app best. So i would be very happy if you could add an orientation setting where you can select defaulr (as of the android system suggests), fixed landscape, fixed portrait ans landscape upside down mode. thanks in advance. and also i am happy to see more Patience's (like frecell, spider and yukon) in the future.

thanks and keep up the good work"
