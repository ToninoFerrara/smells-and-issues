I hope someone will take it over and keep developing it.

Case
Sometimes I have to round my hours on different tasks up and down to the nearest quarter hour. Having a daily sum total would let me check that the daily sum is correct after my rounding.

RFE
The number could sit next to the day of the week in the 'By Week' view."

ambrice/timesheet,open,Cannot get past welcome screen,[],"I just installed Timesheet through f-droid. When executing it I get the ""Welcome to Timesheet!"" screen, but can't get past that.

My phone (an OnePlus 2) doesn't have the ""menu"" hardware button, which I suspect is what I'm missing to start using the app.

ambrice/timesheet,closed,Alphabetise task lists,[],"Hi,

Nice app; simple, tidy, and although I'm not a freelancer but am just using it to track my daily time generally I've found it to do the job nicely.

Would you like to have the task list sorted so some users can find a task a little easier than when they added it?

I've added a preference and used it when fetching all tasks from the db, both in the main view and the time edit selector. The only gotcha is that it needs the list / app to be closed and re-opened, but I don't think users would change it all that often for it to become a nuisance.

Below is a few screenshots of:
- the bilable>title sorted list and in the time edit screen
- the preference enabled & disabled
- the billable>id sorted list (i.e. original functionality)
