"
chemicalappspace/Isotopes,open,Large isotope lists overflow screen,[],"As the title implies- I'm looking at Au, for example, which only displays <sup>169</sup>Au to <sup>191</sup>Au.  Rotating the screen cuts this off to <sup>179</sup>Au with a small portion of the next line's characters.  Perhaps a scrollbar can be implemented?

Cheers
