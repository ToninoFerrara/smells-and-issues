markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Render (possibly gl_FragCoord.y?) issue in portrait mode on 1/1 quality,[],"Hi, thank you for putting this app out there!

I installed the version 2.12.0 recently on a new phone (Huawei P10 Lite running Android 7.0). I've noticed a very specific glitch under particular circumstances.

## Expected Behaviour
When quality is set to ""1/1"" and the orientation is in portrait mode, a shader program should render correctly.

## Actual Behaviour
The resulting render is glitched in a very specific way. It appears to be rendering using the value of only the bottom row of pixels. It seems as if the value of `gl_FragCoord.y` specifically does not change.

## Conditions to reproduce
This only ever seems to happen when quality is set to ""1/1"" and the screen is in portrait mode. When in landscape mode on ""1/1"" quality, the shader program renders as expected. Setting quality to any other level allows the shader program to render correctly regardless of orientation.

## Observations
This is quite an unfortunate bug seeing as ""1/1"" is the default quality level. I am curious as to whether anybody else has encountered this issue, and if so their phone model and android version. I hope it is not just a weird issue with my phone.

I had a quick look into the codebase and saw a great deal of references to `quality` in `ShaderRenderer.java`, and might have a deeper look into it when I have more time. Do you have any idea of what the underlying cause might be?

You can see this by loading up the Gravity Vector preset. When the device is in a portrait configuration, the screen corresponds to the device orientation quite nicely, but when the device switches to landscape configuration, the motion on the screen stops making sense.

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,open,Suggestion — New uniform: persistent runtime timer,[],"USE CASE:  Jane wrote a new shader that changes visibly with time, but in a slow and smooth manner based on one of the existing timer uniforms.
She then decided to set her shader as a home/lockscreen wallpaper.
The shader worked fine, but when she opened an app and later returned to the home screen, there was a discontinuity in the time uniform, between the time she left and then returned to the home screen.

This might've been easy to overlook, if not for one detail: the _system cached an image of the last frame of the wallpaper as it left the home screen and displayed momentarily (a split second) before starting the shader again._

This caused the screen to visibly flicker from the cached image to a freshly rendered image, causing discomfort due to the jarring change.

Proposed way to fix it: a persistent timer uniform that stops when the shader isn't running.

Things to consider:
- A system-dependent offset may need to be applied to a persisted value upon loading, to compensate system idiosyncrasies.
- Precision issues if the uniform is to be a floating point number (in cases when it runs for too long).
- Some people may want a version that oscillates between two numbers; others might prefer one that grows up to a maximum and then resets back to a starting value.
- Different contexts should have different timers; hacking around in the shader code editor shouldn't change the state of the timer used for wallpapers.

Alternatively/additionally: persist the last frame of the last shader that ran as a wallpaper and provide it as an uniform so it can be used in a fading animation.

It has been implemented on shadertoy.com:

> 03/01/2016 - Release 0.8
> - Multipass rendering is here! Intermediate render targets are 16 bit (which means no hacky pack/unpack operations)
>   Hello proper Depth of Field, SSAO, Motion Blur, HDR, gamma control, incremental monte carlo rendering, games...

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,open,Rendering to file,[],"It would be a nice feature to render the shader output to a file (only an image, or even a video).
It is possible to capture the output with screenshot or screen recording but with low-fps shaders the video will be lagging.
"
markusfisch/ShaderEditor,open,Minor identation annoyance,[],"I noticed a minor annoyance with the indenting code. The easiest way to reproduce the issue, is to delete all the code in a new shader and then type in:

```
void main( void ) {
float r = 0.2;
}
```

When typing the above code, the code indentation becomes:

```
void main( void ) {
  float r = 0.2;
  }
```

Instead of:

```
void main( void ) {
  float r = 0.2;
}
```

I had a look with the debugger https://github.com/markusfisch/ShaderEditor/blob/master/ShaderEditor/src/main/java/de/markusfisch/android/shadereditor/widget/ShaderEditor.java but couldn't really understand what was going on.

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Add a random uniform that changes every time the shader loads,[],"Hello, I'd like to make the shader look different every time it loads. Would It be possible to add some uniform that gets randomized at the load of the shader and then stays constant? It would help me a lot, thanks!

I don't know if there is a specific area for feature request. So I'm posting here, sorry if it is on the wrong place.

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Discard is not working properly,[],"According to the the OpenGL ES 1.00 specification the discard keyword will not update the buffer if called. Thus it should contain the last written pixel value in the buffer until overwritten.
In the ShaderEditor discard will cause the (not) written pixel to be black. I think this is caused by the clear command at the start of rendering. It would be nice to make use of the discard keyword!

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,"Added texture input from bitmap,  and saveShader in onPause.",[],"Hi, I wanted to experiment with iq's bitmap-derived noise from shadertoy.com, so I added texture input. 

It's not really ready to just include as It currently reads from a hard coded path on the sd card and dies spectacularly if the file is missing. I also added a call to saveShader in MainActivity.onPause() because I kept losing my work after rotating or pressing the back button.

Feel free to use or ignore, thought I should at least share it with you :)

Oh, I should note that I haven't been able to get the noise working without artifacts, not sure why.

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Slow shaders,[],"Hello.

Thanks for this app. I'm having too much fun with it. 

I notice that when I make a ""heavy"" shader with low fps, the UI slows down to a point of become unusable. Shouldn't the rendering side be separated of the UI side, option menu, spinner etc ? I mean, is there a way to play with low fps shaders and still have an usable UI ? 

Thanks

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Time uniform accuracy.,[],"Shouldn't time be an integer value? Float values have problems with accuracy after some time, specially 32 bit floats. I know that most times the effect is only visible for a few seconds and accuracy shouldn't be an issue, but this kind of wallpapers are used to show off, so it would be a good idea to make them work fine even if they are active more than a few seconds. Some effects i've tested (like this one: http://glslsandbox.com/e#26016.0) begin to show problems after 20 seconds or so... The problem is the accuracy, not the frame rate. The FPS meter shows the same FPS before and after the problems are noticeable.

Maybe it would be a better idea to add a ""frame count"" uniform.

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Live wallpaper: framerate drops over time,[],"This is a behavior I've noticed on my Nexus 6, even when the phone is plugged in: the framerate of the live wallpaper reduces every 15 seconds or so, by about half each time. The framerate of the UI itself is not affected.
"
markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Multitouch,[],"It would be cool if `touch` were changed to be an array of (up to 10)? touches on-screen, for recognizing multi-touch. Each touch could be a `vec2`, with touches that aren't down set to `(-1, -1)`.

(I had some crazier ideas about representing touch state, including the `vec3` pattern Shadertoy uses for mouse input where `z` acts as an up/down boolean, but ultimately the best ideas I had were just awkward gestures at an incomplete persistence model.)

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Docs / examples for all exposed inputs,[],"It would be useful if there were either documentation of the names and values of the inputs to shaders in the README, or a shader/shaders that used them out-of-the-box (or, ideally, both).

I guess they're implemented somewhere around [here](https://github.com/markusfisch/ShaderEditor/blob/master/src/de/markusfisch/android/shadereditor/ShaderRenderer.java#L327-350)?

This is an awesome app, BTW - basically an open-source Android alternative to [Shaderific](http://www.shaderific.com/). Found it through F-Droid. I'm becoming obsessed with creating shader-based wallpapers for my new Nexus 6.
"
markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Exposing shader scripts in the filesystem?,[],"This app looks pretty neat, but the lack of an easy way to manipulate and externally edit the shaders it uses is something of a dealbreaker. (On top of not being able to import a file I've typed up on my PC, it's kind of hard to develop shaders when I'm not even able to name them.)

What I'd like to see is an option somewhere in the UI to set a directory to use for shader files. This would let me do any fancy file importing / exporting / naming / versioning etc. using any file browser (along with other stuff like a Git client and/or an external text editor), while still making the elements of the UI such as the dropdown as usable as they currently are.

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,still the backbuffer,[],"Hi again!

I tried some little code out that uses the backbuffer and the result image started ""swimming"" away to the top right direction. So I tried to compensate the movement by adding values to the 2nd parameter of texture2D. It seems the value of +vec2(0.001) solved this.
I hope I'm using the function correctly, by writing:
texture2D(backbuffer,gl_FragCoord.xy/resolution.xy+vec2(0.001))

markusfisch/ShaderEditor,closed,Unable to open the menu,[],"I love this application but it has two major flaws and a minor flaw that make using it difficult. 

First, after I updated my phone to Android Lolipop I lost the ability to open the menu. I can still switch between shaders, but holding down the selector no longer opens the menu. This is not a bug in your application, but severely limits the application's usefulness in my case. I would like to see a more intuitive and universal menu activation, such as a sliding drawer from the left.

Second, the inability to disable the live preview from the text editor causes issues when editing bright, noisy, or slow shaders. I would like an option to disable live preview, please.

Finally, the text editor makes editing long lines of code difficult as touching nearby shorter lines scrolls back to the left side. I'm not sure if improving this experience is within your ability, but I thought I'd mention it away.

I wrote about my inability to open the menu in an app review, but I realized you did not check there regularly. I created this account to thank you for making this awesome app and request a few changes. Thank you.
