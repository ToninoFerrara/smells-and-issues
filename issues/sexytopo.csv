However text point entries in drawings is not exported to Therion format.  Not sure how this would be done, as I assume there is no direct equivalent in xvi format (I don't know).  The text entity could be parsed direct to a scrap (with point label) in the Therion th2 file, but this would be a bit messy.  Firstly all the labels would be in one arbitrary scrap, which may have no relation to the way the survey/drawing author wants to set things out, and it may confuse inexperienced Therion users.
But mainly I don't like the 'raw survey notes in scrap' idea because it blurs the line between survey notes and subsequent drawing or data edits (which is one reason why I believe TopoDROID is flawed). The ideal would be to export the ST drawing text entities into xvi format and have it parse to Therion (and other export formats)."

Currently you have the cross section as perpendicular to the last leg. If it is a station with a single leg, that is the only real automatic option. However. when there are 2 legs, the most common definition and the one that gets it right most often is the perpendicular bisector of the legs. This is what pockettopo, Therion and I believe Survex all use, so it would make sense to use the same as the programme they are likely to be exported to.

I really like the lines showing where the cross sections are, a real nifty feature would be to allow the user to set the direction. Guess some thought would have to be put into how the direction is exported, but I and others have used the direction you are facing in bracket after the station number, when doing this on paper surveying, so maybe this could be adapted"

Currently you can reverse a leg from the plot screens, although this is a good place, it is often easier to do it in the data screen, would it be possible to add this as an option, please?

Also instead of having to pick select mode, could a context menu not be brought up with a long click on move mode? This would make it far easier for the user."
richsmith/sexytopo,closed,Incorrect way to reverse a leg,[],"As stated previously a survey program should record what a survey actual does.

So if a person reads a backwards leg it should be recorded as a backwards leg eg

5    4    10.34    115    +11

However Sexytopo is just changing the measurements and recording

4   5    10.34    295    -11

This causes 2 problems
If you do not know where the station was read from, you might not be able to go back and check for thinks like magnetic interference or know that it was taken away from the interference, something like a anchor in the wall.
It breaks clino calibration, lets take an extreme example, but one I have seen.

On the above data, if the Clino was reading 4 degrees (something I have seen) under the true reading when the survey program corrects the reading it will then use

5    4    10.34    115    +15 (+11+4)

4   5    10.34    295    -7 ((-11+4)

So the way SexyTopo records the data doubles the error for reversed legs when clino correction is applied. 

There are probably lots of other reasons not to change the readings, but the above are the main 2.

Oh and I have just noticed, it does not actually change the sign of the clino reading, so the reversal of a leg is actually wrong, so the elevation plot becomes wrong"

This should not happen, as it is also possible to take 1 reading and make it into a leg, it is important to be able to distinguish the difference, is it is likely that the multiple reading leg is less likely a blunder than the single reading, survex is in the process of taking account of this, I believe.
It is also important as at times, say for avens, the user might have overriden a set of legs that did not become a leg automatically, these are more varied and by just having the export, this cannot be ascertained.
The DistoX also records its rotation when taking a reading, this would be useful to be stored, as a leg with 3 readings with the same orientation is not as likely to be correct as a leg with at least 2 orientations. (I wonder if this should be a different issue)"

richsmith/sexytopo,open,Native File Format,[],"> Sexytopo doesn't really have a format per se for sketches - it just holds the data in memory as native Android objects and saves it as .json.

With regard to SexyTopo's native save/load format:

Currently survey data is persisted and read in an extremely basic Survex-compatible format. It uses the Survex .svx extension, and consists of absolutely nothing except the raw survey data in Survex default ""data normal"" format.

```
1   2   3.77    299.23  18.23
2   -   5.00    0.00    0.00
2   3   10.00   90.00   0.00
3   4   15.00   180.00  45.00
```

I've got a local branch which implements magnetic declination calculation and correction. This requires persisting and loading the declination value associated with a given survey.

Additionally, there will be more metadata associated with a given survey as the software grows. Examples include the name of the cave, the survey date, perhaps the survey team, etc.

I have implemented a slightly more thorough Survex export/import based upon the following format:

```
*title TestSurvey
*date 2016.01.21
*declination 14.48 degrees

1   2   3.77    299.23  18.23
2   -   5.00    0.00    0.00
2   3   10.00   90.00   0.00
3   4   15.00   180.00  45.00
```

The parser makes it easy to add support for new Survex commands as features warrant them.

The real question, however, is whether a subset of the Survex format is _desired_ as the native SexyTopo format, or whether a SexyTopo-specific format is preferred. My opinion is that the world doesn't need Yet Another Cave Survey Format, and I do like the Survex format (as well as the similar but changed-for-absolutely-no-reason Therion centerline version) but the decision isn't mine to make.

This PR replaces all incorrect usages of ""declination"" with ""azimuth"", so that there will be no confusion when magnetic declination correction is added in the future.

Note that the internal API most frequently uses the term ""bearing"" to refer to compass measurement. PocketTopo now uses the term ""azimuth"" in its UI. And ""azimuth"" is the correct term for a 0 - 360-deg measurement, while ""bearing"" more correctly refers to quadrant + 0 - 90-deg measurement (eg. W70-deg) [see: https://engineering.purdue.edu/~asm215/topics/bearings.html].
