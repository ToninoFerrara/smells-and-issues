graham22/Classic,open,PVOutput Upload,[],"Hi there,

First I'd like to say great work on the app, it's been fantastic for me. I have a classic 150 with 500 watts of panels and I wanted to see how things look on PVOutput.org.

Yesterday I created my account and set the app up with the API key and Site ID, but I'm not seeing any outputs recorded on the site. I also tried generating another API key last night, still nothing.

Is there any way to check a log or something to see what's happening?

Thanks!
