gwhiteside/abstract-art,open,License for the sprites / Possible copyright infringement,[],"Hi,
I am quite surprised to see your app using what appears to be Earthbound sprites right from the game.
Do you have permission to redistribute these? If so, are they under a free license?

Best regards,

gwhiteside/abstract-art,open,App isn't shown anywhere on phone,[],"So I've downloaded the app and realized not only is the open button (that should be next to the uninstall button in the appstorr) is gone, but also that I can not find it ad an app or widget on the phone. Tried finding it through file manager but nothing please hell. Running on Samsung SM galaxy 3

gwhiteside/abstract-art,open,enemy sprites broken,[],"On the Nvidia Shield Tablet, the sprites for all the enemy images are scrambled or missing.  Other than that, awesome app!

gwhiteside/abstract-art,open,SÃ©lect Background crashes the LWP,[],"Hi.

Using this on a Nexus 4 works fine, unless I try to select backgrounds. Selecting the background menu in the settings, or setting the double tap behavior then double tap on the LWP totally crashes it.

gwhiteside/abstract-art,open,Default framecap value not applied on Android 4.1,[],"I just upgraded my Skyrocket to Cyanogenmod 10 and the initial framerate is uncapped. Going into the settings and opening/closing the frame limiter option screen sets the default to 60fps, however.

I believe it set the default value automatically when I was testing Cyanogenmod 7 and 9, and the two most recent Samsung stock ROMs. More Android settings framework headaches, ugh.

gwhiteside/abstract-art,closed,Broken on Android 4.x,[],"After finally receiving the Android 4.0.4 upgrade for my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, Abstract Art doesn't operate correctly. Backgrounds display and the color cycling shader functions, but the scrolling runs super-fast, the wavy distortions aren't happening, and the enemies aren't showing up. With no other devices to test on I have to assume it's broken for Android 4.x. On the bright side, these are some of the issues other people reported in earlier Android versions that I couldn't reproduce, so this could be a great opportunity to figure out what's going wrong and fix it.

gwhiteside/abstract-art,closed,Color cycling effects don't work on several phones,[],"The shader code that colorizes indexed color images on-the-fly doesn't seem to work on a few phones, instead producing a black texture.

Phones known to be affected:
Samsung Galaxy S
Motorola Droid X

Phones known to work:
Samsung Galaxy S II

gwhiteside/abstract-art,closed,dynamic shader compiler doesn't support switching distortions,[],"The dynamic shader code cuts down the fragment cycles by around 50%, but it only supports one type of distortion and palette cycle effect at a time. I either need to prepare several shaders in advance and just switch them when necessary, or add a fair deal of the branching code back in. The multiple shaders approach would probably run more efficiently, but I'd be concerned about the risk of effects desynchronizing between two layers (assuming they were specifically synchronized). It could be avoided with forethought, but it's the kind of thing that could at some point cause subtle runtime bugs that would take forever to track down. I'll have to figure out which way I'd like to go with that.

gwhiteside/abstract-art,closed,overscan area shouldn't be rendered,[],"Rows 224 - 255 wouldn't be visible normally, so they should just be discarded and the remaining image scaled up to fill the space.

gwhiteside/abstract-art,closed,palette rotation is incomplete,[],"There are aspects to the palette rotation modes that I haven't uncovered yet.
"
gwhiteside/abstract-art,closed,layer 305 animates incorrectly,[],"The background appears to jump around several times during each of the texture scrolling sequences. It could be a scrolling or distortion issue.
