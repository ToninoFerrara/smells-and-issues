xbmc/Kore,open,add addon search,[],"This pr adds a generic search function that should work for every addon that has a search function.

The current behavior of the search buttons in the addons view is nothing but a socket timeout and a not responding app during everlasting reconnections when using tcp connection.

The problem with the addon search is that it is actualy a `GetDirectory` request. But to obtain search results a text input have to be done. To do so you have to send the search string to the backend. But because of `Socket.getOutputStream()` blocks a request for sending until the response of the previous request is received the search string is sent via http as workaround (to overcome this nio channels could be used in the future).

There is also a fallback implementation to prevent socket timeouts and possible reconnection difficulties. This fallback sends a dummy string to the backend to force the response of the search request. The ugly thing is that this dummy string shows up in the addon history."

xbmc/Kore,open,Cannot create new connection to kodi on Libreelec,[],"Hi

When I try to create new connection to Libreelec box (8.2.5, with kodi 17.6) from kore (v 2.4.4), and click ""Test"" button, I get ""Can't connect to Kodi/XBMC. Please check configuration"" message and the host is not added.
I tested same configuration (ip, port, username and password) with yatse on same device and it works, so I think it's not a network or kodi configuration problem. Indeed, I can ping kodi host from android device, telnet to port 80 and 9090 works (can establish connection).

When seeking in Kodi, the progressbars in Kore are not synchronised. Although the Player.OnSeek notifications are captured in kore, they are not passed to the HostConnectionObserver.PlayerEventsObserver.

1. I extended the PlayerEventObserver interface with the method:
https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/105b12b0ae9e668f2bf89701b497436c12723800/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/host/HostConnectionObserver.java#L106-L111

2. I passed the OnSeek notification in the HostConnectionObserver class:
https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/105b12b0ae9e668f2bf89701b497436c12723800/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/host/HostConnectionObserver.java#L412-L420

3. This enables the classes BaseMediaActivity and NowPlayingFragment to update the progressbars:
https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/105b12b0ae9e668f2bf89701b497436c12723800/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/BaseMediaActivity.java#L321-L324 https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/105b12b0ae9e668f2bf89701b497436c12723800/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/sections/remote/NowPlayingFragment.java#L588-L591


Not sure why this was not implemented though, probably a good reason I'm not aware of.

Many classes impliment the PlayerEventObserver interface where the onSeek notification is not used so maybe this should be done in a different way. I initially wanted to know the exact progress to mimic additive skipping (as an option which could be enabled in the settings)."

I added three dots menu in the items of both the TVShowListFragment and TVShowProgressFragment.
The code in both classes are very similar so it will probably become one sigle method in a helper class.

Here in words what I'm doing when ""Mark watched"" is selected on a season item:
- I start a loader to get all episode id's
- when finished, VideoLibrary.SetEpisodeDetails is called for every episode
- each time kodi successfully responds, the progressbar and text of the item is updated. This results is a nice live updating animation.
- when the complete season is marked, the database in synchronised for the complete season.

Some issues, questions:
- Should I use someting like the RefreshItem? This is only available in AbstractInfoFragment...
- when updating the progressbars and text, I should be able to get the current Views for the item because now the wrong views may be updated when scrolling
- after setting the watched states for all episodes, the database is updated for the complete show

Ideally, all of that could happen when I open the Kore app, as it is in most configurations pretty useless outside a local network and without a Kodi server.

I'd like to suggest to add advanced configurations options (possibly on-by-default on new setups) that say:
* Enable WiFi when Kore is started. (This might need additional privileges in Android, but i think that those can easily be argued to be convenient. Connection attempts should be held off until readiness of the network is signaled by Android, to avoid waiting for any timeouts and tempt the user to press reconnect for things to be faster.)
* Send wake-up-on-LAN on every connection attempt. (Those can be sent right after the initial SYN package. If the device is off, no time is lost, and if it's on, the additional one multicast package (or burst) when starting the app won't do any harm)."

The new feature in 2.4.0 that makes it possible to chose to play on Kodi or locally on the Android device is very nice.
However, it is also confusing to regular users: there are now 2 different ""+"" icons on the screen and they do different things. One adds to playlist (next to ""download to device"" and 🗸) and one opens a sub-menu that offers option about where to play.

Two suggestions:
* Change the floating + button back to a play sign (⏵). If one wants to play something, one expects a play button, anything else is confusing (except possibly for a button clearly labeled ""play"", but we are lucky that ⏵is almost universally recognised).
* Second idea: differentiate the default choice (play on Kodi) from the secondary choice (play locally on Android device) by making the two choices two different colours.
Signal does this for its ""send message"" button for instance: the normal option is the default blue, the other option is grey.

Looking at the colours, I was thinking ""Play on Kodi"" could be the same colour as the theme's default and  ""Play locally"" could be the same but less saturated. This might be the tricky bit, finding a colour type that works with the different themes.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Fix signing release apk,[],
xbmc/Kore,open,"Auto-update app music list after ""Update Audio Library""?",[],"So I've set up this app with a raspberry pi media center for my dear father, and he likes it very much, save for some frustrations. One is: we can add new music with Filezilla over the network, and then we have to update the music library (through Kore, library maintenance -> update audio library), but then we have to pull-down to refresh the music search results for the app to see the library's new music in Kore.

Since the app initiated the library refresh, could it automatically update it's local cache of music afterwards to see new results faster? That whole refresh process doesn't seem intuitive to someone who doesn't understand how caches work, and this might ease some frustrations.

Any thoughts?  "

xbmc/Kore,closed,An error occured while syncing: Invalid params,[],"OS: LibreELEC (a [community testbuild](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=298462&page=219)
Kore: v2.3.3 from f-droid
Kodi: Leia 18.0-ALPHA2 Git:19eb19e

Hi,
I'm using LibreELEC and I'm getting this error on syncing the music library:
> An error occured while syncing: Invalid params

The TV Shows and Movies library sync to Kore successfully.

I'm not too sure what to make of it, there aren't really any parameters one can tweak on the Kore side.

I got Kore to sync the music collection on a previous occasion (using a slightly older version of LibreELEC and the same version of Kore), but there was an issue: I thought Kore hadn't synced the whole music library, but it turned out Kodi hadn't scraped it properly. I after that, trying to refresh the Kore music library gave the same error (`invalid params`).
I then removed the Kodi instance from Kore and re-added it, and I'm still seeing `invalid params`.

On the LibreELEC side, I've tried removing the source and rebuilding the music library, this hasn't changed the error on the Kore side.
One last thing that could make a difference, I have a path substitution for the music in my advancedsettings.xml which I was planning to use when I switch back to a centralised MySQL database sharing:
>
    <from>/mnt/stuff/audio/</from>
    <to>/storage/music/</to>

Thanks!"

To use the test orchestrator we needed to upgrade the build tools which caused 
the PagerSlidingTabStrip from astuetz to fail. As the project seems dead, I replaced it with
PagerTabStrip from the support library. This does use a different layout for the pager so
we probably need to discuss how to incorporate the PagerTabStrip or use an alternative.

I have been using for over a year
KODI (WINDOWS 10) + KORE (Samsung Galaxy S7). 
As a TV server running with me Mediaportal Version. 1.19.
 
There are 3 lists in the PVR_section of KORE:
1. TV channels
2. Radio stations
3. Recordings
Display and control of TV channels and radio stations everything super.
 
Only operation of the recording list is impractical if the list becomes longer.
The latest recording is always at the bottom of the list  :-(
 
Why can not the PVR pick list be sorted? 
Sorting (descending) by start date / time would be very helpful!

xbmc/Kore,closed,Refactored ApiFuture,[],"Refactored the ApiFuture setup, introduced by @monzee in #473, to make the code more [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)).

* Moved logic on how to execute an ApiMethod from ApiFuture to HostManager to make
  usage more clear and remove the cyclic dependency between ApiFuture and HostConnection.
  Cyclic dependency was found in ApiFuture.from() using the HostConnection to execute
  the ApiMethod, and the HostConnection containing an execute method that wraps
  the ApiMethod in an ApiFuture.
* Implemented a version of withCurrentHost to support using callbacks to
  simplify handling the result of an ApiFuture in an Activity or Fragment.
* Refactored ApiFuture and OpenSharedUrl to provide more meaningful error messages.
* Refactored Session interface into an HostAction abstract class to clarify
  its usage and be able to handle device configuration changes in Fragments
  as well as Activities.
* Added copyright statements to OpenSharedUrl and ApiFuture.
  Original author forgot to include them. I used the overall XBMC copyright
  as the project in general falls under the XBMC copyright license.
* Refactored RemoteActivity and moved waiting on an ApiMethod result to
  HostManager. RemoteActivity is notified of any result through callbacks
  now. This reduces code duplication."

2. Connect and confirm that Kore can control the Kodi device.
3. Close the Kodi app, or turn your phone on standby long enough for the connection to close.
4. Unplug your router from the internet.
5. Open the Kore app and try to control the Kodi device.  It should fail to connect and be stuck on ""Connecting..."".

xbmc/Kore,closed,Fix PVR section back navigation,[],
xbmc/Kore,closed,Fix memory leaks in lists that use CursorAdapter,[],"Following issue #514, activities that have lists were being leaked, the reason being the internal `Cursors` (which seem to be reused/pooled in Android, so they have a lifecycle separate from activities) were keeping references to the activity's `Adapter`, therefore keeping it from being GC'ed.

The constructor for `CursorAdapter` being used up until now is [this one](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CursorAdapter.html#CursorAdapter(android.content.Context,%20android.database.Cursor,%20boolean)), which sets the flag `FLAG_REGISTER_CONTENT_OBSERVER`, unnecessary in `CursorAdapters` that will be used with `CursorLoaders` (according to [the docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CursorAdapter.html#FLAG_REGISTER_CONTENT_OBSERVER)).

Using the other constructor doesn't set that flag, so the `Cursor` doesn't hold up the `Adapter` and the enclosing activities."
xbmc/Kore,closed,Prevent the refresh animation from appearing in a silent sync,[],"When a silent sync is running the refresh animation shouldn't appear and this wasn't being respected in some situations. For instance, when not connected to Kodi, starting from a TV Show details, selecting one episode or season and hitting back, the animation would appear. This PR makes sure that it is only shown if it isn't silent."

xbmc/Kore,closed,Change the source of AlbumGenres table to support Kodi v18,[],"As detailed in [#13051](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/13051), Kodi v18 changes the way album genres are handled, as the genreId info ceases to be available at the album level being only available at the songs level.

This impacts Kore because `GetAlbums` and `GetAlbumDetails` won't return the `genreId` tag, which is used to populate the local AlbumGenres table.

This PR takes that into account, and changes the source of the local AlbumGenres table to be the `genreId` returned at the song level (by `GetSongs`), making it more consistent with the way Kodi will handle things from now on.

@DaveTBlake you might want to take a look at this, to make sure that it is working correctly. Note that Kore has a local database, which has the genre info at the album level (not the song level). I haven't changed this, as it isn't strictly necessary to make it work with the jsonrpc API changes. 

PS. One other suggestion: you might want to remove the `genreid` params from the [json rpc wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API/v8#Audio.Fields.Album)"

While playing a video, I would have expect the arrows to work the same as with a physical remote using CEC : up and down to change the chapter, and left and right for skipsteps.

With Kore V2.3.3 this is not working. I can't remember if it was working before, I'm sorry.

My Kodi host is a LibreElec 8.2.3 (Kodi 17.6), and my phone is running Android 7.0

Can someone confirm this is a bug? Or can you add it as a feature request?

Should you need any more information, please let me know.

I chose not to use any of the existing FAB speed dial implementations as I couldn't find any that was well supported and met my design requirements. The one from @yavski, that we used in #301, seems to be abandoned.

xbmc/Kore,open,[Feature Request] Add PgUp/PgDn buttons or other way to scroll through lists quickly,[],Some plugins offer nearly endless lists of items and scrolling through these takes ages. It would be great if Kore offered a way to navigate through long lists more quickly. PgUp/PgDn buttons are the first thing that come to my mind. Jumping to the first item beginning with a specific letter would be another option.
xbmc/Kore,closed,Fixed removing highlight on < v21 devices,[],"  It seems tinting is applied on pre-Lollipop devices using
     a color filter. HighlightButton used clearColorFilter to remove
     the highlight color and revert back to the original color. This
     caused an issue on < v21 devices as the View would loose its tint."
xbmc/Kore,closed,[Feature Request] Enable list item selection from Kore,[],"It's no good user experience to keep switching view between a TV and a smartphone constantly when selecting items from a list. I think #179 aims the same target - preventing the constantly changing focus between smartphone and TV.

became an issue with the release of API 27. In Android 8.1 the
shared element view is removed from the exiting fragment. This
causes Android to call the removeView method from AdapterView
which is not implemented and causes the app to crash.

We can reenable shared element transitions for API 27 and up by
refactoring the GridView usage to RecycleView.

AFAICT PVR section does not support shared element transitions right?"
xbmc/Kore,open,[Feature Request] Add ability to customise website used for actor bios,[],"When tapping an actor on the ""Now Playing"" page it's a nice feature that this opens up their IMDB profile to discover more.

I can find numerous reports in googleplay dashboard regarding a nosuchmethod error:

```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
  at org.xbmc.kore.ui.sections.addon.AddonsActivity.onAddonSelected (AddonsActivity.java:130)
  at org.xbmc.kore.ui.sections.addon.AddonListFragment$1.onItemClick (AddonListFragment.java:75)
```

Weird thing is that the call is about calling [setSquarePoster](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/sections/addon/AddonsActivity.java#L130) which is available in [AbstractFragment](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/AbstractFragment.java#L87). So everything should just work BUT the [dataHolder](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/AbstractFragment.java#L25) that is passed from the `AddonListFragment` to `AddonsActivity` to start the `AddonInfroFragment` is of type `AddonInfoFragment.DataHolder` which should be just `DataHolder` as it is defined in `AbstractFragment`. However, `AbstractInfoFragment` extends `AbstractFragment` and thus the code should just work... I'm suspecting some inheritance issues here. Any ideas?

Il there a way to do this?
Thanks a lot for your answers.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Implemented a scalable control pad,[],"This should hopefully fix issue #383 and fix the issue with the original version from PR #428. The original version did not include a check to see if the event server was disabled by the user. This was probably the reason some users reported [issues](#444) with the control pad not working during the beta release of 2.3.X.

I falsely assumed that checking if the event server connection failed, the variable [eventServerConnection](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/pull/428/files#diff-ac8a1a6886da87c8fca766e573e68538R563) would be set to null. This is only the case if hostname resolving fails. Thus, if the event server is not available and the user disabled its usage we would still be using it and do not fall back to using the HTTP input events. This has been [fixed](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/compare/master...poisdeux:feature/scalablecontrolpad?expand=1#diff-ac8a1a6886da87c8fca766e573e68538R238) now.

In general the following changes have been made in this PR:

   * Refactored RemoteFragment and created a compound view for the
     actual remote. I called it ControlPad to make it more clear what
     its main function is.
   * Implemented a custom grid layout (SquareGridLayout) that will
     always be square. When its width and height are both set to
     match_parent, it will take the smallest of the two as the
     actual size.
   * For devices with a smallest width smaller then 360dp the ControlPad
     is sized to the maximum available space. For larger devices we still
     use the old fixed sizes.


"
xbmc/Kore,closed,Implemented integration tests for the control pad,[],"   * Added two abstract methods setSharedPreferences and
     configureHostInfo to allow test classes extending
     AbstractTestClass to set preferences or change the host info.
   * Implemented a mock event server to test event server commands
   * Implemented a handler to handle JSON input events over HTTP"

I found a couple of problems with YT playlist shares:
- the first item is always skipped
- if you share a playlist while Kodi is currently playing, it seems to lockup when it finishes the current item and tries to load the shared playlist.

I have a feeling these aren't caused by the client. The Kodi I'm using is also a version behind so these might not be true anymore."

As a result, I always need to temporarily enable the web server when I'm setting up an Android device in the local network.

Please consider disabling the check (or making it optional -- for example, if there is actual HTTP functionality used, it could show a warning like ""Without the HTTP server enabled, features X and Y will not be available. Continue anyway?"").

If HTTP isn't needed any more at all, the port, user name and password fields are not needed any more at all, and the documentation at http://syncedsynapse.com/kore/kore-faq needs updating."

Also encountered a bug in the current release when opening the new Addons sections on devices running Android versions prior to lollipop. We forgot to include a check to make sure we do not call [getTransitionName()](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/sections/addon/AddonsActivity.java#L130) on devices prior to lollipop."

As seen on the screenshots above, the mute, random and repeat buttons are barely visible on the day theme, probably because they are white on light background, instead of grey on white that the playback (stop, play etc) buttons are.

History: I have been using kore since version 2.0, I installed it through play store and I have also enrolled to get beta versions as well. 

Until version 2.1.x the cross was big, almost filling the screen from edge to edge, as shown here

On version 2.3.0 the cross became big again, like on 2.1.x, but on 2.3.2 (a few days later) it got back to the annoying 2.2 size. 
So, can you please make an option for the size of it? And yes, I did miss the 2.3.1 update, maybe because it was not available in play store."

I hope this is the correct spot to drop translation bugs but I don't have a forum account and you may be able to forward this to the german translator from here:

How to reproduce:

- Use Kore in german localization

- Hit the download button

A minor bug is the word ""Hintergrung"" in the following sentence:

actual word (wrong): 
`Hintergrung`

new word (correct):
`Hintergrund`


I would happily write the correct string myself but would need assistance on how to do that. 
I am not a developer and don't know my ways around git (github) except for filing a bug report here and there.
If someone is willing to show me the file that needs to be edited and how to give it back to the project afterwards, I would be very happy to help and do the fix myself

I'm using the latest Kore from F-Droid on a reasonably secured phone, including AFWall+ to control which connections I accept.

I can't seem to find a setting for this, nor any documentation, or anything on the Web.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Implemented a scalable control pad (remote),[],"   * Refactored RemoteFragment and created a compound view for the
     actual remote. I called it ControlPad to make it more clear what
     its main function is.
   * Implemented a custom grid layout (SquareGridLayout) that will
     always be square.

The control pad uses the square grid layout instead of a relative
layout to position the buttons. By using the square grid layout the
control pad is sized based on available space instead of using the
static smallest width dimensions.
To prevent the control pad from getting too big on large devices
(smallest width 410 and larger) a blank space has been added between the
media panel and the control pad.

I included the sw400dp just to be sure people with a 6 inch device still be able to use the remote with one hand. I included the sw600dp value as the remote got really big on my Nexus 7. We might need to add even higher values for 10 inch tablets. But I assume people using 10 inch devices use both hands to control the device.

2.  When navigating to the music section of the remote (via the kore menu) I am able to see artists, albums, etc.  Clicking on an album and pressing play properly starts playing at track 1 and queues the rest of the album.  Clicking on an Artist then a song or on a song from the Songs list and selecting ""add to playlist"" returns a ""Couldn't queue media file"" error siting ""Invalid params...""

In each corner of the main direction control there are 4 auxiliary icons. The problem is when controlling Kodi with the directional arrows it is easy to accidentally press one of these 4 auxiliary icons because they are so close to the main directional arrows. There seems to be a lot of screen real-estate and I thought it would be nice if these auxiliary icons could be moved outwards towards the edges of the screen to prevent accidental control problems. 
Please see the picture below to see my proposal changes.

Thanks for your consideration.

Right now the implementation is not very user friendly
requiring going through a hidden drop down menu then choose subtitle then we can choose  the subtitle language or turn on/off subtitle.

This is extremely cumbersome.

1. We need a dedicated subtitle button always showing.

1. Launch Kore and connect to your media center
2. Tap the hamburger menu and select Music
3. Search for a track you’d like to hear, tap its menu button and select “Play”.

Expected result:

I would expect OSMC to play the song I selected.

Actual result:

On Kore 2.1.0, actual result = expected result. On Kore 2.2.0, the playlist will be filled with one or more random songs. I retried multiple times, selecting the same song each time, and got different playlists each time.

After removing Kore 2.2.0, installing 2.1.0 and setting up the media center from scratch, everything was back to normal. Upgrading to 2.2.0 again brought the bug back—seems it’s really the Kore version.

Kore 2.2.0, downloaded from F-Droid.
Android 7.1 (LineageOS 14.1-20170123-NIGHTLY-bacon) on OnePlus One

xbmc/Kore,closed,Inefficient API is used,[],"Dear developers,

I found an inefficient API, setImageResource(), is widely used in Kore.

For setImageResource(), Google says this:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html#setImageResource(int)
"" This does Bitmap reading and decoding on the UI thread, which can cause a latency hiccup. If that's a concern, consider using setImageDrawable(android.graphics.drawable.Drawable) or setImageBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap) and BitmapFactory instead. ""

I noticed that in the following code, setImageResource() is used:

(1) org.xbmc.kore.utils.UIUtils.java    (line number: 226)
https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/utils/UIUtils.java

(2) org.xbmc.kore.ui.NowPlayingFragment.java   (line number: 760, 763, 766)

https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/sections/remote/RemoteFragment.java

(4) org.xbmc.kore.ui.NavigationDrawerFragment.java   (line number: 502, 517)

https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/sections/audio/AlbumDetailsFragment.java

The use of setImageResource() will affect Kore's performance, maybe we should replace it with setImageDrawable() or setImageBitmap(), and move Bitmap reading and decoding to a background thread.

Thanks.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Image loading is in the UI thread,[],"Dear developers,

For image loading, Google says this:
https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/index.html
"" Loading bitmaps on the UI thread can degrade your app's performance, causing slow responsiveness or even ANR messages.""

I noticed that in the following code, image loading is in the UI thread: 
https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/xbmc/kore/ui/sections/remote/RemoteFragment.java#L271 
org.xbmc.kore.ui.RemoteFragment.java  --->adjustRemoteButtons()   (line number: 271)

the image resource is : https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/remote_background_square_black_alpha.png

adjustRemoteButtons() is called by: org.xbmc.kore.ui.RemoteFragment.java    onCreateView()
which means image loading is in the UI thread.

Do you think perform image loading in the UI thread will affect Kore's performance? If so, perhaps moving the images loading to a work thread can help make app more smooth in user interaction.
Looking forward to your response.

The general idea is that the concrete detail fragments only provide the information (model) that needs to be displayed. The abstract fragment contains the logic (control, view) to actually display the information.

To be able to move the logic up we need to determine on what in general the detail fragment should show. I've created a mockup showing the common elements in my opinion:

![detailsfragment svg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4527626/21564965/48612fd8-ce92-11e6-8127-5b61a444aca5.png)

We then use getters that each concrete detail fragment needs to implement. If the getter returns null we can remove the element from the UI if it is not mandatory. This way we can accomodate all detail fragments.
I consider the following elements mandatory: **Art**, **Poster**, **Title**.

  * **addon**
  * **audio**
  * **file**

xbmc/Kore,closed,Media control while screen locked,[],"This is related to #235 and #157.

Apart from being able to control the volume with the volume keys while the screen is locked, it would be great to have an interface for play/pause/next, as many music players have, accessible when the screen is locked. The [open-source Timber music player for Android](https://github.com/naman14/Timber) implements this (in case it is useful as a reference for the implementation).

![screenshot_20161015-164453](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/526577/19410900/46b23dca-92f7-11e6-8654-c958681a0d85.jpeg)
- Volume control is already justified in #235 and #157.
- Play/pause is useful also when an interruption occurs (i.e.: while watching a movie). So that you can pause quickly without needing to unlock your phone in the first place.
- Next/prior may be useful as well when using Kodi as a music player. This way, again, the user can play the next song quickly without having to unlock first.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Added three tests to test clearing the search view,[],"These tests were already included in #223 but never executed as they were missing the @Test annotation.
"
xbmc/Kore,closed,Fixed printing false message during gradle configuration phase,[],"The println is invoked during gradle's configuration phase as well. During the configuration phase all projects are executed. This created some confusion, as it looked like the SET_ANIMATION_SCALE was granted for all flavors and not just the instrumentationTest flavor.

xbmc/Kore,closed,[jenkins] - fix sigining of apk,[],"what the title says ...

"
xbmc/Kore,closed,Activity stack all messed up,[],"Launch KORE and it goes to the ""remote"" activity.
Then open the drawer and select another activity, such as ""Movies"".
Then hit the remote BUTTON from the action menu.
Then hit BACK. It goes to movies.
Then hit BACK again. It goes to remote.

In this manner, it is possible to create an activity stack with any number of any activity in it, duplicated many times. This is very very ugly behavior.

The ""remote"" activity should _always_ be at the bottom of the stack. Switching to remote (by any means) should clear the stack all the way down to it. Switching between non-root activities should clear the stack to the bottom and then add a new one above it.

BACK button should drop to remote activity if you aren't already there, or exit if you are in the remote activity.
"
xbmc/Kore,closed,Sync delay steps,[],"Sometime when I have a wrong version of subtitles it often gets out of sync and there's no easy way to adjust it. Since I don't know how much to delay I have to do several trial and error sessions and each one takes clicking through a long series of menus.

I'm not sure what's the best solution here, so I'll describe what I did/want.

The current implementation opens the Kodi slider where you can offset by a small step (0.1s) and only see the results once you click ok.
My idea to fix it is to add 2 buttons (+/- delay) on the Kore's subtitles submenu that will allow to quickly adjust the subtitles by a more significant step and have immediate feedback (the finer control is still available).
I added +0.5s and -0.5s buttons using the dialog's ok/cancel buttons.
I still want to keep the dialog visible for further adjustments after clicking, but even without calling dismiss() explicitly it still disappear (why?).

xbmc/Kore,closed,Fixed issue showing songs without an album or artist,[],"This should provide a fix for issue #7 

Note that this introduces a database update to include the artist identifier in the songs table. This is needed to be able to retrieve the artist when there is no album associated with the song.

"
xbmc/Kore,closed,Issue/#219,[],"This PR includes PR #237. You probably want to review and merge that first.

This should fix issue #219 for music items. It should be implemented for other media items as well. But I want to show/discuss my proposed solution first.

The problem with the current way of determining if there are more items available on Kodi, is that it uses the size of the list of returned elements. When requesting media items from Kodi through JSON RPCs the `start` and `end` index are given for some media. To determine if there are more items available on Kodi, the size of the returned list is used (which should equal `end - start`). If Kodi returns less items than the requested size, it is assumed that all items have been retrieved.
I noticed that with Jarvis, Kodi may return a list smaller than `end - start`. This will make Kore stop recursing and thus only retrieve a small part of the available items.
Fortunately, Kodi returns the limit with the actual returned `start` and `end` indices. My solution uses this, to determine if we should recurse and get more items. I have tested my solution with Isengard and Jarvis and AFAICT it works.
(I'm thinking of adding a unit test for this in the future)

When there is media playing, the (un)mute button is only visible on the ""now playing"" screen, not on the ""remote"" screen and it is not highlighted to indicate the muted state when Kodi was muted before the current playback started.

I did spend some time going through different screens to find the (un)mute button, only on one of the three ""remote"" screens. Although Kodi displays a very visible red ""muted"" icon in the top right corner of the screen, I regularly use Kore as a headless remote when playing music. A more prominent mute state button would be handy, certainly in the case where Kore is used to control Kodi without a screen.

Steps to reproduce: Play some music, mute Kodi in the ""now playing""screen of Kore, stop all playback. Go to music, start playback of any artist or album. Go to Menu > Remote and there is no (un)mute button or indication. When you swipe left the (un)mute button is visible but not highlighted to indicate the currently muted state.

2. Actually, it would be useful if you could completely hide the Remote tab: if you're using Kore Remote for headless music playback you only need the Now Playing and Playlist tabs. 
3. Could you provide an option with which the user can hide all unused or superfluous menu tabs, e.g. albums, genres, (music) videos?
4. Finally, please can you add a radio stations tab to the Music menu? Something similar to the feature in Music Pump remote? Where you can use a file browser to select and add a .strm file.

3. Later on in the episode (eg whilst credits are showing), press the next track button in Kore.
4. Observe the seek bar on the 'remote' page in Kore (the left hand page).

**Expected:**
After pressing next track, the seek bar / playback position should reset to 0 minutes and 0 seconds, and then start incrementing as the new file starts to play.

**Actual:**
The seek bar still shows the progress as being 95% through the old episode length and eg 58 minutes 06 seconds into the episode. It's not until the play/pause button is pressed twice (to toggle playback) that the position updates and shows the correct value.

This also occurred when I didn't use the next track button in Kore, but manually enqueued a new episode up, after the first had stopped playing.

xbmc/Kore,open,Music: list sorting is not (entirely) intuitive,[],"Hi,

Currently, the lists in the Music category (and possibly elsewhere) are sorted as follows:
- punctuation
- 0-1
- A-Z
- '['
- a-z
- śpéçïal characters, uppercase ({, ¡, Æ, Á, etc.)
- śpéçïal characters, lowercase (æ,á, etc.)
- other unicode (Japanese script, in my case)

While some of us are used to this way of sorting, I believe many people will find this confusing as they won't think to look at the bottom of the list for a lower-case version of the artist or album they are looking for. If they've even already been to the bottom of the list and seen lowercase items are there.

Interesting too, this effect combines with the fact ""The"" is removed before sorting.
So you can have ""The sound of animals fighting"", between ""silverchair"" and ""snapcase"", which looks odd and might be even more confusing to some people.

Ideally, I think special characters should be put in the alphabetical list as much as possible, ie Tool's album ""Æenima"" should not be _after_ Z but in the As.

Thanks :)

xbmc/Kore,closed,“Various Artists” albums don't show song artists,[],"Hi,

Right now, if an album is marked as Various Artists, Kore will show the following when showing the album: tracknumber, title and track length.

But not the artist.

It is often hard to know what song you're about to play without the artist's name ;)

I think putting the artist's name where the track length currently is and moving track length to the right of that should work nicely to solve the issue.

Thanks!

"
xbmc/Kore,open,"Too easy to refresh local list of artists, albums, etc. by mistake",[],"Hi there,

Context: I have a rather large collection of music, so the Kore's local list of artists takes quite some time to build/refresh.

Issue: While the material design concept of pulling from the top of the list to refresh a list is aesthetically pleasing, and makes a lot of sense for lists of entries that are often updated and are in chronological order (ie: Twitter feed), it doesn't make so much sense in our context: we don't really browse to the top of the list and then want to see if there's anything new.
Worse, it's happened to me twice recently as I was scrolling up and down my list of artists to involuntarily refresh the list. (This also puts Kore in that weird in-between state where it takes a long time to finish, but if I go into an artist and interrupt the update, I end up with missing artists and/or empty artists, so I'm just left waiting)

Proposed solution: I think it would be better to have the refresh option as a dedicated button.
Two options I can think of for that:
- put the refresh icon (set of revolving arrows or whatever) next to the magnifying glass and remote icon, top right of the music screen
- or put refresh icon directly next to the word Music, in the side pull menu, so that 90% of the button goes to the Music screen and 10 % refreshes the content of the Music screen.

Sorry for the lengthy explanation and thanks for considering this issue :)

cheers

xbmc/Kore,closed,[Bug]Enter/Return on external/physical keyboard for text input,[],"This is an edge case that is likely not a high priority but if super-easy to fix, it would be nice for consistency.

When the text input dialog is up to send text to a dialog in Kodi, typically you use the on-screen keyboard to enter the text on the local dialog on the remote (which is a very useful feature) and then hit the enter/return button on the on-screen keyboard which will be labeled Send in that instance of the keyboard. This sends the text to Kodi and works as expected.

However, if one is using an external keyboard or a device with a built in physical keyboard, hitting the enter/return key on that keyboard after input of text just pops down the local text input dialog and sends nothing to Kodi. The text dialog on Kodi remains empty and up while there is no text dialog locally on the remote any more. So if you happened to do this on the external/physical keyboard, you have to select Send Text Input form the overflow menu, enter the text again and remember to tap Send on the onscreen dialog.

xbmc/Kore,closed,TV Shows view capped at 299 entries,[],"When presented with a large library, Kore fails to scan all titles to be browseable on Android.  A seemingly random selection of titles do scan properly, totaling approximately 299 titles.  (Unfortunately, since there isn't a counter built into Kore itself, I'm relying on my relatively fallible ability to count by hand.)  If a title on that list is removed from the library and subsequently re-added, it does not subsequently reappear; another title takes its place.  My suspicion, although I am unable to demonstrate this rigorously, is that shows are somehow being added in reverse last-modified order until a certain maximum number is reached, after which Kore stops scanning and caching.

Steps to replicate: have a library with 300 or more TV Show entries in it; attempt to scan that library with Kore.

Expected outcome: all TV shows in library are visible through Kore.

Actual outcome: total number of visible TV show entries is capped at approximately 299.

xbmc/Kore,closed,[feature request] Full control of add-ons,[],"Hi,

Ok, first of all, I realise this is likely to require a large amount of work, but I think it would be a very neat enhancement.
Instead of simply showing installed add-ons and taking you to the add-on's screen, it would be great if we could actually control the add-on from Kore.

The main problem I see is that there is no standardisation of how add-ons work and what they do. One solution could be to get add-ons to come with a mapping of their (main?) functions, which could be used by Kore to build the menus and send the events/requests.

As Kore is now the official Kodi remote, this might give us enough weight to suggest that add-ons need to now include this description which could be used to control them. That should probably be discussed with the main Kodi team.

As an example, here is an actual use case. I use the DI.fm app a fair bit, it's pretty simple: open add-on, add-on loads list of DI radios, I click radio, music magically appears.
This same could be done on Kore (go to add-ons, DI, see list of radio, select radio) avoiding having to turn the TV on just to listen to music.

Another use case is adding items to the playlist (say Vimeo or Youtube videos) while a video is already playing and thus using up the main display.

Anyway, I'd be interested in discussing this enhancement and your opinion on how feasible it is.

Cheers

I'm not sure what the best UI for this is, but some quick ideas:
- When dragging, use 5% steps initially (that's 2 minute steps for a tv show, 6 minute steps for a movie). As soon as you stop moving the slider (while still touching the screen), switch to a second one that has high precision (10s maybe? I don't think anyone needs anything lower), but only for the previously selected window (+-1min for a 40m file, +-3min for a 2h file)

First of all, thanks for this great new Kodi remote :)

Could you consider adding a currently playing indicator on the currently playing item in the playlist (right of the remote). Right now, I can see anything (on 1.1.0) to tell me what is the item being played, so I have to swipe backwards and forwards between the remote and the playlist.
I guess a simple change in background colour or a halo effect would be nice. I simple “play” symbol might not be enough though.

Also, I was half-expecting the playlist to be already jumped to the currently playing song, rather than just show the first items of the list, when one is halfway through the list, for instance.
Maybe that could be an option, as it's possible not everyone wants to jump to currently playing song/item.

Thanks!

xbmc/Kore,closed,Now playing notification persists on Kore removal from recent apps.,[],"Thank you for taking the time to comprehensively reply to #31. I don't have rights to reopen the issue so creating this to comment, hope that's okay.

The notification behaves exactly as you described in #31 except:

> removing it from the recent apps, shouldn't affect the notification.

Is what I meant by 'Kore closed' (apologies for confusing the terminology).

When Kore is removed from recent apps (the card is swiped away) the notification no longer updates or responds to changes in what is now playing as described in your response and does not disappear until a) some unspecified time later (which I assumed was an OS reap?) or b) Kore is re-opened.

It's as though it 'freezes' in the last state Kore knew about before it was removed from recent apps.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Now playing notification persists on Kore shutdown.,[],"If Kore is closed whilst the now playing notification is displayed, the now playing notification persists (i.e. it doesn't go away). The notification no longer updates with the current item being played on Kodi and only disappears when either reaped by Android or Kore is restarted and a new item played.

Expected behaviour (from a user perspective), notification closes with Kore.

xbmc/Kore,closed,[Feature Request] Visual volume indicator,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As a user, it would be useful for me to have a visual indicator in Kore of the volume level in Kodi on volume change.

Use case, I often play / queue music using Kore as a control whilst I have the Kodi screen off (sometimes from the next room). An indicator of Kodi volume in Kore would act as visual feedback that changing the volume (via icon or hardware keys) was having an effect.

Personal preference, a slider overlay of some kind which is only displayed for a few seconds on volume change but which could also be directly manipulated by touch.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Make codec button switch between codec/context if playing/notplaying,[],"This is what I have been using to allow the remote to trigger the context menu.  Without which it is difficult to do a few things such as queue a playlist.

This commit makes the codec button context sensitive so if media is loaded ( `switchToPanel(R.id.media_panel)`) the codec button triggers, otherwise the context menu triggers (`switchToPanel(R.id.info_panel)`).

This is not ideal, as even though media is loaded/playing/paused and the media_panel might be loaded, the media could be in the background and you could be wandering around the menus wanting to trigger the context menu, forcing you to stop the media so that switchToPanel goes back to the info_panel to trigger the context menu.  Am unsure if you can ask kodi if the media is in the background? Also the bitmap would need to be also switched on the codec button which I have not done.

I probably never need a codec button and would have no issue if it were just a context button, but this seemed like a good compromise at the time.  Might be better to have it always a context menu button and hide the codec function away in a menu or something.

Anyhow noticed someone else reported an issue #19 about this so posting this in case useful, feel free to close or I can work on it further if required.

xbmc/Kore,closed,"Remote - missing ""Title"" button","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hey,

On the XBMC remote (the obsolete open source one), there's a button called ""Title"" that let's you get into extra menus and is useful. A good example is to go from the main kodi screen to:
Videos -> Files
You now need the ""Title"" button in order to expose the extra menu that will let you rescan content and etc. Kore has ""Codec"" instead of the ""Title"" button, which does nothing in this case.

Thanks.

xbmc/Kore,closed,Support for songs without an album in Music,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","First of all, thanks for a great app!

What I'm currently missing is support for songs in Music. Right now, I can browse artists, albums and genres. Artists and genres are essentially filters on albums – touching one will show me all albums by that artist or of that genre. Touching an album will just show me the album (again) and give me the option to play the whole album. There's no way to see the names of the individual songs, or add just one song from an album to the playlist (other than by adding the whole album and then examining the playlist). Songs that don't have album info are apparently inaccessible from Kore.

I'd like to be able to:
- See and select individual songs by an artist (including those which are not on any album)
- See and select individual songs of a particular genre, or all artists of a particular genre
- Search for songs by name

Maybe this could be solved with a two-level filter concept:
- Swiping to Artists, Albums or Genres and touching an item will add that item to a filter. The selection is displayed in the navigation bar and the hamburger icon changes to a backward arrow (touching it will remove the filter).
- Users can then swipe between the same pages, but only items matching the filter will be displayed (rather than the entire library).
- Touching another item with the filter active will bring up the list of songs that match both criteria (filter and item touched after that). Users can then either touch the ""Play"" buttom at the bottom to add all songs to the playlist, or touch individual songs to add them to the playlist. (Maybe include a play button in the card for each song to make the action clearer.)

xbmc/Kore,closed,Using the remote arrows to skip forward/backwards,[],"Hey,

Thanks for writing this app. It's significantly better than the rest and it's open source. Good work there. I have one suggestion though:

In the official xbmc remote app (the old unmaintained one), using the left/right arrow keys on the remote skips 30 seconds and the up/down 10 minutes. This is very useful for quickly skipping to a location in a film. Using fast forward is just not as good.

Thanks.
