namsor/gendreapp,closed,API suggestion,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi,

This suggestion relates to the API, is this the wrong place to make a suggestion? 

My suggestion: 

Share the guessed region for the name as well as the gender. 

For my intended application, knowing the likely country of origin of the name and even better the probability of correctness/confidence would be awesome

namsor/gendreapp,closed,Once installed there is no way to reverse what has been done,"[Label(name=""question"")]","There should be a method to reverse what was done, or at least allow the option to do a complete rescan of items already scanned to allow changing the field. Also, having hearts as the default option for females may not be the best idea when a guys wife looks through his phone and sees hearts on all the women. Just sayin.

namsor/gendreapp,closed,How to reverse gender information?,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Great tool! Works pretty well. Show some non categorised but no wrong assignments. Thanks!

Is there any way to reverse this to not to have gender information in names?
