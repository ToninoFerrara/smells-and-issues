Nilhcem/hosts-editor-android,open,Not working with Lineage OS (android 7.1) because /system is mounted in readonly mode,[],"I've instlaled the app through f-droid on a Lineage OS.

Is seems that the problem is that in lineage OS (and maybe in all android 7 systems ?) /system is mounted in readonly mode, so even with root access the app can't write.

Before the change the app should remount /system with write permission, then save the file, then (for security concern) remount it again in readonly mode."

Nilhcem/hosts-editor-android,closed,Avoid prebuilts in source,[],"Hello Nilhcem,

Could you improve your build system so that it doesn't involve java prebuilts being pushed to git like source code? For example, switching to gradle would make this a lot easier. Using submodules with ant like you do with ABS would also work, but it would be more work on your end.

This would allow F-Droid to build your app entirely from source, which is now impossible unless we spend lots of time replacing the jars with the actual source libraries.

Thank you!
