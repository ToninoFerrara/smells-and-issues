1. bluetooth (standard) scanning is keyed off of WifiReceiver's scan, but checks to make sure the previous discovery period has ended before starting a new one. In practice on an MotoZ Play, this means ~ every 20s.
2. bluetooth LE does a discovery cycle off of the same clock, but batches returns rather than receiving individual callbacks on each network.
3. there's currently an english text dictionary to double check reported device classes against, but there's a sizable icon library for known types present at several resolutions to help with i18n (intention is that the words can go away once we're satisfied.) no icon shown for Misc and Uncategorized BT nets.
4. We're overriding the frequency field *even more* than with cells - since the networkClass is an int, we're shoving it in there. This is probably a hack we shouldn't be doing."

Would it make more sense to split the table by lengths into three tables? Then, only the 9 character length table would be checked for the 9 character substring, and the 7 for the 7, and the 6 for the 6. It could be further optimized by only checking the 9 character length table if the first six characters matched the magic number; that could also indicate a missing value if the latter three of nine characters didn't match (magic match but value not in table)."

I think the Run duration amount would be better implemented as only incrementing when Scanning is turned on. Benefits from this:

* If you scan on the way to work, turn off scanning while at work, then resume scanning after work, it wouldn't look like the device was scanning on its own.

It might or might not be removed from the notification area. A telltale indication is that WW's activity takes a few hundred milliseconds for the text to show up instead of nearly instantly.

After termination, the foreground activity doesn't recover gracefully:

* The hamburger menu no longer permits activity changes (e.g. can't change from Network List to Dashboard or vice versa; whatever was active last in foreground is what you're stuck with). Thankfully, the Exit item still functions and is adequate to exit the app (stopping the service) and the app can be run properly again.
* Most of the time, the upper area in Network List doesn't respond to changes (e.g. counts stay at zero or otherwise don't increase, Lat stays ""(Waiting for GPS sync...)"" and Lon and Speed blank even after ""Now have location from gps"" toast/audio).

wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving,closed,Bad location data in location and network probably due to losing GPS,[],"I have a couple of issues with Wigle on a LG Nexus 4 phone (stock android 5.1.1). I'm not sure if it's device specific or a general issue. 

First and a minor one is that sometimes the ""location"" table contains wrong location data, eg:

```
sqlite> select _id,level,lat,lon,altitude,accuracy,time from location order by lat desc limit 100;
_id         level       lat         lon         altitude    accuracy        time      
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  --------------  ----------
748         -87         Inf         -Inf        0.0         566.0791015625  0         
749         -91         Inf         -Inf        0.0         566.0791015625  0     
750         -86         Inf         -Inf        0.0         566.0791015625  0         
751         -90         Inf         -Inf        0.0         566.0791015625  0         
752         -91         Inf         -Inf        0.0         566.0791015625  0         
4252        -66         Inf         -Inf        0.0         0.924082756042  0         
...
```
""Inf"" and ""-Inf"" are not valid WGS84 coordinates, also time=0 even if it's a valid number isn't OK/real. 
This issue is probably caused by saving data before obtaining a GPS fix or after losing it (not sure). 

There are also lines with valid coordinates (although i think the location is wrong - see below) and time=0.

```
_id         level       lat          lon               altitude    accuracy          time      
----------  ----------  -----------  ----------------  ----------  ----------------  ----------
12103       -85         46.06612801  14.5284741499999  0.0         9.52606964111328  0         
12104       -90         46.06603457  14.52453655       0.0         9.52606964111328  0         
```


This causes issues when trying to draw all the points on a map, but can be avoided by filtering out the invalid location when exporting data from sqlite. 

The bigger issue for me is the ""network"" table, where last- and best- locations are stored. 

I have visualised a part of best-location data (one line in 'network' table is one dot drawn with ""bestlon"", ""bestlat"" coordinates - http://i.imgur.com/DF3hHTc.png ). I have actually walked/scanned the bottom part, but the slightly right leaning horizontal ""line of dots"" is due to losing GPS/location errors described above. I never actually walked there. 

I have picked a known network/AP (larger, red dot, marked 'BSSID'), and visualised the data from 'location' table (each dot is a line from location table drawn at lat/lon coordinates; my selected AP is marked with larger red dots and 'BSSID - image: http://i.imgur.com/MtlGiGZ.png ). The actual location of the access point is in the bottom part of the image (close to where three more sighthings are drawn (larger red dots). The approximate distance between the three dots in the bottom part of the image, and the upper dot is ~1km.  Data: 

```
sqlite> select _id,level,lat,lon,altitude,accuracy,time from location where bssid=""<BSSID>"";
_id         level       lat          lon          altitude          accuracy    time         
----------  ----------  -----------  -----------  ----------------  ----------  -------------
24201       -81         46.04416077  14.48949131  348.299987792969  10.0        1482300334000
26714       -60         46.05357032  14.49049531  0.0               60.9652557  0            
26884       -69         46.0441834   14.48921632  337.899993896484  10.0        1482346381000
100093      -80         46.04402456  14.48904799  343.0             4.0         1483432558000

```

Three sightings have correct coordinates and valid GPS data (including time), but one, probably without a GPS fix (time = 0, and a wrong location - upper dot in the image) is also used for 'bestlat'/'bestlon' in 'network' table, since the signal level was the highest there. 

There are also lines in 'network' table where bestlat/bestlon or lastlat/lastlon are +/-Inf:

```
sqlite> select lasttime,lastlat,lastlon,bestlat,bestlat from network order by lastlat limit 5;
lasttime    lastlat     lastlon     bestlat     bestlat   
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
0           -Inf        -Inf        -Inf        -Inf      
0           -Inf        -Inf        -Inf        -Inf      
0           -Inf        -Inf        -Inf        -Inf      
0           -Inf        -Inf        46.4612570  46.4612570
0           -Inf        Inf         46.0650862  46.0650862
```

```
sqlite> select lasttime,lastlat,lastlon,bestlat,bestlat from network order by bestlat limit 5;
lasttime    lastlat     lastlon     bestlat     bestlat   
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
0           -Inf        -Inf        -Inf        -Inf      
0           -Inf        -Inf        -Inf        -Inf      
0           -Inf        -Inf        -Inf        -Inf      
1483223038  46.4615528  13.9437285  -Inf        -Inf      
1483112210  46.0550346  14.5191821  -Inf        -Inf      
```


So, sometimes, (eg.) when I walk into a building, and lose the GPS fix, it makes the location drift in a random direction and then store the invalid location to the database. Sometimes it even stores +/-Inf. If the access points signal is stronger there (and it often is inside buildings), the invalid location is also used for ""bestlat"" and ""bestlon"" fields.  I can also fix this in postprocessing (eg. foreach bssid in 'network' table, select all the sightings from the 'location' table, and pick the highest signal one with valid time and coordinates).

I was wondering if I was the only one with this issues (some weird hw/sw combination), or has anyone else noticed similar errors in data (location points going in random directions, and/or appearing in locations never visited, or +/-Inf coordinates in the 'network' table). Maybe wigle shouldn't store location (to any table), if any of the location data is invalid (eg. +/Inf in coordinates, time==0). I can fix my data when processing, but this issue probably also affects kml export, etc. for other people."

I suggest complementing the usual bulk trawling downtown and idle coasting on highways with:
### Incentivise exploration of unvisited cold pockets near users common area or position.
- Suggesting or some how calling attention to virgin areas and or seldom visited squares.
- Meter and reward pioneering by acknowledge, like every wifi has first discovered by,  now each square(km/mile?) has a pioneer. 
- Meter and reward moderate turfing. Users can take pride in keeping some area up to date. Now each square(km/mile? smaller blocks in crowded areas?) has a last visited by user. But scores are only given for refreshing stale connection. (maybe even negative incentive for over refreshing(excluded home and work without breaking anonymity)).
- Reminder when pioneered and last visitor turf gone cold 
- Reminder when passing nearby virgin land.
- Milestone recognition, Badges for special deeds like going the extra mile
- Connecting local top users in stats without breaking anonymity?

May be to much but. 
- User progress, development and projected future expectation. 
- Reminder when user activity has dropped below projected expectation, 

Caveats are:
- How do we avoid luring people into restricted/unsafe areas where they get into trouble.
- How do we keep wifi primary and the flag planting and pissing on corners as periferial

However, when later (maybe a few seconds) the same APs a found but with a more precise GPS position, I noticed that this new scan is ignored. 

I would expect my local DB to be updated whenever I find an existing AP with a less accurate position (or a weaker signal). This would be especially helpful when ""war-walking"".

wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving,closed,Does this app use a web service?,[],"Hello world!

I'm not an Android developer, so I can't understand the code or at least the program structure.

Reading the website I see the ways to get hotspots are:
https://wigle.net/gps/gps/main/query/
or https://wigle.net/gps/gps/Map/onlinemap2/
And it seems there is a PHP-JSON bridge:
https://wigle.net/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2055
but that last solution requires you have your own server, which is not a good idea.

Is there any way to access wiglenet database using common web services? Something like REST or SOAP? I could use https://wigle.net/gps/gps/main/query/ and process the HTML (scraping) but that's not too much elegant.

Can anyone tell how this app gets all the data from wigle? Or at least tell me the files in JAVA I should read. I would like to know more about it but it's difficult to me reading an Android app code.

Thanks a lot for your time, I appreciate it.

wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving,closed,Bogus rounding in Dashboard view,[],"While watching the dashboard display, I'll often see instances of rounding for the distance measurements, even though the actual precision (at least two significant figures) is better than the display suggests. It's like the opposite of [False precision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_precision).

For example, I'll see ""4.58 miles"" change to ""4.6 miles"" instead of ""4.60 miles"", or ""5.99 miles"" change to ""6 miles"" instead of ""6.00 miles"". The word ""miles"" moves back and forth instead of staying still -- it's slightly distracting in two rows of text.

Hunch: around https://github.com/wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving/blob/master/src/net/wigle/wigleandroid/DashboardActivity.java#L43 insert `.setMinimumFractionDigits( 2 )` (in addition to `.setMaximumFractionDigits( 2 )`).

I know that Android2.x phones have hardware buttons home, menu, back, but Android 3.x or 4.x are not necessarily have hardware buttons.
This may make some of Android 3 or 4 may be unable to reach ""menu"", I think.
