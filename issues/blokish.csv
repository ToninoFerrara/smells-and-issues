scoutant/blokish,open,"Game Play Doesn't Reset or Restart  Upon Exit , Hence Providing No Means To Start A New Game..",[],"#### Expected behavior
One would expect the app to restart and provide a new frame on which they can start a new game after exiting and relaunching the app. 

#### Actual behavior
The app doesn't restart after exit, instead it is back to last state with all the moves and changes still intact upon relaunch. In other words, if a player had moved two blocks or any number of block, even after exiting the game and relaunching, those moves are still intact.

#### How to reproduce
* Launch Blokish
* Play the game for a while.
* Exit the game
* And then relaunch.


### Testing Environment.

* Browser:  Google Chrime
* Operating system: Android Version 7 (Nougat)
* App Version: Blokish v3.2

scoutant/blokish,closed,Can now open playhub,[],"Added an option to open playhub.
If playhub is installed, it opens it directly in its ""new game"" activity with blokish set as the game engine (user only needs to create / choose a group, and it creates a blokish game over it).

scoutant/blokish,closed,Adding online support with PlayHub,[],"This will allow players to play Blokish online against each other.

The idea behind playhub is to play existing games (i.e. Blokish) over existing groups from other apps (i.e. WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, etc). To see more you can download it from google play:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playhub

The adjustments needed to add support for it in Blokish were very small, and have no effect on Blokish users, except for the fact that they can now play Blokish via PlayHub.

For testing purposes i've published the forked app, and it works great! You can see it and play with it here:

scoutant/blokish,closed,Piece flip feature,[],"Hi! Nice game.. recently played blokus and was interested in the strategy!

One issue I notice is that flipping/reversing pieces is not possible (or if it is possible, I haven't figured out how to do it yet)
I would like to see that as one of the options which i feel i do all the time in the physical game..
One way to do it that I would approach from a user UI perspective is adding a mirror option along with the Cross and Check mark so that the piece is flipped.. 
Once I have some free time I would like to add it to the code myself, but if anyone else is able to get to it before, that would be great too!
Cheers..

Thanks for writing this app, it's fun.  I wanted to play multiplayer with a mix of humans and AIs (so, for instance, I could play with my wife and two computer players).  It turns out it was pretty simple to make that happen - I have a fork at https://github.com/matt-gardner/blokish where it appears to be working (though there may be a bug or two at end game, because it currently only checks for redOver).  I know this is a pretty old project - would you be interested in merging these changes, or should I maintain my own fork?  If you are interested, I'll clean it up (fixing spacing, and some other issues) and submit a pull request.
