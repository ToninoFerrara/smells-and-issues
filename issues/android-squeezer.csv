nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,In player screen: Volume control changes volume of wrong player,[],"Hi Nik,
we use the app for quite some time. (years?) Really happy! Thanx.

One thing annoys us: We have 3 players. Two of which are squeezelite (Raspberry Pi). When changing the volume on one of them in the player screen, sometimes the volume of the other one is changed.

Details:
- After tapping on the volume bar of player A there is instant visual feedback by a change of the volume bar of the player A.
- Less than a second after that, the volume of player B changes and the bar of player A changes back to the original setting and the bar of player B changes to the new setting instead.
- Sometimes the same happens in reverse with B - then there is a ""workaround"". Sometimes B will change B...

Regards,
Mathias"

nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,Add tracks to an existing playlist,[],"Hello,

Should it be made possible when you have a number of tracks in your playlist not only to save them in a new playlist (as it is already possible today) but add them to an existing playlist that was created before?
If possible also per track. In this way you can add a track to any existing previous saved playlist.

This should be a huge improvement I think.

Kind regards,
Thierry David"

nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,Remember playlist scroll position when deleting/manipulating contents.,[],"If the playlist is longer than a single page and you scroll from the current playing position to e.g. ""Remove from playlist"" a track on the next page, when the dialogue is completed it snaps back to the current playing position, not the last scroll position. This makes managing a live playlist quite tedious if you want to remove just a few items. There are probably other operations where it would make sense to stay where it was left too, whilst I accept there are some operations where ""snap to play position"" also makes sense.

It would be cool to have a quicker ""remove from playlist"" action, e.g. a swipe right with temporary ""undo"" button, which seems to be a common method these days. I vaguely recall seeing this requested elsewhere too, but can't find it now.

Performing the same search within the LMS web interface gives me the expected results and not just the Artists.

It might be related to Spotify stopped supporting the libspotify library previously used by LMS Spotify plugins and I have switched to the Spotty plugin which uses a different library. I think that is the only change I have made in a while."

I found an inefficient API, setImageResource(), is widely used in squeezer.

For setImageResource(), Google says this:

nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,"Feature Request/Bug: Player Changed after wake up, timing issue",[],"Hi,

I have several hardware (Boom, Radio) and software players (SqueezePlayer Android). I most cases I use Squeezer to control SqueezePlayer on the same device.
But if the android device went to sleep and I use Squeezer again a hardware player (depending which one is first in the list) is selected. 
This seems to be a timing issue, because the local SqueezePlayer needs to register to the LMS after wake up and the hardware player are already connected and listed on LMS. So the local SqueezPlayer is not in the list of players Squeezer has received at wake up. But appears a few seconds later.
On the one hand, it could be useful and comfortable, because Squeezer switches to an available player.
On the other hand, it is very confusing, because you expect to control the same player you used the last time, but you may start something in a complete different room without notification(very unpleasant if you wake up you child by this mistake)  
There are several options how to handle this.
Option1: Don't switch to an other player automatically, display an error and show a list of players available. Recover automatically if the former selected player appears. 
Option2: optional setting: Connect to preferred player $NAME if available.
Option3: at least show an message, that Squeezer has selected a new player $NAME, than the user is aware of.

No idea how hard this is to fix. In any case I would like to say thank you for sending all the time in developing this great app. I like it very much. Would like to see something similar on IOS. Great work! Thanks!

nikclayton/android-squeezer,closed,Squeezer 1.4.1 cannot list players on LMS 7.9,[],"I have had to upgrade to LMS 7.9 because of a ReadyNAS firmware upgrade.  My Squeezer app stopped working at that point: it was unable to enumerate my players (actually only one).  It works with LMS 7.7.

By experimenting, I was able to determine that the problem was that the reply to the initial CLI query ""players 0 20 full_list:1"" has changed between 7.7 and 7.9.

- **LMS 7.7** replies ""players 0 20 full_list:1 count:1 playerindex:0 playerid:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx uuid: ip:192.168.x.x:xxxx name:xxxxxxx model:squeezelite isplayer:1 displaytype:none canpoweroff:1 connected:1""

Looking at the Squeezer code, I had a hunch that the ""playerindex"" parameter was important.  I patched the function __addPlayersLoop_ in /usr/share/perl5/Slim/Control/Queries.pm on my LMS 7.9 to include the parameter, and this did indeed enable Squeezer to work.

I'm leaving this workaround in place, but the correct fix is probably to allow Squeezer to cope without the ""playerindex"" parameter.

I think this is a problem with interop with LMS 7.8 as well.

**UPDATE**:  Here is a diff for the patch to the above-mentioned file, /usr/share/perl5/Slim/Control/Queries.pm.  My version is _7.9.0 - 1479378558_.  This worked for me, but I offer no warranty.  Apply this _**at your own risk**_ and then restart your LMS service.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,Feature Request: edit main menu,[],"I've been trying to create a network music player for my elderly (and easily confused) grandparent. After having tried and given up on Kodi, Chromecast and Neet Airstream, I've decided that Squeezebox is the way to go. However, I'm not convinced that my grandparent will be able to easily navigate their Squeezebox music library and radio streams via Squeezer. Please could you provide an option to edit and simplify the main menu. The following three options would make a great difference:
1. Hide main menu items - I would hide everything but genre and favourites.
2. Rename main menu items - I would rename genre as LIBRARY, and favourites as RADIO (streams).
3. Change / significantly increase the size of the main menu text. And possible that of sub-menus.

Thanks for your time.

However, I notice that while Squeezer seems to load the correct number of entries quickly giving a properly sized list right away, each one sits in a ""Loading..."" stage for a long time.  I'm curious what all it's doing in those loops and if perhaps some of it could be removed or delayed until at least the names themselves are loaded and displayed.  I see that the same sort of thing is happening when browsing artists, but when scrolling to a random area in the list the ""Loading..."" at least finishes quickly.  If I scroll to the middle of the directory view it can take some seconds, even half a minute, before I even know what I'm looking at.

I have found it interesting to search my library for a single word and play the songs
that contains the word in the title/artist/album. 

When searcing I get a list of songs, a list of albums, a list of artists and a list
of genres. 

What I miss is the ability to maybe hold down on one of the four lists to get the menu
where I can select *play*, *play after the currently playing song*, *Add to playlist*
and *download*.

Right now when I want to add ex. all the items from the songs dropdown, I have to click
each of them seperately.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,Re: Bluetooth headphone controls,"[Label(name=""feature"")]","```
Hi there,

Fantastic project, keep up the great work. On a daily basis, I use my HTC One M7 with
a Dell bluetooth headset bh200 (fairly generic bluetooth headphones).

I use Squeeze Player and Squeezer on my daily walk to work. It would be great if the
volume control buttons, play/pause and next/previous track buttons would work. If i
press them, the google music app kicks in.

I use these headphones for answering calls. Although Squeezer pauses music when a call
comes in, would love to see it resume when the call ends.

As ever, if there's anything I can assist you with on this project, please let me know
and I will try in assist.

Sincerely,
Ross Cullen

Hi,

instead of having a small button on playlist items (for tasks like play, download,
move, etc.) with a size even not really recognizable it would be IMHO much better to
use the whole playlist entry as button.
Therefore it would not happen anymore that a playlist entry accidentally is played,
when the button is missed.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,open,Set a default player in settings,[],"```
Hi,

it would be nice if I could configure a default player in the settings. This player
should be chosen automatically on app start up, if it is available.

Situation is as follows:
With my living room tablet I usually want to control my living room stereo, not the
bath room nor the kitchen player or anything else. Squeezer AFAIK remembers the last
chosen player, but not if the player was shut down in the mean time. So if I power
of my living room stereo the player changes to another player and I always have to
change it myself again.

""""""
Have you looked at any integration with Pebble and it's Music Boss app? I've found
it frustrating not being able to get this to work well with the Android Squeeze Commander
app as there's no way to get the track playing info over to the Pebble and it doesn't
respond to media buttons. Squeezer doesn't respond to media buttons either but the
fact that it puts info into the notification bar is helpful as Music Boss does have
a feature which allows it to display information from there. Attached is a screenshot
of the result. It would be really useful if it was possible to configure the information
Squeezer put into the notification. As you can see 'Nexus 5 playing' isn't really what
I want to see and it would be better if that was the track name and where the track
name currently is was the artist name. ï»¿

Hello,

COuld this be possible to add a ""follow me"" icon on the players linked with NFC capabilities

Exemple : you put one NFC tag per room. On the settings, you associate an NFC tag with
a room. 
You choose your music on a player (Living room, for instance). You then touch the ""follow
me"" icon of the living room. Your phone knows that you are in the living room and what
music you are listening to. When you move from the living room to the bedroom, you
just need to touch the bedroom NFC tag with your phone to have the living room music
following you in the bed room while the living room music pauses.

No one is implementing this. Is it Too tricky ? I would greatly appreciate this feature.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,closed,Setting: Add to playlist instead of clear playlist and play selecetd album/song,[],"```
Kinda like a ""partymode setting""; a setting where you would choose the default behavior
when pressing an album or song. 
3 settings possible: 1) Play now, 2) add to playlist, 3) play next. 

Reason: Many people to a party that always clears the current playlist can be very
annoying. I know that it is possible by pressing long on a number/song, but that can
be hard when people have gotten their first three tequilas... 

Thanks a lot in advance!

Make it more tablet friendly rather than phone specific. I.e., make use of a 10"" screen!
For example:

Have an option to show albums in an artwork grid view rather than a list. Should apply
both when view all albums and when viewing albums of a given artist. Having an optional
subtitle beneath each image would be useful - album name, maybe artist name too.

Have an option for large font sizes in 'now playing' page. On a tablet, you get a huge
blown up artwork image and a teeny tiny set of play controls in the top right corner.
Having larger text and buttons would look much less disproportionate and be easy to
use.

Have a permanently on-screen alphabet in the artist and album views so you can immediately
jump to the section starting with that letter.

Should return to same position in scroll list when hitting back button rather than
always resetting to the start. E.g. scroll half way through artist list, select someone,
view albums, hit return, now you are right back to the start and have to scroll through
again.

Have a permanently on-screen set of transport controls (play/pause, skip next/previous
+ song name).

When browsing by album name (whether the top level 'albums' list, the 'new music' list
or when browsing albums for a given artist) have a set of play buttons on the far right
of the menu item (play - replace current playlist, plus - add to end of playlist, next
- add to playlist as next entry. And instead of playing the album when touched, open
the album to view the song list. The current play when touched is incredibly annoying!
I keep loosing my current playlist when I'm just trying to browse my library. If play
buttons are technically possible then at least just making the default touch action
be to open the album and the replace current playlist action must be selected from
the long touch menu would be more consistent with other selection lists.

A set of play buttons when browsing all other lists would nice too (artist, song, genre,
etc.).

My request: I've got my Squeezebox and Server both set up to list albums in Artist/Year/Album

Hi,

I just manually installed the 0.1 version my G1, which works but then I saw
that the 0.4 version is already in the market. However, when I try to
install that one I get the following message:

""Installation error. Pacakge file was not signed correctly.""

I'm running firmware 1.6 (donut) on my HTC G1 Google Devphone.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,closed,Connection management,[],"This branch contains a few enhancements on connection to an LMS, somewhat related to [Pull out connection management code from NowPlayingFragment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VtsaJ-ZjGfTHZct3fcvnbuy1WdCizjj92ZJlBFA7eCE/edit#heading=h.qijb22lq4spq)
1. Scan server on disconnect
   Disconnected activity show the server address view, which scans for servers on
   the local network, and allows the user to reconnect to another server without
   going through settings.
2. Use disconnected activity on no configured server
   instead of showing a dialog the first time the user opens the app.
3. Show disconnected activity on login failure
   with an additional informational header explaining the issue, and a link to an
   alert dialog which explains how to check the server settings.
   If the server disconnects before the handshake is completed, it was interpreted
   as an authentification failure. If the server connects but then disconnects for
   some other reason before authentication is done, Squeezer would wrongly ask for
   authentication. This happens e.g. if you enter the web interface port instead
   of the CLI port.
   The disconnected activity (via the server address view) gives the possibility
   to change all the connection parameters, and the informational tekst does not
   assume that it is an authentication failure.

All other are also on the develop branch.

Do not use AIDL for the service as recommended here http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html and here http://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html

Refactored to be able to distinguish replies for items for download and items for display. Register the callback in the request instead in onResume, and use the correlation id from the request to correctly correlate the replies. Also use this  correlation id to cancel requests when a client unregisters.

Download manager has some issues. Not all file/folder names are supported so we use an sqlite database to store the current downloads, see the commit and commit comments for details. Also the download UI doesn't handle it well when many download are active, so the Squeezer downloads are not visible in the download UI.

There are still some issues with the download manager when many downloads are pending. The downloads are there, but the notification is not shown. For users who have their LMS on a private network, there is also the problem that downloads will not be able to complete, when not an that specific network. But download manager does not know that, so it keeps trying, eventually draining the battery. This is happens at least when there are many active downloads. To fix those issues we could utilize the fact, that we have a database with the requested downloads, so instead of passing them all to the download manager straight away, pass them sequentially to the download manager, passing the next one when a download completes.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,closed,Bugsense,[],"Fixes for the ""beginBroadcast() called while already in a broadcast"" crashes.

According to the documentation ""Note that only one broadcast can be active at a time, so you must be sure to always call this from the same thread"", all broadcasts should be done from the same thread.

While I haven't been able to trigger ANY crashes we do call beginBroadcast from both the listening thread and the main thread.

The first commit fixes the updatePlayerSubscriptionState method which was called from onResume/onPause. The method didn't actually do any broadcast, but called beginBroadcast to get the number of clients interested in second to second updates. Instead I keep track of the number of clients, so it's no longer necessary to call beginBroadcast.

While at it, I removed the requirement that scrobling turns on second to second updates, because we already receive (and handle) these events via the notifications enabled by the listen command. Mind you, it won't make any difference, because the now playing fragment is on any activity, and it always requires second to second updates, even if they are only used when the fragment is full height.

The second commit is more problematic. The user can change the active player (from the ui thread), which triggers a callback (onPlayerChanged) via beginBroadcast. While it seems more unlikely for this to happen at the same we receive an input event, eventually it will occur, so I guess it has to be fixed. The same applies to ConnectionState.setConnectionState which may be initiated by via user via disconnect, and by the listening thread when the socket disconects.

The solution in this commit, is to have the executor run all broadcasts. While this seems like a good design at first glimpse, because it frees up the listening thread to process more messages, multiple requests are now queued up in the executor where as previously in the input thread, essentially the same. Furthermore it complicates the code a bit, and introduces an overhead.

nikclayton/android-squeezer,closed,Danish translations for configurable action on selection of albums and songs,[],"I provided Danish localisation for this, to use when merging to the actionbar branch.

While translating this, I noticed that we already have strings for similar actions in the context menus. I ended using the exact same texts as:

CONTEXTMENU_BROWSE_SONGS
CONTEXTMENU_PLAY_ITEM
CONTEXTMENU_ADD_ITEM
CONTEXTMENU_INSERT_ITEM

Which suggests that we use those for the PlayableItemAction.Type.labelId

Another option is to use server strings (which are available on the actionbar branch). PLAY_NEXT, PLAY_NOW, ADD_TO_END, ?. This seems a bit more risky as we increase the dependency on the server version, and also I don't particularly like those texts.

What do you think?
