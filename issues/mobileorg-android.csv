1. I setup the emacs config with the 3 setq's: org-directory, org-mobile-inbox-for-pull, and org-mobile-directory, and did an org-mobile-push. I note that the documentation claims MobileOrg will create a directory inside Dropbox, but it does not. So I created a MobileOrg directory inside Dropbox, then did the push.

Sure enough, 3 files get created in that directory: checksum.dat, index.org, and mobileorg.org. But none of these files contain anything like the org files in my ~/org directory. Why?
1. I downloaded the app through the Play store, and went through the Setup Wizard. I successfully got an authorization for Dropbox, and picked ~/MobileOrg as the sync directory.

Now it's done with the setup. The documentation's images are apparently broken, so no way to tell what the main screen is supposed to look like. But the top bar looks like a + on the extreme right side, then a sync circle with 2 arrows, then a third thing which is a ""sync-ing"" circle which won't stop trying to sync.

I hit the synchronize button, and now the third circle disappears. I think it sync'ed, but the screen is the same.

Now what? If I go to Outline, nothing happens. If I go to Agenda, it's blank. Search doesn't work.

matburt/mobileorg-android,open,Heading dropdown menus not working on certain distributions of Android,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""UI"")]","Navigate to any heading in outline.  Click capture button.  Currently selected heading flashes briefly in dropdown on capture screen, but then disappears.  Capture button seems to ignore context regardless of where you are in the outline when it is clicked.  User must reselect the heading path from the dropdowns on capture screen.

For example, try to edit
Heading1 > Subheading1 > SubSubHeading1

On Nexus 7 and LG G2, dropdowns display
- Heading1
- Subheading1
- SubSubHeading1

On Galaxy Note 3 and Motorola Bionic, dropdowns only display
- Heading1
- empty
- empty

This makes it very difficult to add new outline nodes.

Reproduced in 0.9.8, 0.9.12, and 0.9.13.

Issue tested and occurring on following devices:
Moto Droid Bionic, Android 4.1.2
Galaxy Note 3, Android 4.3

Using exact same version of mobileorg, problem does not occur on these devices:
Nexus 7, Android 4.3
LG G2, Android 4.2.2

matburt/mobileorg-android,open,Link from agenda views to entries in org-files,"[Label(name=""UI"")]","It would be convenient to be able to jump from an agenda-view item to its location in the corresponding org-file within MobileOrg.  This would allow the item to be modified as needed, so that syncing would work properly.

In fact, a good idea that would obviate the need for the above is to make it so that MobileOrg builds its own internal representation of the agendas.org file, where each agenda-view entry is linked to the ""actual"" entry in the database that is used to represent the entry in the original org file's tree.  This way, modifying an entry in agendas.org will be equivalent to modifying the entry in it's true location, and vice versa.

Since the 'intelligence' in building agenda-views is currently on the emacs side, this means that it could be that an agenda-view's search criterion no longer fits an updated entry, but I that doesn't seem like a big drawback in comparison with the benefits.

Hello matburt, thanks for an awesome app, I use it every day.

Here is a small contribution that I did not see in any open issue.

@matburt Would you be willing to change the build system? You would need to edit the MobileOrg/build.gradle with accordance to http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Signing-Configurations I created a signing config called matburt that you just need to fill out. Creating the donate and release versions is done by running ./gradlew assembleRelease or ./gradlew assembleDonate.

matburt/mobileorg-android,open,Spaces not allowed in filenames when syncing,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Sync"")]","I tried syncing a file called ""Actions and Calendar.txt"" through emacs to mobileorg. The hash-file and everything looks fine in the folder on dropbox, but the android-client cannot find the file. (The error message gives a Dropbox 404 error)

Removing the spaces in the filename fixes the issues. But that might not be the best longterm solution for this software.

Just a heads up. I'm certain this is an easy fix for someone who is familiar with the code.

Cheers!

matburt/mobileorg-android,open,Support newer versions of Android Calendar API,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Calendar"")]","My tablet underwent an OS upgrade over the summer. Since then, org entries with timestamps/scheduled/deadlines do not synchronize to the Google calendar.

Steps to see the problem:
1. On the computer, org-mobile-push.
2. On the tablet, synchronize.
3. On the tablet, look at the calendar -- it's empty.
4. On the tablet, check an item in the outline view that I know is scheduled for a specific time. The schedule in the mobileorg interface is correct. So the dates are there, just not getting over to the calendar.

I noticed the problem in mobileorg 0.9.8. I've upgraded my tablet to 0.9.13 and the problem persists.

I suspect something changed in the calendar API and mobileorg hasn't adapted.

My tablet is an ASUS transformer pad TF300T.

Android 4.2.1
Kernel version 3.1.10-g890b05a android@Taurus #1 Thu Jul 11 17:55:00 CST 2013

Calendar app version 4.2.1-US_epad-10.6.1.27.1-20130711

I manage my calendar entries exclusively using org, and use the tablet's calendar only as a viewer. I'm not using the feature to capture Google calendar entries into org.

1. In emacs orgmode, construct a new one-line outline(ex. Personal.org) like this(please ignore the surrounding double-quotes):

2. In emacs orgmode, run org-mobile-push, ok.
3. In Mobileorg, clean the DataBase first and then push ""Sync"" button. OK, can see the org file now.
4. Edit the todo item, by adding a deadline, such as 2013-08-14.
5. Push ""Sync"" button again.
6. In Emacs, run org-mobile-pull. And gets 1 error. And this is the content in the inbox:

Still: the save button no longer has the benefit of being so easy to reach, and now has the additional problem that if you try to slide your finger onto it from the top edge, and miss by ten pixels or so, you end up canceling out. Before the addition of the menu button, this wasn't an issue, because you could slide onto Save from the top-right corner, such that you'd have to rub Save before you could get to Cancel
Ways to solve off the top of my head

On Android there seems to be not way to permanently mount an SMB drive so one cannot just use the sync to ""my SD-CARD"" option and sync that partition eg with rsync with the SMB drive. So adding a SMB option to MobileOrg would fill this gap.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Cannot select index.org on MicroSD,[],"I experienced problems with MobileOrg 0.9.7 on a Sony Xperia sola with Android 4.0.4 when trying to setup synchronization via SD card: Even though all needed files are on my MicroSD card in subfolder org/, which I could access without problems, I could neither see nor select any org file and hence was unable to import index.org [no files shown in directory, Done button greyed out]. MobileOrgNG 0.0.4 worked without problems on the same device with the same card: I set synchronisation mode to SD card, selected the index.org file and it imported my agenda files successfully.

All files in the subfolder have been created in Emacs: I set org mobile directory and mobile inbox for pull and then pushed files and views onto the MicroSD card. The bug forces me to use MobileOrgNG for now - I will come back as soon as it's fixed.

PS:
Offtopic, but if there is no way to clock into and out of tasks I would really appreciate adding it at some point. Haven't come across this functionality, yet. On the other hand, it's very early and I haven't had time to play with the program in depth, yet, so I might have missed it.

matburt/mobileorg-android,open,Usability: Node editor scrolling vs onscreen keyboard,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""UI"")]","Here's a usability issue that crops up when you have an entry whose payload is short enough so that the entire node editor fits on one screen, but long enough to extend into the screen area occupied by the android keyboard.

It seems that MobileOrg decides how much scrolling is possible based on the entire screen's height even if the keyboard is visible. In that case, part of the screen is unavailable for viewing and editing text. So it makes sense that you should be able to:
- scroll down so that the bottom of the editor is visible above the top of the keyboard, and
- scroll up so that the top of the window is visible.

(Scroll up meaning show what is above, akin to grabbing the scroll handle in a mouse-driven system and pushing it up.)

I've had problems with both of these. Scrolling down, it seems like MobileOrg decides that the editor's bottom fits on screen, never mind that the keyboard hides part of it. If I want to edit text in that bottom part, I have to hide the keyboard, then tap in the text -- Android pops up the keyboard and this scrolls the window. Scrolling up, if the window's bottom edge is not actually off screen (it's hidden under the keyboard), scrolling just doesn't happen.

The worst impact is on my Asus tablet, running jelly bean. The cut/copy buttons appear in a ribbon at the window's top. So this sequence happens to me _all the time_:
- I want to copy some text near the bottom of one of these payloads. So I tap and hold on one of the words to select it.
- Android thinks I'm editing text, so it pops up the keyboard, scrolling the window.
- Now cut/copy/paste have scrolled past the top of the screen. So I try to pull the visible display downward to reveal the top.
- MobileOrg decides the view should have all fit on one screen anyway, so it refuses to scroll.
- Dismissing the keyboard reveals the window top, but also cancels the selection, so I still can't copy.

The editing thing is ungraceful, but I can live with it. Breaking copy/paste is a major interface flaw. But, maybe a simple fix, if the problem is just that raising the keyboard alters the screen geometry but MobileOrg doesn't recognize that fact.

This does not occur in other apps. I'm writing this in the android github app, and I _can_ scroll the issue editor in both ways mentioned above, with the keyboard visible. So I'm fairly convinced that MobileOrg is ignoring a signal from the OS.

This occurs in all MobileOrg versions I've used. I'm currently on the latest from Google Play.

If it isn't clear what I mean by this, I can provide screenshots.

What this would be is a way to quickly tag/mark several different headlines (at different depths), and have these all show up at the same level in a ""quick list"".  So the idea would be that you can indicate ""I want this headline to be visible in quick-list #1"" for various headlines.  Then when you want to view them all at once, just drill down into a virtual ""quick-lists"" headline, and choose quick-list 1, under which you would see all of the headlines you had indicated you wanted to appear there.

There are several uses for something like this -- now maybe you'd say this can be accomplished by just using org-mode tags, and having a way of setting up views based on tags -- that could work also, but the main thing would be that it's very easy to _quickly_ tag headlines, and that the tagged headlines all appear on the same level in the quick-list.

It should also be possible to ""clear"" a quick-list, which just removes the list's corresponding tag / indicator from every headline that was in the quick-list.  And, also to be able to quickly remove individual headlines from a quick-list while viewing the quick-list.

This is the sort of thing that could lead one to cancel when one meant to save. That's bad.

I would prefer to reorder the main save/cancel buttons for the whole entry, on the grounds that I'll be hitting Save more often than Cancel; therefore, Save should be in the most accessible position; and that position is the corner of the screen. I can find the corner of the device by touch, and roll my thumb inward from there, and be fairly confident of hitting the corner of the screen, even if I'm not really looking at it.

My org-agenda-files is setup: 

```
(setq org-agenda-files '(""~/shoebox/read/org/work.gpg"" ""~/shoebox/read/org/mashdot.org""))

```
(setq org-mobile-agendas '(""m""))

'(
(""m"" ""mashdot"" alltodo """"
((org-agenda-files '(""~/shoebox/read/org/mashdot.org""))

Although the ""agenda.org"" file is created correctly containing only my custom agenda (""m""); mobile-org still pushes up my ""work.gpg"" file causing a Decrypt Message dialogue box to appear but fail to decrypt. _Now I assume this is not part of mobile-org but rather APG on Android. De/Encryption would be a handy addition if this is not already implemented._

Simply I am wanting to know if it is possible to limit which files are pushed up via ""org-mobile-push"". I had thought that ""org-mobile-agendas"" would control this.

"
matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,handling org-class items and syncing them to calendar,[],"I'm using org-mode for organizing my university courses. There's a very handy function called org-class which allows to pass start and end date of a course and a list of weeks (e.g. 'holidays) where it doesn't take place. It's described in the [org-mode faq](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#org-class).
My courses show up perfectly in the mobileorg agenda view but are not being synced to the calendar.
Another aspect of the org-class function is the day of time can't be a part of the timestamp itself but has to be in the headline or after the timestamp, e.g.:

<pre><code>
* lectures
** Analysis 2 8:00-10:00
   &lt;%%(org-class 2012 10 25 2013 2 16 4 'holidays)&gt;
</code></pre>


In Emacs the time of day is displayed as normal in the agenda view. It would be really cool if mobileorg will be able to handle this special case too.

Thank you for your great work.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Strange behavior in Win7 64 bit with Org-Mobile-Pull / Push,[],"Perhaps this is an emacs configuration error but not being an expert in configuring Emacs, this was my first stop. 

The behavior is that after an org-mobile-pull,  the current buffer does not get updated with the changes applied by the pull. If I use the File>Revert buffer command, the changes from the pull are there. This is a problem however if I had unsaved changes in the buffer before I started the process.  In order for this to work predictably every time, I need to be sure to save changes in current buffer, run org-mobile-pull, revert buffer manually if changes do not show up. By the way, using Emacs in Ubuntu on my home computers, I have never had to do this and the whole thing works as intended beautifully. 

One other note... after issuing org-mobile-push, the folding of the file gets changed and I typically need to do a global collapse all to regain any sanity. 

Using:
GNU Emacs 23.3.1 (i386-mingw-nt6.1.7601) of 2011-03-10 on 3249CTO
Org-mode version 6.33x

Any help will be appreciated. Also if this is more appropriate to post on the Org-mode mailing list, let me know.  I really need this to work correctly as I have come to really depend on this workflow.  I am on the verge of running an Ubuntu VM just to have my org-mode workflow work correctly. ;)

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,"Can't see descriptive names of agendas under ""Agenda Views""",[],"I'm unsure if this is an issue with the way org-mobile-\* functions format the agendas.org file, or with the way MobileOrg-Android is parsing the agendas file.

Anyway... I have, for example, agenda custom commands like this:

```
(""z"" ""Grading"" tags-todo ""+Grading"" nil)
(""1"" ""Fall semester TODOs"" alltodo """" ((org-agenda-files (quote (""~/Documents/mobileorg/semester.org""))) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy (quote (user-defined-up)))))
```

And I would hope, in MobileOrg, to go into Agenda Views and see the descriptive names:

```
Grading
Fall semester TODOs
...
```

Instead, MobileOrg presents a user-unfriendly list of the technical definitions of the agenda views:

```
Match: +Grading
ToDo: ALL
```

""Match: +Grading"" is only mildly irritating -- extra visual clutter that I don't particularly need to see at that point and, in case the search criteria are extremely complex, don't fit on the limited phone screen anyway. ""ToDo: ALL"" quickly becomes useless if you have more than one (separating TODOs into different files, e.g.). Imagine seeing this, if you have a lot of alltodo searches.

```
ToDo: ALL
ToDo: ALL
ToDo: ALL
ToDo: ALL
ToDo: ALL
ToDo: ALL
```

The descriptive titles do exist in agendas.org. Would it be possible for MobileOrg to use them?

```
* Match: +Grading<after>KEYS=z TITLE: Grading</after>
* ToDo: ALL<after>KEYS=1 TITLE: Spring semester TODOs</after>
```

I see issue #217 but I think this is a slightly different issue. That user seemed to want to see all of the criteria under Agenda Views (and the issue there was that they were displayed incorrectly). I don't want to see the criteria at all, only the descriptive names (which, for me, are completely hidden).

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Fault tolerance: Multiple mobile devices syncing to the same computer,[],"Currently, MobileOrg uses a hardcoded filename - mobileorg.org - to store the user's edits on the mobile device. If the user has two or more devices, it's very easy to lose data this way:
1. Edit something on one mobile device and sync.
2. Edit something else on another mobile device and sync.

Now, the changes from the first device, which were put into mobileorg.org, got trashed when the second device overwrote mobileorg.org.

Sure, the user ""should"" sync on one device, then pull on the computer before syncing on the other device. But I think the software should be a bit more robust vis-à-vis user carelessness.

Also note, this issue means that auto-sync is disastrous if you have multiple devices.

For instance, each mobile device could have a unique ID and append that ID to the filename (before the extension). This means that org-mobile-pull would have to change to look at files matching mobileorg*.org instead of just one file, but that shouldn't be a difficult change either.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Fault tolerance: Don't erase captures and edits until we are sure they have been uploaded,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Related issue: https://github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/issues/184

That issue is to prevent sync when the network connection is not available. However, this issue is a little broader. The network connection may be available, but transferring captures and edits to the dropbox/Ubuntu one/webdav server may fail for any number of reasons. Currently, MobileOrg sync doesn't care whether it worked or not. It just wipes out the captures, causing data loss for the user.

The best approach I can think of is to add an SHA ID to every captured/edited node (exactly like org-mobile-push does for TODOs and scheduled/deadline items), and transfer this to the sandbox during sync. _It would not delete anything at this point._ The user should copy new nodes into the desired org file along with the SHA. Then, after the user pushes from Emacs and resyncs on the mobile device, MobileOrg would detect that there is a capture/edit with the same ID and only at that point would it delete the entry. Then there is no chance of data loss -- MobileOrg would not delete anything without confirmation that the data went over to the other side correctly, by getting the same ID back on a subsequent sync.

Short of that, at least be sure that there was no error during transfer.
"
matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Fault tolerance: Retry if file doesn't up or download within a time limit,[],"I am watching MobileOrg _not_ syncing because it's stuck ""Downloading checksums.dat."" I'm afraid this will be a fairly typical situation for me. In mainland China, it happens often -- often -- that some packet doesn't get through and the transfer freezes. The only way to transfer a file, or load the rest of the webpage, or finish syncing my e-mail or whatever is to stop and retry.

MobileOrg doesn't have a stop/retry button anywhere. Even killing MobileOrg using Advanced Task Killer doesn't stop the transfer.

For fun, I just tried hitting the sync button again, and it did retry. I'm not sure if this will be consistent behavior.

In any case, it might be nice to have an option to tell MobileOrg, if a file transfer fails to complete within 30 or 60 seconds, stop that transfer and try again. We can't assume the network connection will always be reliable and that, just because we asked for the file from dropbox, ubuntu one or wherever, that it will necessarily come down without further action by MobileOrg.

gives the following heading in the file-list in mobile-org:

```
Mixed
```

instead of:

```
Mixed activities/todo.txt
```

Removing the space in the path (giving Mixedactivities) gives the correct behavouir.

One day I was in a meeting taking notes and input stopped when I hit 9000
chars. So I saved the note and made a new one, then later merged the two
on my desktop. When I synced that back to MobileOrg, I got a crash when I
tried to view the 12K note. This patch seems to fix the crash and also
the input restriction.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,"captured items don't ""pull""",[],"I have been having a couple of problems with mobileorg. Both have
appeared recently in the development; they were not a problem in
earlier versions. I am submitting two separate bug reports, but
attaching the same aLogcat file to each.

The second bug showed up at about version 0.8.5. Suddenly, captures or
edits to existing nodes were not being seen by emacs when doing a
pull. I knew I have made edits, but emacs pull reported ""No new
items"". For the attached aLogcat file, I did a push, created a new
node entitled ""TEST"", and edited a node to include the word ""TEST"" in
the ""payload"". Then I synced mobileorg, attached to the PC, and did a
pull.

Strange thing - there was no ""agenda.org"" in the folder when I opened
it up through the PC.

I sync using a folder.
By the way, the device is a Archos 32, firmware version 2.4.83 (Android 2.2.1)

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Files missing from Agenda View list,[],"I have been having a couple of problems with mobileorg. Both have
appeared recently in the development; they were not a problem in
earlier versions. I am submitting two separate bug reports, but
attaching the same aLogcat file to each.

The first bug showed up at about version 0.7. Suddenly, I did not get
the usual list in ""Outline View"". I used to get an ""Agenda Views""
button, and one button for each of my .org files, just like it shows
in the ""Basic Usage"" part of
https://github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/wiki/Documentation. Now,
it just shows the ""Agenda Views"" button. I have tried a couple of
things in relation to this. I have rearranged the order of the files at
the end of the index.org file; this has not effect. I have deleted the
- [[file:agendas.org][Agenda Views]] 

line from the index.org file; this results in, again, only the agenda
views button being shown, but this time it is labeled ""agendas.org""
instead of ""Agenda Views"". I have also tried uninstalling mobileorg completly and reinstalling.

I have attached my index.org file.

By the way, the device is a Archos 32, firmware version 2.4.83 (Android 2.2.1)

index.org:

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Timestamp in Heading not synced with calendar,[],"A heading like
- Go to airport <2012-06-14 14:00>

Does not get synced to the phone's calendar.  Instead, only timestamps in the payload are parsed.

So this works:
- Go to airport
  
  <2012-06-14 14:00>

Because the Org manual leads one to believe that putting the timestamp in the heading is the normal way
to schedule a simple appointment, many appointments of users following the manual will get silently ignored.

Thanks to Henning for answering my question on the goggle groups for mobileorg-android.

Count this as a bug, or at least a strong wish.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Calendar Sync: Plain Timestamps Should be Treated as Appointments,[],"Matt,

Incredible improvements to MobileOrg.  Many thanks for your work on this.

I have been using gcaldaemon to sync my org file calendar items with my phone and am anxious to switch over to MobileOrg for all my syncing needs.  But one obvious thing seems to be missing.  If I understand org's notion of setting appointments correctly, any headline with a timestamp should be treated as an appointment (unless it's an inactive timestamp in [square brackets]).  See 8.1 of the Org Mode Manual.  The DEADLINE and SCHEDULED items are for something different.  DEADLINE to give you several days warning of an upcoming deadline (default 14 days) and SCHEDULED to suggest a time to _start_ working on a TODO item and warn you when its past without being done. See 8.3 of the Org Mode Manual.

But a run-of-the-mill appointment is just an ordinary headline with a timestamp---which should be most appointments.  As it stands now, though, MobileOrg ignores these, but syncs the DEADLINE and SCHEDULEed items with the phone calendar as though they were appointments.

Am I missing something?  If not consider this a request to cause plain timestamps to be synced to the calendar as an appointment, either for a particular time (if it has one) or just as a day-based item if it doesn't.  Ideally, a DEADLINE would cause a warning to show up n days before the date hits, and SCHEDULED would show up n days after the   date hits unless it's a TODO that's been marked done, just like in the Agenda in org mode.

Regards,

    http://some_link_here/  
```

The issue is that the link is not clickable in mobileorg.  Prior to the UI changes I was able to click links and had a snappy way of reading stuff.  Now i have to highlight the link and copy it, and Androids f'ing copy/paste is something I can do without. In the latest release the links are not highlighted/clickable.  I do not believe I changed anything in my configuration, but if that were to matter it is below:

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Appointment timestamps and Google calendar sync,[],"Finally, got mobile-org 0.8.4 working on my Galaxy Nexus with ICS. Thanks for the effort on this!

The main issue at this point: mobile-org seems to only handle DEADLINE and SCHEDULED timestamps. But the problem is that calendars typically have many events/appointments and these are not entered in org-mode with either of these tags.

As the org-mode documentation says:

""Scheduling an item in Org mode should not be understood in the same way that we understand scheduling a meeting. Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown on the date where it applies.""
http://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-scheduling.html#Deadlines-and-scheduling

I hope I have misunderstood something about mobile-org and there is an easy fix. Otherwise, at this point I am not sure how to get my events/appointments into Google calendar via mobile-org (other than adding one of those two tags, which I really do not want to do).

Suggestions?

At first, I thought this was a recurrence of [52](https://github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/issues/52), but then I added an agendas.org file link to my index.org, and the bug continued. It would sync if agendas.org was the _only_ link in index.org, though.

logcat is regrettably unhelpful. I see some normal looking ""getting"" and ""fetching"" messages--no ""sync failed"" message here; that only shows up in the notification tray. There's also this other thing that shows up in the middle of a sync:

```

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Synchronizing resets TODO states,[],"Version: 0.62
Phone: HTC Desire
Android Version: 2.2

Problem: When I track my tasks with TODO states, these changes are resetted if I synchronize with Dropbox. When I synchronize with Emacs, the states are ok.

Example (to reproduce the error):
1. Create some task e.g.
- TODO Test Task
- Synchronize using org-mobile-push in Emacs
- Mark Task as done, at the Android appl e.g.
- DONE Test Task
- Click ""Synchronize"" in the Android App, now the task is again shown as TODO:
- TODO Test Task
- Synchronize using org-mobile-pull in Emacs, now the task is DONE on Emacs:
- DONE Test Task
- Synchronize using org-mobile-push in Emacs, now the task is already DONE at the droid:
- DONE Test Task

I expected that the task will be shown as DONE after step 3 and will not reset to TODO anymore. I looked into the file mobileorg.org there the change from TODO to DONE is staged correctly. It seems that the problem is, that MobileOrg does not recognise the staged changes when showing the task list.

I think this is a regression after moving from 0.61 to 0.62, but I am not completely sure because I did not use the version 0.61 very much.

Todo:
- Use XML text strings for internationalization
- Create icons for different resolutions
- Implement the other sync sources, of course!

To use the wizard, you'll need to delete the application data from the Android Settings.

Additionally it's not just memory which is affected, but also the CPU which has to context switch between all these processes - and most of us are not lucky enough to have dual-core phones yet.

Therefore I would request that MobileOrg be one of the (sadly few) responsible citizens of the Android VM world, and ensure that it does not run unless it really needs to.  I hope that this request is reasonable and makes sense.  Thanks for listening!

But if I capture a new note, and then decide to edit it, latter sync process would fail.
org-mobile-pull will fail with an error:
org-mobile-pull: Wrong type argument: char-or-string-p, nil

Reproducible: always.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Capture a note in MobileOrg, e.g. ""New note.""
2. Go to ""New notes"".
3. Edit a note in MobileOrg. For instance, I've changed title to ""New note. edited.""
4. Do ""sync"" in mobileorg.
5. Plug droid device to PC.
6. Do ""org-mobile-pull"" in Emacs.
7. Emacs would reply ""Wrong type argument: char-or-string-p, nil"".

The bad news is that all the captured and edited notes would be ignored. Emacs just would remove its from mobileorg.org to from-mobile.org. All edited notes would not be edited in emacs org files and all changed flags would not be changed. After that one should examine from-mobile.org and do all editing by hand.

I've digged this problem for some time and have these observations.
1. If I edit only existing notes (both edit titles, bodies and change flags), everything would be OK.
2. If I edit just one newly captured note (regardless to the number of edited existing notes), sync would fail.

The difference is quite simple. All the existing notes have ""ID"" property. When in MobileOrg I change these notes, MobileOrg places them to mobileorg.org with reference by this ID.
But all newly captured notes doesn't have ""ID"" property. MobileOrg makes a link in another form. For the example I have written before, mobileorg.org contain:
- New note.

came out only when I started to use MobileOrg, and didn't caused any problems in
org-mode itself. I sure I'm not the last faced this problem when started using
MobileOrg. So I decided to write about this here.
I had some problem with the way MobileOrg display TODO states.
There are several TODO states defined in my org files. This is done by including
this line to org file:
# +SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) MAYBE(m) WAITING(w) APPT(a) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c) DEFERRED(f)

The tags from the first part needs some actions and should be displayed in red while
the tags from the second doesn't assume any actions and should be displayed in
green. 
In MobileOrg ""CANCELLED"" and ""DEFERRED"" where green but ""DONE"" was red. Another
thing - in MobileOrg the list of the possible TODO states contained two DONE items,
all other items were listed only once. 
Having examined the index.org file, which was generated for MobileOrg, I saw two lines:
# +TODO: TODO DONE
# +TODO: MAYBE WAITING APPT | DONE CANCELLED DEFERRED

So, that was a problem. The first line contains default TODO types, which are defined in
org-todo-keywords (org.el). The second line contains my custom TODO
types. This is a problem of defailt org-mode settings. 
org-mobile.el (in function org-mobile-create-index-file) write default
TODO types in first line. Then it excludes default types from my custom list and
writes the rest to the second line.
As default, the value of org-todo keywords is ((sequence ""TODO"" ""DONE"")). So,
org-mobile.el have no way to determine which of these to types need some action
and which doesn't need. This information could be obtained from my custom string
""+SEQ_TODO"", but org-mobile-create-index-file ignores it. It would be better to
write all the custom TODO types in the first line. In the second line should be
default values except for the same as custom. The modification of org-mobile.el
is needed.
I could suggest another solution without org-mobile.el modification. I simply set
the value of org-todo-keywords to nil in my ~/.emacs. Now I have only one record in
index.org:
# +TODO: TODO MAYBE WAITING APPT | DONE CANCELLED DEFERRED

This have solved my problem and now ""DONE"" is displayed in green in MobileOrg.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,"Changed how payload in root nodes is displayed, added a check for files that are in db but not index.org",[],"One showstopper for me when I started using the app is that I tend to put information (the node ""payloads"" in mobileorg-android terminology) outside the heading, hierarchy, e.g.:
# +TITLE: My Notes

- Heading 1
  ---> Here's some text that's the payload for heading 1 <--- 
  *\* Heading 2

Lines marked with -->  <-- weren't previously displayed in the app, so I wrote a quick fix to create nodes for them.  In the future, those nodes (if we stick with this solution) should be specially marked to indicate they are not ""true"" nodes.

I also ran into an NPE bug caused by the appdb and index.org being out of sync, leading the app to try and fetch/parse nonexistent files.  I added a check that removes files from appdb if they don't appear in index.org.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Trouble syncing,[],"Hi,

Just getting into org-mode and was delighted to find this Android app.

I'm having some trouble getting things to sync over Dropbox though.

In my ~/.emacs I have the following....

;; Org-mode
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(""\.org$"" . org-mode))
(global-set-key ""\C-cl"" 'org-store-link)

;;; Include all org files
(setq org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards ""~/Dropbox/org/*.org""))
;;; Set directory for pulling
(setq org-mobile-inbox-for-pull ""~/Dropbox/MobileOrg/"")

Under ~/Dropbox/org I have the following files...

$ ls -l ~/Dropbox/org
total 20
-rw-r--r-- 1 neil neil 860 May  9 09:52 climbing.org
-rw-r--r-- 1 neil neil   0 May  5 12:41 personal.org

-rw-r--r-- 1 neil neil 483 May  9 08:56 work.org~

I then open up one of these org files and push it to get the files staged (C-c C-x Return p) and am told ""File for mobile viewer staged"", so I take a peek inside ~/Dropbox/MobileOrg/ and index.org has been created...

$ cat ~/Dropbox/MobileOrg/index.org

...but there isn't an ""agendas.org"" file that should have been created.  As a consequence things don't sync, and from MobileOrg on my phone I'm told ""{""error"": ""File not found""} repeatedly.

I've tried restart emacs and staging again, and I'm informed that the files are staged, but still no agendas.org file appears, but all the other *.org files which I've wild-card included are present, waiting to be synced.

I'm guessing this is down to org-mode not creating things correctly, but the _Messages_ buffer reports...

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Duplicate Agenda View entry each sync,[],"Hello,

Trying to get the hang of mobileorg 0.5.4, storing files on sdcard (but same problem with 0.5.2).  Maybe I have a faulty setup?  Here is my .emacs stanza:

;; Set to the location of your Org files on your local system
(setq org-directory ""~/Dropbox/org"")
;; Set to <your Dropbox root directory>/MobileOrg.
(setq org-mobile-directory ""~/Dropbox/mobileorg/"")
(setq org-agenda-files (quote (""~/Dropbox/org/gtd.org"")))
;; Set to the name of the file where new notes will be stored
(setq org-mobile-inbox-for-pull ""~/Dropbox/org/inbox.org"")
(setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence ""TODO"" ""WAITING"" ""|"" ""DONE"" ""DELEGATED"" ""CANCELLED"")))

Running android 2.2 on Samsung Vibrant, emacsclient-snapshot on linux, dropbox staging directory.

First issue: When I do a manual sync, I get duplicate copies of Agenda Views and my todo items.  For example,  three manual syncs from phone gives:

Agenda Views > 
Week-Agenda (W18)
ToDo: ALL
Week-Agenda (W18)
ToDo: ALL
Week-Agenda (W18)
ToDo: ALL

Each ""ToDo:"" view has a complete copy of the TODO/DONE/CANCELLED items in my gtd.org file.  

Doing an org-mobile-pull from emacs shows a ""normal"" gtd.org file (it does not have multiple entries for each heading).

Related issue:

Phone: Click  gtd.org entry from main mobileorg screen.

Phone: Click on one of the TODO items, change state to CANCELLED, Save Note.

Item shows desired state: CANCELLED.

Manual Sync

Entry now reverts back to TODO! (laptop shows dropbox notification: mobileorg.org was updated)

Emacs: run org-mobile-pull.  Item's state /has/ been changed to CANCELLED in gtd.org, yet on phone still shows TODO.

Emacs: org-mobile-push.  Phone: perform manual sync.

Argh!  Now gtd.org on phone shows all items have been repeated (two sets!). In the first series, the item shows old state (TODO), in the second series, the item shows the new state (CANCELLED). 

Uinstall mobileorg, delete dropbox mobileorg directory, delete sdcard/mobileorg.  Reinstall mobileorg, and try again.  Reproducible results.

Sorry if I'm missing something obvious, here.
Thanks!

PS: What does the Menu > Outline button do?  Haven't figured that out yet...sorry I'm a newbie.

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,direct edit mode,[],"I guess iOS required the development of mobileorg due to lack of direct access to files on the device and hence the need for push, pull and webdav etc.  On android however, the sdcard can be directly mounted and any system can be used to access the files and to handle synchronisation issues.

I'd like to see a direct editing mode where the sdcard can be browsed and org files (or just txt files) can be edited directly and saved in place, without any need to push/pull/sync in the client and in emacs.  syncing can be handled externally if required in any way the user desires (e.g. with svn etc)

matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Wish: Alarms for Timed TODOs and Auto Sync,[],"Matt,

Thanks for your work on MobileOrg.

I would like to have my phone's alarm come on in advance of items with a time-of-day associated with them.  This would not be much good without being able to set an auto-sync period where Mobile does a sync, say, every 30 minutes.  So that too.

Org now has an ALARM property settable on TODO's that should be respected by MobileOrg.

People are doing all kinds of Rube Goldberg-ish things to try to use syncing with Google, which in turn syncs with the phone, but this doesn't really work well because the UID generated by Org is not resepected by Google.

Anyway, MobileOrg seems to me like the right way to go.

"
matburt/mobileorg-android,closed,Assumes valid org files have a .org extension,[],"I originally had all my notes in a file named ""NOTES"", listed in org-agenda-files and with `-*- mode: org; -*-` in the first line. The org manual mentions this approach, and org-mobile-push pushes the NOTES file correctly. But mobileorg-android only shows the ""Agenda Views"" file, which left me a little underwhelmed. Renaming NOTES to NOTES.org and pushing again actually makes my entire notes tree available on the android device. 

I'm assuming this is because the regexp in SDCardSynchronizer.getOrgFilesFromMaster matches only a handful of extensions. If that regexp cannot safely be made any looser it would be nice to document this restriction somewhere, since I really thought for a minute that mobileorg was _intentionally_ only showing me agenda and TODO items.
