gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,open,FBReader TTS+ plugin v3.7.2 does not work with FBReader > v2.7.14,[],"The FBReader TTS+ plugin v3.7.2 seems to be not working with FBReader versions higher than 2.7.14 (i.e. 2.7.15 and 2.8.x).  All previous updates caused no significant issues (I am using FBReader and the TTS+ plugin for almost three years).
Tested on a Jolla phone under AOSP 4.1.2."
gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,open,feature request: runn correctly in background,[],"when i switch apps the playback continues and i can bur still pause play using the button on the headset button, but it crashes very very fast. So it would be really grate if you would add some persistant notification that would let you easily switch back, a big problem because the last one in the list is fbreader tts not fbreader it self but it crashes when switching back to it but is still working if you switch to the main app, and would prevent the os from killing it while in playing pause mode. also you may also could fix that switching mechanism using the android buildin methode, maybe like its activity resume methode interface or whatever called will call not itself and crash but it's super methode (sure not inhabitants but i don't know that interface stuff at all because i can only write basic and barly a liittlle c (without any plusses or ecen worse some ms hashes)).

thanks a lot in advance, this would make this addon a perfectly working one and spare users of a lot of hazzle while trying to doing multitasking on that not as good fore os.

so thanks in advance and keep upthegoodwork"
gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,closed,Updated Japanese translation,[],
gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,open,req: wrong reading position / configurable prev / next jump units,[],"I am using latest FB Reader and TTS plus plugin on an LG G3 with Android 5.0 Lollipop.
Most likelly I've got a broken simple text file causing this behaviour. When this file is open in FB Reader running on my device it takes approx 830 FB Reader pages. I have used TTS plus to read first 220 pages. Of course I haven't read it all within a single reading session. The last reading session was so I have been reading from approx page 157 to page 220. I have rebooted my phone, started FB reader, it opened on page 220, then I went to the menu to start TTS plus. TTS plus has started reading from page 166. I can use prev / next buttons to move forward but If I close TTS plus and use FB Reader controls to adjust position after page 166 (e.g. navigation slider or when I swipe to the next page multiple times) TTS plus will always start reading from page 166. It will also update the book position accordingly.
I guess that it attempts to detect a previous section or something similar when starting reading aloud. Since I may have got a broken file here it might have issues finding section boundary on pages 167 to 220 thus it moves back to page 166 when I instruct it to read from page 220.
I do have the following feature requests in mind:
- Would it be possible to never skip back more than a single page when starting reading aloud eventhough it may not start with a proper section boundary?
- Would it be possible to configure how much prev / next buttons move within the document by? E.G. I would be happy if there was a switch so we can configure it to jump by sentences like it does currently and also jump by pages usefull in such an emergency situations like my current one.

Greetings

gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,open,No more update in Fdroid,[],"Hello,

Since FBReader TTS+ seems to use Dropbox API, it cannot be updated for the Fdroid repository.

Is there a way to compile FBReader TTS+ without these proprietary APIs ?

gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,closed,Sentence extraction for Hindi using old SentenceExtractor,[],"Hi Greg, we've emailed before, but I no longer work at that non-profit and have lost your email address.

I'm trying to enable sentence extraction on an old fork of FBReader that is used for reading text for blind and dyslexic students.  In this case I want to do it for students in India who speak Hindi. I think your current code does this in a different way.

I'd like to take the following line in the TtsSentenceExtractor,

```
    final Pattern p = Pattern.compile(""[\\.\\!\\?]\\s+"", Pattern.MULTILINE);
```

and change it to

```
    final Pattern p = Pattern.compile(""[\\.\\!\\?\\u0964]\\s*"", Pattern.MULTILINE);
```

I've added \u0964 (which is the Hindi sentence delimiter) and changed \s+ to \s\* since Hindi doesn't necessarily have a space following this delimiter. But my change isn't working and I was hoping you had some suggestions?

Thank you!
Rom

gregko/TtsPlus-FBReader,open,Possible issue with wakelocks after updating to Android 4.4,[],"Hello,
I am running Samsung Galaxy S II GTI9100 with omnirom 20140503 Android 4.2.2. Previously I was running CM-10 20121116 Android 4.1.
My issue is that when TTS plus is speaking it simply stops playing and I have to reboot the device in order to get the speech back.
Here is a logcat output http://pastie.org/9142471
Please can you look at this and possibly try helping me out if this might be related to your app?
