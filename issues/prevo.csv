I don't have that problem with any other app. I think the problem here is that the text starts at the very edge of the screen. Could you make the text start a few pixel further away from the edges?

Thank you for this App!"
bpeel/prevo,open,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.util.Log: int wtf(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)>:[8,25]
<android.util.Log: int wtf(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable)>:[8,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

NONE

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the project’s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report.

bpeel/prevo,closed,Material,[],"Here are some commits to give PReVo a more modern look. I would like to add a few more (e.g. white background) but I need to know if current patches might be merged before going too far.

Changes include:
- Gradle support (required for Android Studio)
- Increase minimum SDK to version 8 (Android 2.2)
- Use AppCompat library. It is possible that this change breaks build with Ant
- Removal of _About_ screen
- Replace zoom buttons by gesture
- Replace search button with Floating Actiion Button. Some people discourage the use of that kind of button, but it makes searching easier.
- More space
- Hide toolbar when scrolling
- New icon - the idea was to have something closer to material design guidelines but it's not very beautiful.
