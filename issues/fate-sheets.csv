ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Use a menu for character list items,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","On the character sheet list page there are two many options (edit, share, delete) and this list will only grow bigger. These action buttons should be moved to a menu hidden by a `...` menu. "
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Custom Aspects/Skills,"[Label(name=""question"")]","It would be nice to put a custom option for settings that go away from the default Aspects, like _Masters of Umdaar_ or _Loose Threads_. Also, it could be nice if you could put custom Skills, like used in _Wearing the Cape_"
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Translation,[],It could be good to put a way to translate the Character Sheets and text for other languages. I put myself available to translate for Brazilian Portuguese as by the official Fate publishing @ solarentrenimento.com.br
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Saving Issue - Primary Edit Text doesn't save,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""cannot replicate""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","User is seeing an issue where non-list item text fields are not updating on save. 

> it only saves secondary aspects (Not High Concept or Trouble). It also does not save character names or descriptions

This is particularly odd as they follow the same update logic, and have fewer intermediaries so I would expect these fields to be more reliable. "
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Saving Issue - Click twice to save,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""cannot replicate""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","Another report of an issue with saving. 

> Appears to require save button twice to track changes

I suspect this may be due to the text watchers firing after the save serialises the character object. 

*Solution*: Clear the focus before saving and add a second delay to the save button firing. 
"
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Preview View,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted""), Label(name=""question"")]","A user has requested a single page view that is read only. 

I think the export feature in #6 might be good enough to cover the use case for this. 

Will keep this ticket as a reference, to revisit after #6 completion"
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Add Sort to Skills List,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The skills list can get very big, which makes finding a particular skill in it difficult. 

Being about to sort the skills would make this a lot easier. 

Sort by:
* Alphabetic (description) ascending
* Numeric (value) descending

Have a toggle button in the Skills header that swaps between sort alpha and sort number icons. "
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Dice Roller Missing on FAE,"[Label(name=""bug"")]",The dice roller FAB is missing for FAE character sheets
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Saving is broken,"[Label(name=""bug"")]",Woops
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Section Titles wrapping,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","When viewing a character, the section titles wrap after 5 characters. This looks really ugly. 

This should either be fixed (dynamic title widths?) or the titles reduced to 5 characters each. "
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Why are pre-release buildtools required?,"[Label(name=""bug"")]",It's not a good practice to require pre-release buildtools like 26-rc1 to build own releases. I forcefully downgrade to 25.0.2 and it still seems to work. Any issues that I might have overlooked or what caused the upgrade?
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Release to production in Play Store,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Fate Sheets is now at a point where the features outnumber those available in the existing free (and upgrade paid) Fate character sheets application on the play store. 

Fate Sheets version needs to be updated to v1.0, play store details need to be updated and then released to the production channel. "
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Add Powered By Fate copyright information,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As this application utilises concepts from Fate RPG it would be appropriate to reference the original material in the credits/about page. 

Licensing information can be found here: 

http://www.faterpg.com/licensing/

At a minimum, the application should include the following text and I'd also like to include the Powered by Fate logo.

ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Dice Roller History,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Ability to view the history of rolled dice. 

While this application doesn't pretend to be a *trusted* source of truth during game play. It would be nice to have a history of rolls visible for those who use it as such.

ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Fix Adaptive-Icon Compat.,[],"Issue fix explanation: 

> Adaptive Icons were introduced in Android O API 26, though because the
file is in mipmap-anydpi, Android favors it over the other
resources. This causes issues on API 25 and below. By changing the
folder name from `mipmap-anydpi` to `mipmap-anydpi-v26` the icon will
only be selected on API 26 and above."
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Improve layouts and image resources to better match Material Design guidelines.,[],"This PR replaces old Android resources with Material resources, updates the icon to match Material Design guidelines, as well as using the new Android O Adaptive Icons, and a few small layout changes."

ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Group characters by game,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",When you have a lot of users it can become cumbersome to navigate through multiple characters and seeing which are related to each other in a game. If the characters are grouped by *game* this won't be a problem. 
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,User managed list of skills,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","It's common practice to modify the skill list for particular games. 

Fate Sheets should support this by allowing users to manage the list of skills. "
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Update Play Store Promo Images,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","The images suck. I want better ones. 

Make a folder in the repository root named `playstore` and populate as follows:

ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Initial release to Play Store and F-Droid,[],Need to do an initial release to both the play store and f-droid. Subsequent releases will not require a ticket. 
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Import character sheets,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","A way to import character sheets from external sources. 

Depends on #6 "

ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Fate docs and other helper information,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","A new activity accessible from the menu which has a list of links to associated Fate documentation. 

Documentation either https://fate-srd.com/ or http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/"
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,Dice Roller,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","There should be a dice roller in the application. 

Ideally the dice roller should have the following:

- [x] Display results of each die
- [ ] Show a record of `x` previous rolls
- [x] Display the Fate ladder result
- [x] Accessible from any screen on a character sheet
- [x] Ability to see any modifiers while using the dice roller (e.g. If I'm rolling for Stealth I should be able to see stealth skill)"
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,open,Game Creation Sheet,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",GMs also need to manage game creation. This is another sheets type which could be added to Fate Sheets. 
ScreamingHawk/fate-sheets,closed,FAE characters,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",The application currently only supports Fate Core characters. FAE is an equally popular game format and should be included for character management
