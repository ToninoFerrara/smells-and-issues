zaren678/Hdhomerun-signal-meter,closed,Fix for Android 5 when there is no internet connection,[],"First, thank you for this great tool! And you're extra awesome for putting it on Github :)

This is my first time working on an Android app so forgive me if I've done something wrong.
The situation I encountered was that when I had only my phone, a wifi AP, and the hdhomerun, Android 5 does not consider the Wifi connected without access to the internet and so I couldn't control the hdhomerun. This change should just check for an IP Address on the wifi interface and then proceed with discovering the hdhomerun devices.
