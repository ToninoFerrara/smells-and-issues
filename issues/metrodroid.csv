micolous/metrodroid,open,MdST compression,"[Label(name=""backlog""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","## Description of the issue

I'd reckon that not everyone would use every stop database, and some of them may never be loaded.

I would still like everything to be offline, so I still need to ship these things.

I think there is some value in compressing these.

I've been running experiments on `mdst-compression-experiment`, after adding a new compressed field to `mdst-license-notice`.  In `mdst-license-notice`, I moved the attribution data into a field which is gzip-compressed. 

Also in `mdst-license-notice`, I lazy-load the station index.

It's probably better to compress entire sections of the file. MdST requires you to load the header block, then the entire index block if you want to reference stations by ID.

Looking at a big database (`suica_rail.mdst`):

Mode | header size | stations size | index size
----|----|----|-----
_uncompressed_ | 18710 | 254315 | 56307
zlib (compressing each station record) | 9888 | 308086 | 24939
brotli (compressing each station record) | 8576 | 277950 | 15694
zlib (solid station records) | 9888 | 138167 | 24939
brotli (solid station records) | 8576 | 106444 | 15694

""compressing each station record"" is where I pushed a separate compressed block for each record in the file.  ""solid station records"" is where I concatenated all station records, then compressed the entire block.

It should be possible to make changes to the format to seek within a solid station record list. It does mean a bunch of data will need to be decompressed for every lookup, unless the solid blocks can be split.

At worst, just compressing the header and the index is generally a pretty good win."
micolous/metrodroid,open,Externalise/deduplicate card support matrix,"[Label(name=""backlog""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","## Description of the issue

There are currently multiple sources of card lists in Metrodroid:

- README.md: https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/blob/master/README.md
- The list on the website https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/blob/master/docs/index.md
- Google Play Store metadata in market.xml
- The modified version of market.xml used for F-Droid metadata
- `CardInfo`
- Detailed card info matrix: https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/wiki/checklists
- Individual wiki pages

I like the detailed card info matrix, because it has a lot of information about individual _available_ features, not just what we support.  There's also information which is off in individual wiki pages.

I like the wiki because it contains information as the support for a card gradually improves.

The website needs to be a little bit behind the rest, as that's what released on GPS / F-Droid.

I think the wiki is out of scope.  But at least getting a source of truth for everything that's _not_ the wiki would be an improvement.

Translation is still a challenge, but at least generating the source English text would help significantly.  Right now these get out of sync when I forget to action them.

## What information needs to be collated

- Card name
- (optional) Name of agency
- Agency's website
- Location (country, city)
- Card media type (MFC, MFD, MFU, ISO7816, FeliCa...)
- Logo

Maybe also get some screenshot metadata"
micolous/metrodroid,closed,Update ORCA stations,[],"This data came from a dump from @SoundTransit that provided the following:

|#|Location|
|-|-|
|4211091569|Angle Lake|
|150994945|Everett|
|150994946|Edmonds|
|150994947|King Street|
|150994948|Tukwila|
|150994949|Kent|
|150994950|Auburn|

|151002625|Mukilteo|
|151002626|Lakewood|
|151009253|South Tacoma|

Looking at King Street, if we convert `150994947` to hex, we get `9000003`.  I have no idea what the 9 means.  The existing data here shows `458755` for King Street, and converting that in hex is `70003`.  That one makes a little more sense, as `7` is the ID for Sound Transit, which is the agency responsible for the fare reader/writers at this station.
This methodology falls apart for the last three stations so I've omitted them for now."

I have an ""add my transit provider"" request. Unlike other requests, you've already done most of the work. I live in Los Angeles, which uses the Transit Access Pass card, also known as TAP. When used with Metrodroid, it is recognized as the Go Card (SEQ), with the correct serial number showing. The card balance and history tabs are sometimes accurate but usually show incorrect data. It would seem that the Go Card and TAP Card share record types, but have varying sectors for where the records go. Using your description of the record types, I was able to correctly extrapolate data from my card scans including tap, top-up, and balance records. The Metrodroid app is able to do this, but it only works on certain transactions.

I created a wiki page similar to your existing ones with information about the TAP card, including the data locations of the card. Unfortunately, a total noob at programming, so I can't offer much help with the actual coding. It seems that this card is pretty similar to the ones you have already added to this app. I am able to provide more data about the card if needed, including actions that the app currently does and does not read correctly. Would implementing this card be hard to accomplish? I

In order to calculate the fare, you need to know what zone a particular stop is in, and which fare table version to use for the agency.

This also probably means we need to handle continuations properly, which I'm unsure what state it is in.

The Translink GTFS data contains zone information (column: `zone_id`). We include this information at present with `compile_stops_from_gtfs.py`, as the `zone_id` column. This works for everything but the Airport stations which do not contain zone information.

micolous/metrodroid,closed,Remove GMS dependency,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Currently depends on GMS for Google Maps API v2.  The older versions of Farebot were available in F-Droid, but then depended on Google Maps API v1, which is deprecated.

It seems non-trivial to remove Google Maps API from the application at build time.

Instead, replace the mapping functionality with something like MapQuest Open tiles in a WebView with Leaflet.

Some basic understanding of the format is listed in this Python script: https://gist.github.com/micolous/5884e82a5ea7aff6c1df

This will need a database of stops built.  All cards are Mifare Classic 1K, all sectors locked, and require unique encryption keys for each card.
