rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,open,Suggestion: Alert Sound on the Server,[],Is it difficult to add an option to play a sound with the notification on the server? The Config file could have the options **Alert Sound: on/off** and **Alert sound path: /path/to/chosen/sound** 
rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,closed,Connection Timed Out when Pairing ,[],"Hi,
I've been using AN2Linux (using the Wifi option) for some time now, it always worked flawlessly. I noted 2 days ago I wasn't getting the notifications from my phone. After several attempts tinkering the configuration I choose to reinstall the app, delete the config file on my linux machine and start over.

The server part works, it starts and keeps waiting for connections. The problem seems to be that client cannot pair with the server, I always get the ""connection timed out warning"".

The only thing that I installed on my phone that could mess with AN2Linux is a firewall (AFWall+) but I'm sure I set it right so AN2Linux could run without any problem. I disabled the firewall to see if it was blocking anything but I got the connection timed out error anyway.

Any idea what could be blocking the pairing?

Thanks in advance,
Cheers "
rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,open,WIP: Add appname to notification data,[],"An attempt to add appName as mentioned [here](https://github.com/rootkiwi/an2linuxserver/pull/38).
It's not working 100% at the moment since I've probably messed up the data flow with my injection, hence the WIP. Probably an easy fix for @rootkiwi.

I was thinking to have appName sent at all times but given the way the data is sent it seems like this would break compatibilty with older versions of the server, so I guess it's better to be an option?"

rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,closed,Foreground notification service ,[],"This adds an option to run a service in the foreground to keep the app from being destroyed. After updating to Oreo the app missed a lot of notifications - before Oreo I didn't had any problems as the app was pretty responsive / wasn't destroyed.  The service fixes this problem as it keeps the app running.
Additionally I increased the target sdk to 28 as this allows the user to hide the notification dot from the system bar (manually).

I'm not an android developer so there might be some things that can be solved easier - feedback is welcome.
I tested this patch set on CarbonROM / Android 8.1.0 and can't vouch how other versions will behave."

rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,open,Suggestion: a little widget,[],"It would be great if there was a widget to enable and disable the application.
Something like a toggle button.

rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,open,Redesign proposal & small user experience issues,[],"Thanks for AN2Linux! It works great but I think the UI design could be improved.
![redesign](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8731884/25555176/83672c4e-2cdf-11e7-9a3a-93b6d9919551.png)

**Small UX issues**
* The port should default to `46352`.
* The SSID whitelist should let you pick from your networks.
* The SHA-256 hashes should be formatted in 4 columns (with 8 columns it's easier to loose your current column)
* The test notification shouldn't be displayed on the client and should give an error when the server isn't reachable."
rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,closed,SVG icons,[],"Hi, I restyled the icons for an2linux as svg's, you could use them...
- natively in Android since API level 21 (Android 5)
- for the server part on the desktop ( linux desktop env's support svg)
- to generate pngs easily in all kinds of sizes with inkscape: 
```
SIZES=""32 48 64 72 96 128 144 192 256 384 512"" 
for SIZE in $SIZES
do
inkscape --export-png=""${FILENAME}-${SIZE}x${SIZE}.png"" --export-width=${SIZE} --export-height=${SIZE} ${FILENAME}.svg
done
```

Please go to my gist: https://gist.github.com/conrad-heimbold/fa5193ca1587025d1500cafae99cbbd6 
(Github does not allow direct uploading of svg). 

If the icons should be changed, please tell me.

rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,open,Phone notifications with a changing status cause a new notification on the desktop every few seconds,[],"The offending notification is F-Droid's ""Updating Repositories"" info. It contains a short status line that says something like ""300mb out of 600mb done"". It is updated every second or so, and every time it is updated, a new notification shows up on my desktop, which is rather annoying.

It would be nice if an2linux could prevent this sort of spamming. If possible, it would be nice if the existing Desktop notification would be updated similarly to the Android notification. Otherwise it might be possible to limit the amount of notifications per app per time interval, or detect whether it's the same notification and don't send it again."
rootkiwi/an2linuxclient,closed,Future direction of app,[],"Hello,

I am wondering what the future direction of this app is, if any.

I was wondering if there are plans to allow more integration between Linux and your phone (such as checking battery level or setting your phone to silent), or if this project is intended to be for notifications only. "
