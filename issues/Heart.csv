I tried to open the ""Get it on Google Play"" link at https://daryldy.github.io/Heart/ but I get the following error
<img width=""1020"" alt=""screen shot 2017-10-30 at 17 50 52"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6558089/32183931-f6b8e2c2-bd9a-11e7-82ce-63dcf182b8b4.png"">

If I want to try this app, is it available on Google Play or do I have to compile it my self?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Best,
Francesc

daryldy/Heart,open,"remove extra ""save""",[],"Should not require an actual record save during a config change (i.e. screen rotate).
Active record should be separated from edit fragment so it can survive the config change and be redisplayed in the (new) edit fragment like the normal fields that android re-displays itself
- maybe a concept of a 'draft' record. The draft record is saved separately from regular records.
  - when would a draft record become a real record?
