I would really like you to implement a kind of whitelist in which any kind of app could be included, for example a music-playing app like Spotify. If you did so I added spotify in the whitelist so that when Spotify is opened and I lock the screen Spotify wouldn't stop playing because of BatteryFu disabling the data.
I hope to be clear, if I'm not please don't hesitate to ask for one or more clarification/s.
Have a nice day! "

"
tobykurien/BatteryFu,open,Feature request: Force sync behaviour,[],"Currently the combination of batteryFu with the app  podlisten its not that well. In my case podlisten should only sync every week and not if I turn on WiFi by using mode toggling. I can imagine only some solutions.
- A white or better black list of apps to sync (maybe for the  ""force sync"")
- Mode toggling without force sync command

As I might misunderstand the force sync option, that I don't want to turn off (good for putting mails and messages into the outgoing state). Could you explain it to me, if that's the case. (Would be helpful if I find the time to translate your app to German)
"
tobykurien/BatteryFu,open,"feature request: ""Custom connect times"" [hh:mm] and ""Connect time frequency"" without time-shift (e.g. before and after work sync and for peer-to-peer network users [""Antox"" and so on])",[],"BatteryFu works great for me.

BUT I miss one setting option since I played around with peer-to-peer instant messengers like _Antox_ https://github.com/subliun/Antox .
Unlike common non-peer-to-peer messengers messages are only sent when the sender AND the receiver are online.
If the sender and the receiver are using BatteryFu it could be that the ""Connect time intervals"" are not the same and the messages will never be sent.

Further it would be great to have an option to set special times directly for synchronising (for example before and after work.

Therefore my suggestion is to have two additional options to set ""**Custom connect times**""  and a fixed ""**Connect time frequency**"":

""**Custom connect times**"" could be a list of times with the time format **hh:mm** (like _""night mode""_)
(**advantage**: irregular intervals are possible [for example sync before work 7:15 am and sync after work 5:15pm] and it is easy to understand)
**AND**
""**Connect time frequency**"" as predefined intervals from which you could choose:
_""every full 15 minutes""_ 
_""every full 30 minutes_""
_""every full hour""_
(for frequencies longer than one-hour you need a fixed reference (for example ""midnight"") in order to get fixed defined times and the frequency must be a factor of 24hours.[if not you would have different you will have different connect times the next day])
_""every 2 hours relative to midnight""_
_""every 3 hours relative to midnight""_ 
_""every 4 hours relative to midnight""_ 
_""every 6 hours relative to midnight""_ 
_""every 12 hours relative to midnight""_ 

In the section ""_TIME SETTINGS_"" actually you have two options: ""_Sleep time_"" and ""_Connect time_"". Here you could add a third and fourth option called ""_Connect time frequency_"" and ""_Custom connect times hh:mm_""

| ""_TIME SETTINGS_"" |
| --- |
| _Connect time frequency (or interval)_ |
| _Custom connect times hh:mm_ |
| _Sleep time (frequency or interval)_ |
| _Connect time (duration)_ |

There will be no conflicts between the three options ""_Connect time frequency_"", ""_Custom connect times_"" and ""_Sleep time_"". If one of the first two options is active, the ""_Sleep time_"" is interrupted or delayed.
The ""_Connect time (duration)_"" will be the same for all three options above.

I hope my description was not too complicated. Sorry for my long issue/feature request and thanks for reading it.

tobykurien/BatteryFu,open,"App describes ""Data while screen on"" as ""not recommended"", but doesn't say why it's not recommended",[],"Hi!

I would like to be able to install apps and use my phone's web browser and whatnot.  To do this, I guess I must enable the ""Data while screen on"" setting.

When I enter the ""Settings > Data while screen on"" menu, the fine print for that setting says:  ""Enable data while the screen is switched on (not recommended)"".  But the fine print doesn't say why it's not recommended.  And even when I tap the setting, the app doesn't pop up any dialog box to tell me why it's not recommended.

I'm still clueless.  It would be most excellent if you could please modify the app to inform users of why that setting is not recommended.

P.S.  Thank you very much for writing, open-sourcing, and maintaining BatteryFu!

tobykurien/BatteryFu,closed,Fix data sometimes not disconnected on Android >= Kit Kat,[],"On Kit Kat and Lollipop, mobile data is sometimes not disconnected after connection. This seems to happen more often on Lollipop and is quite annoying. 
The reason seems to be the behaviour of the PreferenceManager when working with Shared Preferences with multiple processes. A workaround is the re-reading of the preferences file on each preference update / read (which is a bit costly, though).

The acutal data toggling logic was also moved to its own (short-living) service, eliminating the need for a Thread object. 

The code works fine on my CM12 (Lollipop) Android build and is currently being tested on a CM11 (Kit Kat) build.

Any hints?

tobykurien/BatteryFu,closed,Suggestion: Location Aware WiFi control,[],"Suggestion: Location Aware WiFi control

Hello,

I have a suggestion, could you possibly add a feature which checks if there is any recognised wireless connection and syncs but if there is no recognised wireless connections it does not. 

For example, if I am at Home or at Work it should sync automatically like normal however when I am travelling on the road it recognises that there is no known wireless and stops syncing. 

I think it may help save battery. There is an open source app which I think has this feature and you may be able to use it:
