theScrabi/OCBookmarks,closed,Update deps and added adaptive icon,[],"Hi @theScrabi,

i added adaptive icons to your app similar to [Notes](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes/commit/6368ef06c6598b384b901ebb4b6832ac7cad2b31), [News](https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android/pull/628), [OCReader](https://github.com/schaal/ocreader/pull/82), [Phone Sync](https://github.com/nerzhul/ownCloud-SMS-App/pull/188) and [(soon) Files](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/2444#issuecomment-379911794) android clients.

I hope, that all the Nextcloud apps in the ecosystem out there can have somewhen in the future a similar look and feel.

Here are some screenshots of what it would look like:

theScrabi/OCBookmarks,closed,[Feature request] Searching,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Searching is really needed, specially for people having hundreds or thousands of bookmarks. Should be able to search:

- Inside the URL

Thanks.

Expected behaviour:
Bookmarks are created independently and are not touched when the ""pure"" SLD bookmark is added in step 3.

Actual behaviour:
After step 3 the bookmarks of step 1 & 2 are changed to https://google.com

I could not recreate this in the web app. It only happens if you use the android app."

- The ability to sort tags alphabetically.

Here is the French translation, made with Stringlate.

Please read it, maybe it might have some problems with &#x2022; stuff, I don't know...

I decided to keep the English word Bookmark for this translation, what's your opinion about this?

EDIT : What about using crowdin or transifex?
Also, maybe you could made the Play Store description available for translations to reach more people on this platform?"
