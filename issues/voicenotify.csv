Voice Notify already helps, but the 'repeated message' mechanism looks at messages coming in, not messages that have been 'voiced', so this sort of 'empty message' behaviour fools Voice notify....

Voice Notify could deal with this very easily, if voice notify isn't going to 'say' the message (it's repeated, or its empty), then dont record it as the 'lastMsg' - so that Voice Notify really doesn't repeat itself :-)

Looks like a very simple fix around like 229 of Service.java ? Only record the lastMsg if the message hasn't been ignored?

I would like to use voice notification when I'm driving so I enable VN to work when screen is off and on and when headset is on (when the phone is connected to my car radio using bluetooth), but I noticed however that the voice notifications were blocked and in VN logs show that the headset was off.

I don't know if this behaviour is known but VN only reads a notification if the BT device is connected as media audio at the BT device properties. If I enable only phone audio VN thinks there is no headset, and unfortunately my car stereo only works as a phone audio BT device.

pilot51/voicenotify,open,"Add a ""Audio Stream"" to include BT Mono","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As an example, look at the playstore app BTMono.  This app is able to take all audio and ship it to BT Mono for playback on mono bluetooth headsets (often found in cars, (like mine)).
The problem with running BTMono is that its very simple, on all the time, or off.  If in a car it  interfers with regular audio since the car things its always in a phone call.  But if VoiceNotifier turn on BTmono functionality, only on a speech notification, and then turned it off, it would be the ideal situation.
