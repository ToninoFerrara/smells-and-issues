project-voodoo/ota-rootkeeper-app,open,Confused by non-suid /system/bin/su,[],"After a recent OTA update, I was left with a non-setuid /system/bin/su.  OTA Rootkeeper seemed to be confused by this, thinking the device was rooted, but unable to get root.  As a result, the only buttons available on the UI were temp un-root (which didn't work because /system/bin/su didn't grant root) and delete su backup (Noooooo!).

Thankfully I was able to use a terminal app to manually restore rootkeeper's su backup, but it would be much preferable if it handled this situation properly itself.
