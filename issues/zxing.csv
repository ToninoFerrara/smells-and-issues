zxing/zxing,closed, Improper Output Neutralization for Logs (CWE ID 117) (CRLF Injection),"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","**### Bug Reports**

We are using Zxing library (com.google.zxing:core: 3.3.3) on our project. And We did Vera Code (Ref: https://www.veracode.com ) Scan to find out the flaws and fix them. And We got the Improper Output Neutralization for Logs (CWE ID 117) (CRLF Injection) flaws on DecodeHintManager.java (Line Number: 227). It is producing by writing untrusted data into a log file allows an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into log files.

**Current Code, which produce this flaw**
Log.w(TAG, ""Ignoring hint "" + hintType + "" because it is not assignable from "" + hintData);

**Recommendations**
Avoid directly embedding user input in log files when possible. Sanitize untrusted data used to construct log entries by using a safe logging mechanism such as the OWASP ESAPI Logger, which will automatically remove unexpected carriage returns and line feeds and can be configured to use HTML entity encoding for non-alphanumeric data. Only write custom blacklisting code when absolutely necessary. Always validate untrusted input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.  (Taking reference from Vera Code Scan Report Recommendation). 

Can you guys please help to fix this issue ? I know, we can use the temporary Mitigation action (https://help.veracode.com/reader/DGHxSJy3Gn3gtuSIN2jkRQ/~p4MSKOS8F8X8h0KwFTKoQ) But I think, this is not good idea to avoid the issue instead of fix, if possible. Thanks!

## Proposal
`if (mode == Mode.BYTE && hasEncodingHint && !DEFAULT_BYTE_MODE_ENCODING.equals(encoding)) {`

The reason is that some old gun readers aren't prepared to read the ECI information and the read will fail if we add this ECI information (DATALOGIC QD2430 is a current example), some frameworks like jasper reports new versions are sending the Character encoding as hint ALWAYS, (i've warned them if so) but I hope it would be a stronger solution if you also check this.

I am using the library to scan QR Codes. It works fine except today it failed to read the attached aztec images. Could you please tell me why? Are the images too small? I uploaded these images to the zxing decoder page (online) and there the images got decoded just fine.

I am using Zxing to read QR Code from Vuforia Augmented Reality Camera. It works fine but the Vuforia camera seems lagging because Zxing process data everytime in the Camera's main thread. So, I just moved the decoding piece of code into a separate thread. 

Below is the code of my Script

```
public class qrcam : MonoBehaviour
{
    private bool cameraInitialized;
    private BarcodeReader barCodeReader;
    private Thread mythread;

    void Start()
    {
        barCodeReader = new BarcodeReader();
        StartCoroutine(InitializeCamera());
    }

    private IEnumerator InitializeCamera()
    {
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(1.25f);

        var isFrameFormatSet = CameraDevice.Instance.SetFrameFormat(Image.PIXEL_FORMAT.RGB888, true);
        cameraInitialized = true;
    }


   // Method to read the QR code 
    private void QrDecode()
    {
        if (cameraInitialized)
        {
            try
            {
                var cameraFeed = CameraDevice.Instance.GetCameraImage(Image.PIXEL_FORMAT.RGB888);
                if (cameraFeed == null)
                {
                    return;
                }

                new Thread(() =>
                {
                    Thread.CurrentThread.IsBackground = true;
                    var data = barCodeReader.Decode(cameraFeed.Pixels, cameraFeed.BufferWidth, cameraFeed.BufferHeight, RGBLuminanceSource.BitmapFormat.RGB24);
                    if (data != null)
                    {
                        // QRCode detected.
                        Debug.Log(data.Text);

                }).Start();

            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.LogError(e.Message);

    }
}
```

Now the camera is lagging slightly.  However, if I change the Image.PIXEL_FORMAT.RGB888 to GrayScale, the camera isn't lagging. But I wasn't able to fetch the data from QR code if Pixel format is GrayScale.

So, can you please assist me with the code to read the QR code using GrayScale format."

I am working with and relatively new to PDF417 images and am trying to decode them. I am utilizing the com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.decode() method [(link) ](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/blob/04595508b63c3bde614b59dac361b50bfadb8757/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/pdf417/decoder/PDF417ScanningDecoder.java) and I see that the last 2 required parameters are: ""int minCodewordWidth"" and ""int maxCodewordWidth"".
Aside from the fact that I do not know how to obtain those, there is also a todo note up top that reads, ""TODO don't pass in minCodewordWidth and maxCodewordWidth, pass in barcode columns for start and stop pattern columns"".

At the time of this call, I have the bitmap image of the actual pdf417, the base64 String version of it, the BinaryBitmap, the ResultPoint array, and the PDF417DetectorResult(s). 

My question is, with the information I have, **how do I determine the required variables that are needed for this function**?

First, thanks for this great library.  I'm just using the Reed Solomon part of it and I stumbled on I think a corner-case bug. 

When using data+error_codes of size 256, if I corrupt the **first** byte (after ReedSolomon encoding), neither the byte is ""repaired"" nor an exception is thrown when decoding.  It doesn't seem to matter how many error_codes I use or the data content, but it only fails for data+error_codes of size 256.

I grep'd the ReedSolomon code for literals 255 and 256 but saw nothing fishy.

zxing/zxing,closed,Android: stored QR Code can´t be read but scanned - MultiFormatReader.decode(bitmap) returns null,[],"**Description of the problem:**

Some qr-codes can´t be decoded via MultiFormatReader or QRCodeReader with the method decode(bitmap). But the same qr-codes are scannable via IntentIntegrator(). The reader.decode(bitmap) method returns a null Result. This happens on both Android and Java application, scannable but not decodable. I tried to exclude some chars, but that´s not the problem. Wether chars, nor the length ist the problem. It seems it is the combination. Used the same chars in another order in hundreds of tries and it worked, only a few barcodes have the problem.

zxing/zxing,closed,Can't generate Aztec code when set EncodeHintType.ERROR_CORRECTION,[],"Hi,
I try to generate Aztec code and use EncodeHintType.ERROR_CORRECTION but it throws NumberFormatException.

I found that in the source code of AztecWriter try to parse the error correction value to an integer.
`if (hints.containsKey(EncodeHintType.ERROR_CORRECTION)) {
        eccPercent = Integer.parseInt(hints.get(EncodeHintType.ERROR_CORRECTION).toString());
 }`
The value is string ""L"", ""M"", ""Q"", ""H"" and can't parse to integer. So it stop there.
I guess PDF417Writer face this issue too."
zxing/zxing,closed,Make integration of the core to 3rd party Android apps simpler ,[],"Zxing has an Android app implemented in `android` submodule. It contains classes that might be used by other developers who want to implement a QR/bar code scanner in their apps. The simplest way to do it now is to copy sources of this sumbodule and modify them if needed. This is not very good as:

1. The submodule is quite big and contains a lot of sources (e.g. `PreferencesActivity`) that are unlikely to be needed in other apps

2. The submodule contains some code that is better to be shared as it is quite generic (e.g. `ViewfinderView`, `DecodeHintManager`, CameraConfigurationManager`) and might be updated in the future to workaround device specific bugs

To avoid this developers should be able to import only generic Android classes in their projects.

This pull request divides `android` classes into two groups: zxing-specific classes and generic classes. The latter are moved into `android-core` submodule and can be used by other developers via a simple dependency import."

Thanks for your great work!
I have tested ZXing on my Nexus 4 and found it suffers from a low frame rate issue. The camera is very slow and appears choppy on Nexus 4. Although it does not affect the major functionality but it still affects the usability.
I also found the following Stack Overflow discussions and adopted the workaround in this pull request.

zxing/zxing,closed,Using 'zxing' prefix for all generated artifacts,[],"The idea is to have a standard prefix for all _zxing_ artifacts so they don't conflict with existing ones (IMO) `core`, `javase`, `android` are too generic and might ""collide"" with others. Furthermore, the prefix makes it perfectly clear at a glance what is the function of the deployed JAR/WAR/artifact.

I am aware that this breaks backward compatibility in the sense that _Maven_ POM(s) using them will need to be updated, but in the long run I believe this is the correct way to go - see [Spring](https://spring.io/projects), [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) and others that use this convention.

P.S. I also removed the `<version>` where artifact version is same as the parent as it is the default _Maven_ behavior and also makes the POM(s) more robust since we avoid version duplication (a.k.a. the [D.R.Y. principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)). Note that I have left the special version override `4.7.7` in the _android_ POM."

Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] when not building a core library.
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] going on.
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] It is also often of questionable legality.
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] the ""--core-library"" option to suppress this error message.
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] If you go ahead and use ""--core-library"" but are in fact

Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating

Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a

Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into

Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help
Error:Android Pre Dex: [android.jar] you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then

zxing/zxing,closed,ZXing creates wrong barcode (for text with leading asterisk?),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi,

this is a follow-up of issue  #806. Now we are using version 3.3.1 and it solves all issue reported in #806.

In our project we create data matrix barcodes using ZXing (core-3.3.1.jar and javase-3.3.1.jar) in this way:
```java
        final DataMatrixWriter barcode = new DataMatrixWriter();
        final BitMatrix bitMatrix = barcode.encode(text, BarcodeFormat.DATA_MATRIX, 0, 0);
```
We create an image (java.awt.Image) using the bit matrix and scan this barcode image afterwards (form screen or paper). In 99% percent of all cases the text of the scanned barcode image is identical to the the encoded text.

But in some cases we get another text. Examples:

* original text -> converted to barcode
* `*CH/GN1/022/00` -> `*CH/GN1/022/{00`

I suppose the leading asterisk causes again the problem.

zxing/zxing,closed,Raised Digits lead to wrongly detected EAN-13,[],"Scanning EAN-13 codes formatted in a certain way leads to wrongly detected EANs. It happens when the leading (human readable) digit is raised to the level of the bars and the bars have a relatively low height.

I assume that due to the low height of the overall code, some bounding box detection decides, that the raised digit may be part of the actual code, since removing the leading (human readable) digit results in a correct detection.

The behaviour can be easily reproduced with the described EAN-13 code layout. I attached a minimalistic code sample as well as two images which lead to an erroneous detection. However, trying to detect such kind of codes with different Applications that claim to use zxing leads to similar results.

zxing/zxing,closed,Suggestion to backport an improved datamatrix detector,[],"I needed a c++ library for datamatrix detection+decoding and found [this new c++ port](https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp) of the ZXing library. [Like](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22381421/zxing-library-cant-decode-datamatrix-barcode) [other](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12721077/issue-to-read-multiple-barcodes-using-zxing-library) [people](https://github.com/glassechidna/zxing-cpp/issues/33#issuecomment-338646683), too, I quickly found out that the datamatrix detector is quite limited in capabilities.

The single biggest issue turned out to be the dependence on the `WhiteRectDetector` to look for a white bounding box parallel to the image borders that contains the datamatrix code and nothing else. So with many real world situations where you have some text near the code and the code is not perfectly aligned with the image border, like [here](http://www.neuhausag.ch/assets/uploads/images/produkte/Etiketten/Produkte_Etiketten_Barcodeetiketten_2DCode.jpg), [here](https://www.deutsche-apotheker-zeitung.de/_Resources/Persistent/55c53726b5bbcc918ec7800229cf2e9d27794c21/k4_931_258080_258181-800x343-660x283-482x271.jpg) or [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tvxeo.jpg), you have no chance. It also may lead to [this](https://github.com/glassechidna/zxing-cpp/issues/42) peculiar problem.

This led me to implement the detector from scratch with the main focus on two things:
 1. try to detect the code with as little quite zone as possible (1 module) and
 1. do that in an image with as low a resolution as possible.

What I came up with can be found [here](https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp/blob/2ceda95cba943b3b2ab30af3c90150c97e84d416/core/src/datamatrix/DMDetector.cpp#L442-L1072). It is currently capable of detecting all the samples from the blackbox tests and a lot more challenging ones, like the mentioned examples above.

This would require a couple hours worth of JAVA coding, so it is probably not going to happen. But maybe it would make sens to keep this issue open so someone who also needs a better datamatrix detector and is willing to spend that effort might find the info I assembled here."

Therefore I am creating an identical strings.xml file in a values-nb folder.

After further investigation it seems the vertical and horizontal pattern is accepted at the above incorrect center, for this particular QR Code.
Which lead me to come across these concerns:

It seems at [FinderPatternFinder.java:78](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/qrcode/detector/FinderPatternFinder.java#L78)
`pureBarcode = hints != null && hints.containsKey(DecodeHintType.PURE_BARCODE);`
the default for `pureBarcode` is false (I'd rather assume most QR Codes are pure monochrome?)
eg. `pureBarcode = hints == null || hints.containsKey(DecodeHintType.PURE_BARCODE);`

In any case at [FinderPatternFinder.java:496](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/qrcode/detector/FinderPatternFinder.java#L496) it seems that the diagonal check is ignored when it is not monochrome (`!pureBarcode || crossCheckDiagonal(...`). This seems strange can someone please explain the reasoning behind this, I don't understand it. According to me it should still do the check regardless if it is a `pureBarcode` or not.

I'll submit a pull request if required.

**meaning of Pure Barcode:**
```
  /**
   * Image is a pure monochrome image of a barcode. Doesn't matter what it maps to;
   * use {@link Boolean#TRUE}.

zxing包不支持扫描多种颜色混合的二维码，如果是多种颜色混合的二维码，可能会有部分色块丢失，导致无法识别。查看源码发现，在解码过程中，二维码图片会被解析成黑白图片做解析，彩色的部分有可能会在转黑白时丢失，导致解码失败。经过尝试微信、qq、百度都可以正常解析彩色二维码，还请大牛协助解决。感激不尽。"
zxing/zxing,closed,"Camera won't focus, is distorted, and can't scan",[],"Yes, I tried all of the device bug workarounds.

The device is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, knows as either p5110 or espressowifi.

Recently installed LineageOS 13.0 on it.

Camera app works fine. Displays everything perfectly. Text and codes are completely readable.

When I start zxing, what the screen shows is terribly distorted (holding the device in landscape mode, a square appears about three times as wide as it does tall, where it appears as a square in the camera app), text and codes are not readable (fuzzy), and very few scans (less than ten percent) are ever successful.

Followed the logging instructions, and this is what I came up with:

I love ZXing and have used it for a few projects now. My most recent problem is a bit trickier. I want to make a web browser that links to http://zxing.appspot.com/scan to retrieve barcode data.

The first one always works, the second one never does, you are greeted with 'you need to install free Barcode Scanner -app' even though I obviously have it as I used it seconds ago.

File sources are as follows:

Please for any suggestions for this solution.

There is also information on https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Scanning-From-Web-Pages that:
""Note that this functionality will be available on the iPhone app Barcodes. iOS works differently, and so the URL pattern must instead use the zxing://scan/ URL""

zxing/zxing,closed,ZXing creates wrong barcode (for text with leading asterisk?),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi,

in our project we create data matrix barcodes using ZXing (core-3.3.0.jar and javase-3.3.0.jar) in this way:
```java
        final DataMatrixWriter barcode = new DataMatrixWriter();
        final BitMatrix bitMatrix = barcode.encode(text, BarcodeFormat.DATA_MATRIX, 0, 0);
```
We create an image (```java.awt.Image```) using the bit matrix and scan this barcode image afterwards (form screen or paper). In 99% percent of all cases the text of the scanned barcode image is identical to the the encoded text.

But in some cases we get another text. Examples:
* original text -> converted to barcode
* `*MEMANT-1F-MESTECH` -> `*MEMANQ90E5079ROO70` 
* `*MEMANT-1F-M-2estech` -> `*MEMANQ90E5089q{estech`

* `*MEMANT-1F-M6ABCDEF` -> `*MEMANQ90E5091`

您好，我是一名来自中国的安卓开发者，正在使用3.3.0版本的库，开发中遭遇一个问题：
我在识别CODE_128格式的条码，内容是99770280035299，在取景框稍微向左或向右偏移大约20度时，会识别为如UPC_E、EAN_8格式，内容如[UPC_E]01723047、[UPC_E]12668515、[EAN_8]18788082，测试手机为三星GalaxyGrand2、xiaomi4S、OPPOA59M、华为畅享5S。

zxing/zxing,closed,Improve Datamatrix Scan Performance,[],"Thanks for maintaining zxing, it's probably the best open source library for barcodes out there.

Currently, I am trying to scan datamatrix codes, however, scan performance is not very good (see attachment), especially with larger (6x6) datamatrix codes. Scanning from my screen while the codes are enlarged is doable, but It's nearly impossible to scan the attached codes from printed pages.

I am aware that this project is in maintenance mode and this is more or less a feature request. However, if you could point me in the direction of some other library (or just the necessary optimizations) which offer/s better datamatrix scan performance, I would be happy integrate the code into zxing and file a pull request.

Attached file:
[Testfälle_bmp023.pdf](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/files/799996/Testfalle_bmp023.pdf)

Further information and background:
Germany has decided to standardize medication plans (see examples in attachment pdf). They chose to use datamatrix instead of qr codes (hm). The first smartphone apps in the app stores seem to be licensing proprietary scan technology.

So at the moment our options are:
- Everyone licenses proprietary scanners
- Change the standard from datamatrix to qr codes (better scanning performance)

If we don't find an open-source library which delivers satisfactory datamatrix scanning performance, we're in for a fun ride..

Any answer is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

zxing/zxing,closed,Problem using  zxing 3.3.0 with ant's artifact:dependencies,[],"I changed a pom.xml entry to zxing to 3.3.0 
```

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.google.zxing</groupId>
			<artifactId>core</artifactId>
			<version>3.3.0</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.google.zxing</groupId>

		  <artifactId>zxing-parent</artifactId>
		  <version>3.3.0</version>
		  <type>pom</type>
		</dependency>
```

and now I'm getting this:

```
    [artifact:dependencies] Unable to resolve artifact: Unable to get dependency information: Unable to read the metadata file for artifact 'com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio-core:jar': Invalid JDK version in profile 'java8-and-higher': Unbounded range: [1.8, for project com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio-core
    [artifact:dependencies]   com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio-core:jar:1.3.1

```

From what I can find this indicates that something is wrong with the pom file for zxing related to the required versions of java (which I'm using java 8)?

The code compiles fine using Maven and Eclipse, but this error occurs when attempting to run a separate ant process.

	<artifact:dependencies filesetId=""dependency.fileset"">
		<artifact:pom file=""${basedir}/pom.xml""/>
	</artifact:dependencies>

The ant task works just fine if I use zxing 2.2 in the pom but then of course my code does not.
Is this a bug in zwing 3.3.0 or am I missing something?"
zxing/zxing,closed,Android vCard parse: type default / type order,"[Label(name=""android""), Label(name=""bug"")]","Barcode scanner seems to be using different type defaults for `ADR` and `TEL` than suggested in the specification (at least for vCard 2.1). For me it defaults to 'private' but it should to 'work'. From looking at the code it seems that there is no default internally. This can also result in wrong order of types, e.g. this vCard data will swap the types of the second and third number.  

```
BEGIN:VCARD
N:;John;;;
TEL;WORK:10
TEL:2
TEL;CELL:30
END:VCARD  
```

IMHO a good solution for both issues would be to default to the type 'WORK' for phone numbers and addresses at parse time. This should be close enough to the specification. Maybe also for eMails.  

I guess this could be implemented by adding a `defaultType` Parameter to the function `matchVCardPrefixedField` in VCardResultParser.java?

zxing/zxing,closed,Could not decode image,[],"Hi!

I already tried the option harder or uses the online decoder.
But this image (it is from a telefax) could not decoded - but another app could find the qrcode.

Is there a change to get this with zxing?

Best wishes

rarely, but sometimes I catch com.google.zxing.NotFoundException. 

At the same time I am trying to scan this QRCode with my android device and it works fine.

zxing/zxing,closed,Core: Aztec decoding fails for large symbols unless pixel-perfect,[],"Scanning any Aztec code larger than approximately 67x67 with a mobile phone running BarcodeScanner-4.7.5.apk is very difficult in my experience, becoming entirely infeasible at 91x91 (or more); when NeoReader on the same mobile phone (Galaxy S6) scans these with great ease, 

The problem lies in ZXing core. It is repeatable on test images of excellent visual quality. At size 91x91, ZXing (e.g. as of [here](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx)) fails to detect Aztec codes in images that are even so slightly imperfect.

zxing/zxing,closed,"Core: DecoderResult's rawBytes comes without bit length indication, ambiguity arises",[],"The [DecoderResult class](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/common/DecoderResult.java#L28) has a getRawBytes() method returning a byte array with the raw code's content. Problem is, there's no way to know exactly how many bits are in there: up to 7 bits in the last byte can be unused (in which case they are zeroes, and indistinguishable from actual bits at zero). This can be a cause of ambiguity, to the point that codes with different contents can have the same RawBytes, defeating its use as an inspection tool.

For examples, these two Aztec codes both have RawBytes<br>`f5 55 55 75 6b 5a d6 b5 ad 6b 5a d6 b5 ad 6b 5a d6 b5 ad 6b 5a d6 b0`<br>but the left one one contains<br>`88888TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT`<br>while the right one contains<br>`88888TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTO`<br>

Both are plain vanilla Aztec codes generated with [bwip-js](http://bwip-js.metafloor.com/demo/demo.html) using `format=full eclevel=31` and their respective content. At the end of the rawBytes, the `b0` byte actually contains the bits `1001` in the left code and `10010000` in the right code, and that changes the decoded content.

The issue is one of design of the DecoderResult class. I see two ways to fix this:
1. Extend the DecoderResult class (in package com.google.zxing.common) with a getRawBytesBitSize() method returning an int telling how many bits there are in what getRawBytes() returns. This will leave any existing code working (including zxing's own test code), and requires no change in existing decoders when they never leave unused bits in RawBytes, or when that somewhat does not matter.
2. Fill any unused bits of the last byte in RawBytes with bits at one rather than zero in package com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder. That makes it possible to unambiguously decode RawBytes into content of the Aztec code for any standard-conforming Aztec code, because extra one bits can only produce content if the length of an earlier byte shift sequence was followed by less than 8 times that number of bits (something ISO/IEC 24778:2008 does not condone).

Method 1 is certain to cause no compatibility issue, but makes the full interface of the DecoderResult class more complex,

Method 2 might not be extensible to all symbologies (if any other turns out to be affected by the limitation of the design of the DecoderResult class), often modifies the last byte in RawBytes returned for a given Aztec code (which in turn will require simple changes to zxing's test code specific to the Aztec decoder), and could conceivably silently break some existing application code. On the other hand this method
- is likely to fix existing application code decoding RawBytes according to ISO/IEC 24778:2008;
- ensures that when rebuilding a code from its RawBytes alone, even when the image is different (which can still happen), the content is the same (with aforementioned exceptions involving non-conforming original; also, attempted rebuilding could still fail if the few extra bits cause the maximum capacity to become exceeded);
- makes the existing [ZXing Decoder Online](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) and similar tools more useful as a debugging aid if left without modification to show what the hypothetical new getRawBytesBitSize() gives;
- causes the less code bloat.

Any thoughts on what's the way to go?

The discrepancy boils down to diverging interpretation of :

> Byte Shift (B/S) is a special case, shifting into a run length-controlled string of literal 8-bit bytes. Following a B/S is a 5-bit binary value: if non-zero, it encodes the number of bytes (1 to 31) that follow, but if zero then the next 11 bits encode the number of bytes less 31. Byte Shift can thus encode either isolated extended ASCII or control characters or long strings of byte data, possibly filling the whole symbol. At the end of the byte string, **encoding returns to the _mode_ from which B/S was invoked**.

The closest thing to a definition of _mode_ would be

> The Upper and Lower code sets contain upper and lowercase alphabetic characters respectively; Mixed contains a mixture of ASCII control and punctuation characters; Punctuation contains common punctuation characters and combinations; and Digit contains the numerals plus some punctuation (..)<br>Message encoding starts in the Upper code set, and can be latched (semi-permanently, via U/L, L/L, M/L, P/L, or D/L) or shifted (for one character only, via U/S or P/S) into the other _modes_ as needed.

In a literal interpretation, _mode_ means one of Upper, Lower, Mixed, Punctuation, and Digit; we are in Upper mode after U/S (even though that's only until the next character); thus ""the _mode_ from which B/S was invoked"" is Upper; thus we return to the Upper mode at the end of the Byte Shift sequence; and further, since there has been at least one character ( h ) in the Byte Shift sequence, the temporary Upper Shift has ceased to be in effect when the decoder _returns to the mode from which B/S was invoked_.

The interpretation made by ZXing could to be that _the next character_ after U/S is B/S, and that ends the Upper sequence and brings back to Digit, and that's the mode in which B/S is invoked; however that is paradoxical since B/S does not appear in the codes of Digit mode; and requires to treat B/S as a character, while the _character set_ is defined as ""all 8-bit values"" plus ""two non-data characters"" (FNC1 and ECI), which does not include B/S. The only thing weakly in support of ZXing's interpretation is that annex H, table LatLen, counts 14 bits to go from Digit to Binary _and back_ including 5-bit length (when that would require 19 bits per the above literal interpretation). However annex H similarly miscounts how many bits it takes to go from Punctuation to Binary and back (as 15 bits rather than the unambiguous 20 bits); is a general mess; and is informative only, thus can not override normative parts of the standard.

The problem is fixed (with no negative side effect, I hope) by inserting

```
          latchTable = shiftTable;  // after U/S B/S, return to Upper mode
```

between the two lines 133/134 of [core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/aztec/decoder/Decoder.java](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/aztec/decoder/Decoder.java#L133) currently reading

```
          // Table changes
          if (str.charAt(6) == 'L') {
```

Of course a test case should be added in [core/src/test/resources/blackbox/aztec-1](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/tree/master/core/src/test/resources/blackbox/aztec-1), with dlusbs.png and the expected dlusbs.txt, as enclosed in this zip: 
[dlusbs.zip](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/files/394203/dlusbs.zip)

The problem was detected by encoding test input 3333h3i3j33333 with a tentative direct implementation of the encoding algorithm in annex H, written on the assumption that it is optimal (it's stated goal) at least in the case of letters and digits. Decoding worked fine with ZXing, not with NeoReader. The root cause of the issue seems to be the messy annex H and ZXing's implementation of the decoder.

zxing/zxing,closed,plain pbm image format not working if whitespace in raster is omitted,[],"[foobar.zip](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/files/380393/foobar.zip)
Hello,

I don't know whether the following issue is due to your website image reader or due to your zxing library.
There is no impressum and no contact on your [website](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) so I put the issue here.

When uploading a **plain PBM** image and there's no whitespace in the pbm's raster section, the website will prompt:

> **No Barcode Found**
> No barcode was found in this image. Either it did not contain a barcode, or did not contain one in a supported format, or the software was simply unable to find it. Go ""Back"" in your browser and try another image.

The [plain PBM specification](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pbm.html) states:
- Each pixel in the raster is represented by a byte containing ASCII '1' or '0', representing black and white respectively.
- White space in the raster section is ignored.

In example gimp omits the spaces between the entries when an image is exported as pbm(ascii).
In the zip archive only file foobar2.pbm (with spaces inbetween) works and produces ""foobar"".

zxing/zxing,closed,How to port Java ME build,[],"Hi.
I would like to know if it is possible to port Zxing for Java ME platform and also, how I can do that. I know that many people strongly believe that Feature phones are no more in demand but in a recent finding I made, Feature phone are surprisingly still dominating the mobile market and they are still being manufactured by mobile phone giants like Tecno, Gionee, and even Nokia.

In that note, it will be nice to have Zxing work on this platform as well. If porting Zxing can not be an option, can you then please provide me with the old Java ME/J2ME build so that I can work with?

Thank in advance.

I noticed the preview image looked a bit weird, and found out, that it looks like the red and blue colors are swapped, it looks something like an RGB vs BGR issue (are you using OpenCV underneath maybe?). The strange thing is that it looks OK for a moment when starting or exiting from the app.

Scanning QR codes still work fine (as they don't need to be in a specific color), so otherwise I think it causes no major problems.

It reads no problem, but our partner's system does not accept it, claiming that in the raw barcode data, right after `JCB`, there is a service character code 254 (`FE`) that ends the C40 encoding mode, and C40 mode is only reentered after `LL13`, whereas their system has a strict requirement for the C40 mode to be used throughout the entire barcode. The 24x24 size is also a strict requirement of theirs.

Indeed, raw barcode data, as reported by the ZXing online decoder, seems to match what they are saying:

```
e6 92 f0 fe 21 83 96 82   82 8e 82 82 82 ac 4d 4d
8f e6 56 8f 29 1d 13 3c   13 3c 13 3c 13 3c fe 21
81 88 1f b5 
```

`e6` at offset 0 starts C40, then there is `fe` at offset 3, then there is another `e6` at offset 17.

We believe this is not expected behaviour, or is it?

```
    Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),R.drawable.qrcode);
    String result = DecodeUtils.decodeWithZxing(bitmap);
```

`R.drawable.qrcode`   is a `.jpg` file.

And `BarCodeUtil.java` is:

```
 public static String decodeWithZxing(Bitmap bitmap) {
    MultiFormatReader multiFormatReader = new MultiFormatReader();
    Map<DecodeHintType, Object> hints = new Hashtable<>();
    hints.put(DecodeHintType.PURE_BARCODE, Boolean.TRUE);
    multiFormatReader.setHints(hints);

    int width = bitmap.getWidth();
    int height = bitmap.getHeight();

    int[] pixels = new int[width * height];
    bitmap.getPixels(pixels, 0, width, 0, 0, width, height);

    Result rawResult = null;
    RGBLuminanceSource source = new RGBLuminanceSource(width, height, pixels);

    if (source != null) {
        BinaryBitmap binaryBitmap = new BinaryBitmap(new HybridBinarizer(source));
        try {
            rawResult = multiFormatReader.decodeWithState(binaryBitmap);

            multiFormatReader.reset();
        }
    }
    return rawResult != null ? rawResult.getText() : null;

```

But when I run the above code,I got a exception: 

> com.google.zxing.NotFoundException

So I search the exception,someone think bitmap size causes this exception.Then I resize the bitmap size:

```
    BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
    options.inSampleSize = 4; 
    Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),R.drawable.zhifubao,options);
    String result = DecodeUtils.decodeWithZxing(bitmap)
```

But it still does not work for me.

Is there a good solution to decode bitmap with a qrcode?

zxing/zxing,closed,Improve efficiency of DataMatrix detector,[],"This pull request improves efficiency of DataMatrix detector in TRY_HARDER mode. Using existing image sets the DataMatrixBlackBox2TestCase decodes 6 more images in 0 degrees rotation, 1 more in 180 degrees rotation and 1 more in 270 degrees rotation.

The main motivation for the proposed changes was the poor decode results of DataMatrix reader having as input scanned images that contain DataMatrix barcodes. We had large sets of scanned images that have little distortion caused by the scanner or pencil lines by humans on the barcode. In this version we can read images like the following:

![cropimage1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3668016/16297307/cc3086dc-391f-11e6-8c81-590fb0223357.jpg)

The main enhancements in detector algorithm are the following:
1.We don’t need to correct TopRight edge point, the edges are computed correctly from the beginning thus the initial computation of dimension does not need correction.
2.In order to compute transitions we sample more segments, moving edge points in proper direction. The final result is the most popular transition among samples.
3.To compute edge points in a rectangle we enhance the existing algorithm that uses getBlackPointOnSegment() with two more segments. The one moves on horizontal axis at double speed, and the other moves on vertical axis at double speed. Finally, we combine the results to compute the edge point.
4.We introduce tolerance in WhiteRectangleDetector. The result is that the algorithm is more efficient in low quality images with distortion. 
5.We enhance the calculation of transitions of a segment with a validation algorithm that compares each transition length to the length of the most popular transition. If a length is too small (probably sign of distortion of human interpolation) we investigate the problematic area and if find proofs of distortion we correct the calculation of transition.
Finally, there are no changes in algorithm in normal mode (that does not uses TRY_HARDER hint).

The issue is that `localLuminance` in [GlobalHistogramBinarizer](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/blob/b189fd1d5629770b1ecbdf3e2f55a37776538957/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/common/GlobalHistogramBinarizer.java#L71) directly accesses the 2nd element (which does not exist).

zxing/zxing,closed,Use StringWriter to prevent race condition in println,[],"@srowen This pull request resolves a race condition seen in printing output in the command line runner. I'm not entirely sure why this occurs, but presumably the multithreaded execution of the command line runner can cause the `println` calls to be executed out of order. This is apparently something that [can happen with println in multithreaded execution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19460987/why-is-system-out-prinln-out-of-order).

I found this occurs in two cases in my OS X environment. The first was when one of the input files is a symlink to another of input files. The second was when the files had very recently been written to disk by another program. I'm guessing in both cases, the data is already in memory, making the race condition more likely. The goofy output looks like this:

```
file:///Users/lucaswiman/opensource/zxing/javase/text1.png (format: QR_CODE, type: TEXT):
Raw result:
text1
Parsed result:
text1
Found 3 result points.
  Point 0: (44.0,156.0)

  Point 1: (44.0,44.0)
  Point 2: (156.0,44.0)

Decoded 2 files out of 2 successfully (100%)
```

Note that the points from the first file were printed while printing the points from the second file.

In order to avoid the race condition, I wrote the output using a `StringWriter` for each file, printing the output for each file when it's ready. My understanding is that `System.out.println` synchronizes the output buffer, so this should be a safe operation. 
## Testing

I tested this out with the following two runs below. The example files were this QR code, and a symlink to it:

zxing/zxing,closed,"[UWP] Error: ""The stream number provided was invalid."" while screen rotation",[],"While checking out the UWP example app on my Windows 10 Mobile device got reproducable crashes when I rotate the screen while the scanner is active.

> ""The stream number provided was invalid.\r\nPreviewState""

I tried to narrow down the problem and figured that the following code was causing the problem in ZXingScannerControl:

```
async void displayInformation_OrientationChanged(DisplayInformation sender, object args)
{
        displayOrientation = sender.CurrentOrientation;
        await SetPreviewRotationAsync();
 }
```

Commenting out this OrientationChanged event handler fixed the issue. Sure, the downside of this was that after rotating the phone, the camera behaved weired, due to the skipped call of SetPreviewRotationAsync().

**My suggestion for quick-fixing the issue:**
When navigating to the ScanPage, lock the screen orientation to the current rotation:

```
// LOCK screen rotation
var currentOrientation = Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation.GetForCurrentView().CurrentOrientation;
Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation.AutoRotationPreferences = currentOrientation;
```

Afterwards, unlock it:

```
// UNLOCK screen rotation
Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation.AutoRotationPreferences = Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayOrientations.None;
```

In my opinion, not being able to rotate the screen while scanning is much better than having a crash :)

zxing/zxing,closed,PDF417 Decoder converting output to Unicode,[],"( I should note I am writing a PDF417 encoder -- using ZXing as part of my unit tests to verify my encoder )

I have encoded the following hex-string using mode 924 byte compaction `e7650b61cd02` -- which corresponds to the bytes `231 101 11 97 205`, or the codewords `924 387 700 208 213 302` after byte compaction. 

Zxing decodes ( through my script: https://gist.github.com/anall/ac92df67abc95419545d ) to the hex-encoded string `c3a7650b61c38d02`

This seems to coorespond to the following utf8-encoded ""words"": `c3a7 65 0b 61 c38d 02`

`c3a7` is `e7`, and `c38d` is `cd`

I should note I have tried a barcode created both with my encoder, and `zint` and get identical results.

A modification (which you can see hints of commented out in my script) I made to allow the decoded codewords to be exposed to my test script shows that both encoders contain the same codewords, ignoring padding and error correction.

the zint-created barcode has been attached.

zxing/zxing,closed,False positive EAN_8 barcode extracted in addition to correct UPC-A and QR-CODE barcodes,[],"I noticed the following when doing some testing of the zxing library. The image below contains a UPC-A barcode and a QR code, but when the `CommandLineRunner` is run with `--multi --try_harder`, it finds a spurious EAN 8 barcode. I'm guessing this is because part of the barcode is creased and UPC-A and EAN-8 use the same encoding. It presumably picks up the creased UPC-A barcode ""part way through"", finding something like an EAN-8 encoding.

Please free to close this issue as ""won't fix"". The issue isn't likely to cause many problems in practice, and `--try_harder` is a mode which I presume is prone to false positives. My hope was that you might be interested in a tricky false positive example to add to your collection of test cases if a fix is possible.

Thanks for all your work on this excellent library!

zxing/zxing,closed,Fixed coding bug in QRcode encoding mask penalty rule #3 calculation,[],"A bug exists in the way zxing calculates the mask to apply during QR code generation.

Eight masks have to be tested and the one with the lowest penalty is chosen to be applied to the QR code being created. Each mask is scored on four criteria (rules), and rule 3 gives a penalty based on a particular sequence of black and white squares being present in the code. 

zxing uses two helper functions `isWhiteHorizontal` and `isWhiteVertical`  to test if a given range of cells are all white (=0). 

However, a bug in the functions makes them return `true` even if the range of cells is out of range. This results often in higher rule 3 penalty values and can end up with a QR code choosing a suboptimal masking pattern.

As this seems to have some relation to google, I understand why there is semi aggressive talk of ""third part app stores"" and the like. Google vs amazon.. but the reality is we developers need this tool on both amazon and play. We don't get to just make it for one of the android platforms. If the tool doesn't work on all platforms then its a pretty poor tool. No major venture could hope to use this library. The fix would be a simple official release from you all to the app store, and 2 lines of code to direct it to the correct store.

Wouldn't be a major issue, if the library is easily turned into a jar and thus would be free of ""what store"" the user has access to. I've been poking at this with that in mind. Easy is not how I would describe it. I have seen several contributors saying that its desired I don't do exactly that.

I generated a QR code using wolframalpha (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=qr+code+for+%27%29%3B+DROP+TABLE+user%3B+--) with the text '); DROP TABLE user; --

I think the I set the error correction level to Q but I'm not sure. 

When I scanned the QR code everything was displayed as usual and nothing strange happened. When I tried to open a different app using the camera a message came up, that the camera could not be opened.

Then I tried to close the Barcode scanner but the view of the running apps kept disappearing. Then cm crashed and after reboot none of the SIMs were recognized. Some things still worked. Others didn't. Even after flashing cm again I can't charge my phone.

I'm not sure if this is caused by an SQL injection. ATM I'm not able or willing to try to reproduce.

zxing/zxing,closed,False error alert when generating QRCode on Android device without GooglePlayServices.,[],"Pretty much all in the title, but..

When generating a QRCode on an Android device without GooglePlayServices an error alert pops up for a split second and then goes away. The error alert says ""This app won't run without Google Play services, Which are missing from your phone."" Though the app runs fine and the QRCode is successfully generated.

I understand why this may happen when attempting to scan a QRCode. Because, to my understanding (as I've only implemented generation, not scanning), it relies on Intents and the Google Play Store to open up a scanner app. But I don't see why this false alert pops up when generating a QRCode, because generation doesn't rely on any Google Play services, but maybe I'm overlooking something.

This isn't a huge bug, as most of the Android users have Google Play services on their device, and the QRCode appears to be successfully generated. Also, the alert is only on the screen for a split second. But it would be good if we could stop the false error alert from popping up all together.

Here's the error alert:

We are solved that problem using the Zbar and the Zxing library in one application. If the Zxing can't decode the QR code, our application use the Zbar library.

Now, in some devices fail the QR code determination both with the Zbar and the Zxing library, but the QRDroid successfully decoded the QR Data(with the Zapper engine).

I have got the latest Barcode Scanner application (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=hu).
From the previous issue, i have got two QR code with the same data structure, the first  one is lower contrast and not too good image quality, and the second one with good contrast and very high image qulaity.

The QRDroid application read all of the QR codes(with the Zapper engine), but the Zxing(Barcode Scanner application) only read the QR 2(marked in the image).

Can you suggest me some solution? What can I do to fix this issue?

There is no issue to read 2D-Doc with zxing.

The only issue is about generation because 2D-Doc only uses ASCII encoding and does not optimize the encoding.

This patch:
- modify HighLevelEncoder to allow bypass of encodation optimization
- provide a new specific writer: DDDocWriter
- provide a 2D-Doc encoder
- provide some local changes to glue all the stuff

This is my first attempt with zxing, so I am waiting for your feedbacks to improve this proposal.

It works quite well, but it seems optimal when the damatatrix is pretty small in the global image (datamatrix width less that half the global image width).
When the datamatrix takes the whole image, xzing cant read it, until i unzoom enough.

Impact:
Most null pointer issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a null pointer dereference, the attacker might be able to use the resulting exception to bypass security logic or to cause the application to reveal debugging information that will be valuable in planning subsequent attacks.

Recommendation:
Implement careful checks before dereferencing objects that might be null. When possible, abstract null checks into wrappers around code that manipulates resources to ensure that they are applied in all cases and to minimize the places where mistakes can occur.

Impact:Do not use realloc() to resize buffers that store sensitive information.  The function might leave a copy of the sensitive information stranded in memory where it cannot be overwritten.

Fix:If sensitive information is stored in memory and there is a risk of an attacker having access to a memory dump, replace realloc() with explicit calls to malloc(), memcpy(), and free(). This approach gives you the opportunity to safely scrub the contents of the original buffer before it is freed.

zxing/zxing,closed,Android project displaying QR-code can not find zxing classes in the jar files,[],"Good evening,

I am trying to create [a simple Android app](https://github.com/afarber/android-newbie/tree/master/QREncoder), which would display a QR-coded image.

So I have installed HomeBrew, ant and maven at my Mac OS Yosemite notebook and pointed the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to the location of Android SDK.

Then I have checked out latest zxing from GitHub and built it (seeming without any errors) with the command `mvn package` (and using javac version 1.8.0_45).

After that I have created a new Android project with blank Activity in Eclipse and copied the 3 jar files into its libs directory:

```
android/libs/core-3.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
android-core/target/android-core-3.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
android/target/android-4.7.4.jar
```

Unfortunately, my simple code in [MainActivity.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afarber/android-newbie/master/QREncoder/src/de/afarber/qrencoder/MainActivity.java) does not compile:

```
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    ImageView imageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.qrCode);
    String qrData = ""Data I want to encode in QR code"";
    int qrCodeDimention = 500;
    QRCodeEncoder qrCodeEncoder = new QRCodeEncoder(qrData, 
        null,
        Contents.Type.TEXT, 
        BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE.toString(), 
        qrCodeDimention);

    try {
        Bitmap bitmap = qrCodeEncoder.encodeAsBitmap();
        imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
    } catch (WriterException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

The errors are (here [Eclipse-screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ycE15.png)):

```
BarcodeFormat cannot be resolved
Contents cannot be resolved to a variable
QRCodeEncoder cannot be resolved to a type
QRCodeEncoder cannot be resolved to a type
WriterException cannot be resolved to a type
```

But at the same time I can see these (supposedly not found by Eclipse) classes by calling tar tool:

```
# tar tvfz libs/core-3.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar | grep -i WriterException
-rwxrwxrwx  0 0 0 0 28 Mai 20:35 com/google/zxing/WriterException.class
# tar tvfz libs/core-3.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar | grep -i BarcodeFormat
 -rwxrwxrwx  0 0 0 0 28 Mai 20:35 com/google/zxing/BarcodeFormat.class
# tar tvfz libs/android-4.7.4.jar | grep -i QRCodeEncoder
-rwxrwxrwx  0 0 0 0 28 Mai 20:39 com/google/zxing/client/android/encode/QRCodeEncoder.class
```

What am I doint wrong please, why can't Eclipse find the classes?

zxing/zxing,closed,Add a prefix to Maven artifacts,[],"Perhaps in the next major version you could add a prefix to the maven artifact names so that the jars get a decent name in non-library upstream projects (ie WAR)?

Right now the jars will have the nondescript and confusing names of `core-x.x.x.jar` and `javase-x.x.x.jar` in a canonical Maven WAR. The ostensible industry standard seems to be to prefix your artifact names with the project name.

``` xml

    <artifactId>zxing-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>

There are of course work-arounds (such as never name any of your artifacts `core` or configure: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/file-name-mapping.html )  so I understand if this bug/encancement is considered trivial or not really worth doing.

Summary: Method should get rid of repeated specific characters, but it do not. 

Able to be reproduced? (Yes/No): Yes

What is the problem and how can it be reproduced?
The Javadoc for the method splitQuery, inside class DecodeHintManager, states that the method should ignore repeated specific characters, such as double ampersands, using only the first one. After unit tests, we find out that it although it ignores the repeated characters, the final result will be different as if you had only a single specific character.

zxing/zxing,closed,poor performance using core in own app,[],"hi,

we implemented your zxing/core source in our app and see that it takes 2-4 seconds to scan a 1d barcode from camera preview.

your zxing app does this in just milliseconds. do you have any tipps for us to do the scan faster.
in other words: does the decode function in your app the same work as in an ""own"" app.

the purpose of this question is, to get a hint if we have to investigate inside the zxing source or in the camera preview things which gives the info to the decoder.

best regards, reinhard

It would be nice if zxing could produce a nice tasker/locale plugin or whatever to allow some fully automated use to be set up on device like that.

https://github.com/zxing/zxing/commit/c815a4babb3708f1ae3e1115bb5dbb61d50cd4b8:
This adds the rectangles to the datamatrix definition tables.

This changes the threshold for determining a rectangular datamatrix form. This is necessary, because the old threshold excluded some of the new rectangles. It has the side effect of test failures in the datamatrix code, but AFAICS it has no effect on the functionality itself.

zxing/zxing,closed,Scan via browser URL seems to cache redirect and return to wrong location,"[Label(name=""android""), Label(name=""bug"")]","I have developed a simple web app we use for tracking boxes at work which updates a database.

The boxes all have barcodes attached.

This is somewhat simplified, but for the purposes of this bug report I have two pages in the web app:
- Look up a box
- Add a new box

On the ""add a new box"" page I have a button which links to Barcode Scanner with a URL like:
http://zxing.appspot.com/scan?ret=https%3A%2F%2Fmyserver.example.com%2Faddbox.php%3F%26xid%3D%7BCODE%7D

On the ""look up a box"" page I have a similar button but it links to a different URL:
http://zxing.appspot.com/scan?ret=https%3A%2F%2Fmyserver.example.com%2Flookupbox.php%3F%26xid%3D%7BCODE%7D

However, I find if I go to ""add a new box"", scan a barcode with a particular value (doesn't seem to matter what type of barcode, I've reproduced with code 128 and with QR code), I am redirected correctly. But if I later go to ""look up a box"" and scan the same barcode, it returns me to addbox.php not lookupbox.php even though the link on the ""look up a box"" page was definitely correct.

If I scan a different barcode on the ""look up a box"" page I'm correctly redirected to lookupbox.php. If I clear all zxing's app data, and go to the ""look up a box"" page, and scan the same barcode, I'm also correctly redirected to lookupbox.php.

It looks like zxing is somehow caching the ret= value along with a particular barcode and refusing to change it on a later scan of the same code.

This breaks my web app's functionality. I guess the only way I can really work around it is by redirecting all scans to the same scan.php page and then using PHP session variables or something to tell scan.php where I really want to be redirected to. This is, quite obviously, a pain.

I'm using Barcode Scanner version 4.7.0 on a Sony Xperia Z2 running Android 4.4.4.

zxing/zxing,closed,DataMatrixWriter generates wrong BitMatrix,[],"When trying to encode the string ""_DTCP01"" (without quotes), the DataMatrixWriter delivers a wrong BitMatrix. The BitMatrix represents the string ""_DTCP04 47"" (without quotes).

The issue is easy to reproduce with the given string. Other examples work.

This is actually a very annoying issue, since the reason for the behavior is not clear. Seems to be somehow related to the leading asterix.

Remark:
Barcode4j has the same issue. IText's BarcodeDatamatrix renders the barcode as expected.
As far as I understood the zxing package history, the DataMatrix implementation is based on Barcode4j - so maybe this is an inherited issue.

I have a page with multiple datamatrix codes, but the decoding process with zxing always fails. 
I tried to decode with clearImage from inlite and it just works fine?

Looking forward to here from you soon.

            BinaryBitmap bitmap = new BinaryBitmap(new HybridBinarizer(
                    source));

            DataMatrixReader dataMatrixReader = new DataMatrixReader();

            Hashtable<DecodeHintType, Object> hints = new Hashtable<DecodeHintType, Object>();
            hints.put(DecodeHintType.TRY_HARDER, Boolean.TRUE);
            // Result decode = dataMatrixReader.decode(bitmap,hints);

I use zxing with cordoba for ticketing purpose and would like to reduce the delay after scanning to go back to the application. However the DEFAULT_INTENT_RESULT_DURATION_MS seems not taken into account when I set it to 1L. The message stays displayed during 2 seconds.

Could you try on your side ?

zxing/zxing,closed,qrcode margin increases when content increases and eventually the qrcode shrinks in size.,[],"This is a weird issue. When the content for vCard increases, the margin around qrcode increases.
In my code I am setting 'MARGIN' to 0 in 'com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType' and this is how I want it.
But what I noticed was that if the name name is long, then the qrcode strinks in size. I need the qrcode to be of 300 x 300 size. 

I am generating these qrcode using MRI ruby 2.1.1 with zxing/core jar in a Rails(v 4.1.0) web app.
ATM i am using an older version(not sure which version) but I have tried with version 3.1.0 and I am getting the same result.

Below are some sample I have generated with my code and older version of core jar. Notice the 3rd qrcode is smaller even though all images are of  same size.
Does anyone know a fix to this issue. Please help me out here.

zxing/zxing,closed,Ability to disable history saving ,"[Label(name=""android""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","A hopefully quick, easy one. I use Barcode Scanner with an alarm clock app to scan a bar code and return its contents to the alarm clock app, which decides whether or not the scanned Barcode is the one required to disable the alarm. However once I have scanned the Barcode a single time, it appears in the History section and allows me to click it and return the Barcode's contents to the alarm app without actually having scanned the code, therefore defeating the point of the app (getting out of bed to scan the code). 

So the issue boils down to: can there be a way to implement the disabling of Barcode history in the app, so lazy people like me can get up in the morning? Many thanks indeed.

zxing/zxing,closed,Code 128 scan at an angle return a UPC-E with different value,[],"Good day

When I scan a Code 128 barcode and rotate the scanner a bit the value returned is different than the actual barcode value.

About 1% to 2% of the scans returned invalid value.
I scan a Code 128 barcode with a value of 4001599 and the following returned on a good scan:

result.text=4001599 
result-format=CODE_128 
result.cancelled=false

Then when the scan is not 100% in the window or a bit at an angle I get the following result on the same barcode.

result.text=18112146 
result.format=UPC_E 
result.cancelled=false 

My conclusion is that the UPC_E does not calculate a check digit.
Sometimes the scan only capture a part of the barcode and interpret it as a UPC-E barcode.

Is there any possibility for this to get fixed?

zxing/zxing,closed,ByQuadrantReader - QRCode ResultPoint coordinate,[],"Hi,
I understand QRCodeMultiReader().decodeMultiple scans the entire image trying to find QRCode and it usually fails when there are multiple QRCodes close to each other.  However, whenever it does detect a QRCode, it will report the absolute image coordinate in the ResultPoints.

ByQuadrantReader does a much better job of detecting multiple QRCodes in an image, but ResultPoints appears to be relative to the quadrant instead of to the image.  Is there a way for ByQuadrantReader to provide the absolute image coordinate in ResultPoints?

For example:
QRCodeMultiReader().decodeMultiple would give:
""MyQRCodeText""
(746.5,634.5)
(744.5,549)
(835.0,545.5)

ByQuadrantReader  would give:

According to GB/T 18284—2000, the GB2312 Range is:

1. User visits webapp/webpage.
2. App checks for xzing http sever.
3. Is the server running? If not, prompt to install, or open using intent URL that triggers the service to start.
4. zxing http server now running.
5. User clicks on ""scan barcode"" button.
6. Http requests are made every second to the zxing server url (ie http://localhost:8080).
7. The server returns two things:
    a. base64 encoded image of what the camera is seeing at that point
    b. the captured barcode data (returned once for every barcode recognition).
8. The javascript app show a small dialog to display the base64 image data and has a button to stop the barcode recognition.
9. A callback is issued every time a barcode is received.

This would produce seamless integration for web-apps :-D

Even the native camera app does not work at this state.
After a restart everything works again (for about 1-4 scans).
I never had these problems before I installed the Barcode-Scanner-App - so I gues the problem belongs here!?

I also tested this with a Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 (Android 4.2.2) - there are no errors - everything works as expected.

zxing/zxing,closed,Open links with non-http(s) scheme,[],"When scanning a barcode containing a link that doesn't have http(s) as scheme, only the host:port/path portion is recognized as link and clickable, e.g.:

QR code contains: opc.tcp://test.samplehost.com:4841

We're developing an Android application that has the opc.tcp scheme registered and would open if a link was clicked with the opc.tcp scheme. Using Barcode Scanner this is not possible, as it opens test.samplehost.com:4841 in the browser. Please improve the URL parser to detect non-http(s) schemes and allow to click them.

zxing/zxing,closed,PDF Barcode generation giving strange results,[],"Platform: Android 4.0+
Zxing Version: 3.0.1
Barcode Format: PDF417

Since CP437 encoding isn't present on Android I've tried setting different encodings to render a PDF417 barcode but it is prepending extra characters that vary based on the encoding.

US-ASCII
Prepends with 'A'

ISO-8859-1
Prepends with 'AB'

UTF-8
Prepends with 'A\s'

UTF16 prepends stranger characters and actually loses a character from the original source.

Using the following to set the Character set
hints.put(EncodeHintType.CHARACTER_SET, ""US-ASCII"");

Is there anyway to prevent the rendered barcode from prefixing these characters?

Is there a way to stop this? Stopping people from encoding programs into bar codes is impractical. But can you also control users and their system so that the reader _never_ gets the permission to execute?

I assume the error occurs with multiple PDF 417 images. I have received it with 2 images. One of those images was printed from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417.

zxing/zxing,closed,please provide j2me builds,[],"zxing is a big project (127 megs tar.gz) and not everyone is able (as in tools, resources, time, skills) to build it (in my case, compiling this with 56 kbps, 600 mhz on a USB stick device without JDK, ant, ... installed isn't very appealing).
On the other side there are still a lot of j2me platform running nowadays and all others (non-free) QR-reader for mobile phones provide a click & install .jar/.jad couple.

I think it would be really appreciated to provide builds (a least of some major releases) of a j2me zxing midlet (especially since all developpers of the project already have this very .jar compiled in their zxing source directory and that uploading this would be straightforward)

```

The `initialized` field was not thread-safe which allowed multiple threads to call `initialize()`. This concurrent re-initialization would potentially allow mutations to be observed in `expTable` and `logTable` during encoding operations. Even if re-initialization did not occur, there is no guarantee that the initialization of these tables is visible on other threads because those initializing mutations occur outside of a synchronized context. Adding a double-checked lock and a nested holder class ensures that these shared resources are initialized once, visible to all threads, and never change.

I spent a while reviewing the code and came to the conclusion that this is the only possible explanation for the exception above. I was also able to generate corrupt `QRCode`s quite frequently due to this issue. That problem should also be addressed by this fix.

zxing/zxing,closed,Support for WPA-Enterprise?,"[Label(name=""android""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello

We just stumbled upon the problem that we want to grand our members (4k+) access to our distributed wifi network which uses 802.1X for authentication.
Currently the scanner supports only ""open"",""WEP"", ""WPA"" and ""WPA2"".

According to my current understanding of the code (if I missed something please tell me) there are only the files 

core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/client/result/WifiResultParser.java
core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/client/result/WifiParsedResult.java

which generate the config and is parsed to the Android manager later. According to the Android documentation the WifiConfiguration accepts ""public WifiEnterpriseConfig enterpriseConfig"" with all neccessary sub-options like ""public int getPhase2Method ()"" etc. However testing in our network (with it's current configuration) using an QR-Code was not successful. 

Am I wrong? If yes I would like to know where my mistake is.
If you need further information in order to reproduce the issue don't hesitate to contact me.

zxing/zxing,closed,Problems with QRCode scanning on a Sony Xperia Z1,[],"Hi,

we are currently using ZXing 2.3.0 in our project to integrate a QRCode scanner. The scanning works fine on all Android devices except of the Sony Xperia Z1. Here it takes several attempts to scan a QRCode. 

To eliminate some implementation mistakes we also tried out the ZXing Test scanning application provided by your team and we try around with the provided settings - but without any success. Last we tried to use the newest release version (3.0.0) also without feeling any improvements.

Are there any known issues with this mobile / ZXIng constellation? Maybe the problem is the huge amount of megapixel (20,7). Currently Android version 4.3 is installed on our Sony Xperia Z1 mobile.

Or is there any other approach to get it working on this device?

Cheers

For those users, their phones are not even trying to autofocus on the barcode with default-settings in zxing.

I was able to workaround this problem by unchecking the checkbox ""No continuous focus"" in the zxing-settings page and recommended this workaround to users who reported this problem. I also initiated an updated description of our apps' playstore-page to notify new users about this.

As both S3 and S4 are very popular smartphones among our users, would it be possible to auto-apply this setting to those devices during init of camera-preview?
Or to show a message via toast or Dialog to users that have issues without autofocus?
Maybe this could be detected by measuring how long the camera-preview is open and if open longer than 10 seconds, show a toast-message to the user hinting at the settings?

Or maybe there is a better solution?

Thank you for your support!

Since Android does not have the `Cp437` charset, or at least it doesn't in some versions, it is important to avoid `Charset.forName(""Cp437"")` until really necessary. Encoding, for example, PDF417 will still fail if this charset is used, but not all PDF417 encoding modes use it.

Also, it should try the alternate name `IBM437` for the charset.

zxing/zxing,closed,Try to re-add fragment support,[],
zxing/zxing,closed,Android - Fragment Support,[],"Hi Sean

Currently your android implementation (IntentIntegrator) takes an Activity as an argument and it's startActivityForResult() method is called on the Activity you pass it. This is fine when it's that activity calling the scanning intent, but becomes a bit messy when calling the scanner from a fragment. The resulting onActivityResult() call is handled first by the Activity, as per the android activity lifecycle. (Activity.startActivityForResult()...)

In my case, the Activity is housing multiple Fragments and it's a bit messy when passing down the results.

My question is this: Is there a way to call and return on a fragment in the existing codebase? I stumbled on code by Lachezars in 2012 which was removed from trunk that supported V4 fragments. It's basically just a wrapper that overrides startActivityForResult() and I updated it to handle android.app.Fragment. Is this perhaps the correct thing to do, or should i leave it alone to avoid copyright issues?

I have gone through the google discussion held in 2012, but i'm worried the code being removed from trunk might indicate i'm missing something for current fragment support.

zxing/zxing,closed,Is it possible to reduce the quiet zone required for QR code decoding?,[],"Hello,

I am using zxing on an embedded system for recognizing QR codes on a surface (like thousands of codes on a piece of paper).
I need to reduce the quiet zone, so that I can increase drastically the precision of the device (the more QR codes I can put in a certain area, the better).

So, I reduced the MARGIN to 1 (0 seemed impossible to use as I know that zxing uses the quiet zone to define the QR code.
But I also noticed an extremely decrease in performance.

I was wondering, having a very small QR code (right now using around 100x100px), is shouldn't matter that much. The quiet zone is surely larger than anything in the code, so its recognition shouldn't be a problem.

Is there a way for me to reduce the 'standard' quiet zone (4) for decoding to something smaller, say 1?

zxing/zxing,closed,Specify allowed EAN extensions as a hint,[],"Related to this question:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8544503/zxing-scanning-barcode-with-upc-5-supplemental

The use case is an application that needs to scan EAN-13 + EAN-5 barcodes, optionally also needing to allow other formats (e.g. QR codes), but not EAN-13 by itself.

The actual decoding of EAN-5 works perfectly. The problem is that most of the time, the barcode scanner picks up the normal EAN-13 part before it found the EAN-5 extension, and returns only that. I've also found that it sometimes only returns the first two characters, as if it was an EAN-2 extension.

This change allows you to specify a hint to not return any EAN/UPC barcode, unless it found an extension of the specified length (EAN-2, EAN-5 or both).

This is the least obtrusive way I've found to allow scanning of EAN-13 + EAN-5 barcodes, while still allowing it to be used with other formats in MultiFormatReader.

An alternative and slightly more flexible solution would be to add formats like EAN_13_WITH_EAN_5, but there are no many combinations to make this practical.

zxing/zxing,closed,Support for Code B FNC characters,[],"I have a need to generate FNC characters for a scanner we are using. Previously the Code128Writer would crash for FNC characters, even though they were allowed in the input string. It correctly would set Code B, but if one of the ESCAPE_FNC_\* characters were present, it would crash with an ArrayOutOfBoundsException since the escape characters were not in the mapping array. I've added the mapping to the correct Code B characters.

Unless I'm missing something there aren't any lot of tests around Code128Writer. I've added a test case and exercised the Code B code. It's not exhaustive but it tests my use case. I'd appreciate direction on what should be tested here - my knowledge of barcodes is pretty much the Wikipedia article.

Hello, I am being working on decodeing a kind of 2D barcode called ""Hanxin Code"" or ""Chinese-Sensible Code"". It's a type of 2D matrix code, very similar to QR Code. However, the finder pattern is not like the one in QR Code, it is not symmetric in both horizontal and vertical direction. How to locate the finder pattern when the code is rotated(for example, rotate 45 degrees) has puzzled me for a while. Is there anyone can help me? many thanks!!!

If it is expected to throy, I guess it should be handled at most in ResultParser.parseResult as this method should then try the next Parser.

zxing/zxing,closed,Feature Request: Add the ParsedResult as part of IntentResult,"[Label(name=""android""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This applies to android-integration. Currently, IntentIntegrator#parseActivityResult returns an IntentResult, which has a getContents() method returning a String.

In a lot of use cases, this String is not very helpful - it has to be parsed using the appropriate ResultParser anyway. This can of course be done as follows (taking the example of WiFi result):

```
IntentResult scanResult = IntentIntegrator.parseActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
Result result = new Result(scanResult.getContents(), null, null, BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE);
WifiParsedResult parsedResult = (WifiParsedResult) WifiResultParser.parseResult(result);
```

However, this requires the addition of the core.jar as a dependency. It seems overkill to add a 500KB+ dependency just for parsing the result (particularly since the ability to parse the result is already present in the Barcode Scanner app itself). 

I was able to avoid this by copying the following files into my project and making minor modifications to eliminate all parsers except the WifiResultParser:
- BarcodeFormat.java
- MathUtils.java 
- ParsedResult.java
- ParsedResultType.java 
- Result.java
- ResultType.java
- ResultMetadataType.java
- ResultParser.java
- ResultPoint.java
- TextParsedResult.java
- WifiParsedResult.java
- WifiResultParser.java

But since this is a frequent requirement, I propose to enhance the IntentResult API to also include the ParsedResult itself - exposed as a getParsedResult() method. I realize this is pretty simple thing to do and I would have made the changes and issued a pull request myself. However, this calls for a decision to be made that is best left to the project authors:

How to deal with exposing the ParsedResult and sub-classes to an Android app that uses IntentIntegrator? 
- Would you move these classes to the android-integration module? This would require the Barcode Scanner app to include android-integration as a dependency.
- Would you rather move these files to a separate module and add this module as a dependency for both Barcode Scanner app and the android-integration module?

zxing/zxing,closed,"ITF wide bar width, bar wide to narrow ratio",[],"Hi,

in source file 

core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/oned/ITFReader.java on line 50 we have:

private static final int W = 3; // Pixel width of a wide line

in comment you write ""Wikipedia is a great reference for Interleaved 2 of 5 information""
and on Wikipedia site we have: wide line (2.0 to 3.0 times the width of a narrow line).

I implement ""Wide To Narrow Ratio"" in my barcode generator

http://www.generatorkodowkreskowych.pl/en/itf-14/
http://www.generatorkodowkreskowych.pl/en/2of5-interleaved/

You can generate ITF codes with diffrent wide line width (2 to 3 times the width of a narrow line)

For PNG images you can use:

at scale 100% (narrow bar = 1) and WTNR in [2, 3]                     wide bar = 2,3
at scale 200% (narrow bar = 2) and WTNR in [2, 2.5, 3]                wide bar = 4,5,6
at scale 300% (narrow bar = 3) and WTNR in [2, 2.33, 2.66, 3]         wide bar = 6,7,8,9
at scale 400% (narrow bar = 4) and WTNR in [2, 2.25, 2,5, 2.75, 3.0 ] wide bar = 8,9,10,11,12

For PDF files you can use:

scale in range 80% to 200%, Wide To Narrow Ratio in range 2.00 to 3.00 with 0.01 step.

I make tests:

generate codes with Wide/Narrow = 2, and with Wide/Narrow = 2.5, and Wide/Narrow = 3
print codes and read with manual barcode reader Argox AS-8000.

Your barcode reader can not read ITF barcode with Wide To Narrow Ratio = 2,
but can read Code-39 with Wide To Narrow Ratio = [2,3].

I assume this information can help you to improve ITFReader.

zxing/zxing,closed,Implement Share Intent,"[Label(name=""android""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Most of the time I want to forward a scanned URL (or some other data) somewhere so I can later check it out, usually with a laptop. This is currently not that easy:
1. Scan a QR code URL
2. Barcode Scanner shows buttons to open browser, share with email or SMS

Have a Share UI element which shows all the apps registered for sharing

A workaround currently is to open the scanned link in the browser and select ""Share Page"" which gives the option to share the link with a multitude of apps, including email and SMS.

However, this requires many steps and is slow and inconvenient. In some cases the browser gets redirected to a mobile site making it impossible to share the original URL. Sometimes the browser can't even open the URL, or proceeds to download the content.

zxing/zxing,open,MECARD / vCard encoding should delimit fields,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Address / city / state / postal code and so on are supposed to be separated in MECARD and vCard, by comma and semicolon, respectively. The code right now doesn't break this down beyond an address field though, so isn't able to format accordingly. 

Ideally the online encoder would have separate fields for address components. And, in Android, would retrieve address elements independently. However I am not sure Android breaks this out either, not via Intent.

zxing/zxing,closed,Need to handle onSurfaceChanged() in Barcode Scanner?,[],"A user reported this exception:

```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Requested window android.os.BinderProxy@xxxxxxxx does not exist
```

In looking at possible causes I see that we may not be implementing onSurfaceChanged(), when it may be needed to handle rotations. This should cause the camera to re-init with a new surface. This may be one of those situations that never actually came up in practice but is still wrong.

zxing/zxing,closed,Proposal for decoding of GS1 compliant datamatrix codes,[],"Hi together,

I often scan GS1 compliant datamatrix codes with zxing (which is lovely, btw.). Unfortunately they were not decoded into the different application identifiers (with their values).

I added a parser to decode and format the content. The major changes are in the core library. 
I'm a bit uncertain if decoding countries and currencies from the three digit iso codes is a good idea, as they are more or less likely to change.

If the code lacks of further tests or needs some tweaking to meet your quality standards, please let me know. Unfortunately I formatted the core\pom.xml what messed it up a bit in the diff :-(.

Cheers,

Melchior

PS: I noticed that your primary repo is a google svn. I don't have a google login (and it's not likely I'll have one in the future), so I'm not able to commit the patch there.

zxing/zxing,closed,Pdf417 merge,[],"The main changes are handling of ambiguous values, a few bug fixes, code cleanup, adding a Macro PDF417 test case and a few bits and pieces of documentation.

Regarding the new test case for Macro PDF417 decoding: It's a quick hack and in order to keep the changes in the common classes to a minimum, it copies a lot of code from other classes and methods. To avoid this, I'd have to make quite a few methods protected and non final and add a few hooks in AbstractBlackBoxTestCase . For the same reason I copied TestResult.java into the package. How do you feel about allowing subclasses more access to AbstractBlackBoxTestCase and TestResult?

Best regards,

  Guenther
