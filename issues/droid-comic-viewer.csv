robotmedia/droid-comic-viewer,open,Nook buttons,[],"Hello! I use ""ACV"" version v1.4.1.4 on my nook (Android 1.6). As far as I know, your app is the best way to read CBZ on this ancient Android version.

If I had one wish, it would be that page turn would work with the nook's physical buttons. They actually work with most apps, I'm not sure why they won't work with yours. I can help diagnose/test the issue if you do not have a nook.

Thanks!"

How can I get the Android Billing Library?
Can I prase the source code of the https://github.com/robotmedia/AndroidBillingLibrary/tree/0153cf5bf3f41c79220bf8bdfa226e86e4dfd537 into your project?
Can you discuss it more?

Gingerbread phone with a small screen (480Ã—800), its an old'ish phone so small everything including memory :-) The device is a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Desire.

Message text is truncated when moving to (page 46) of a comic.

From grep'ing the source code it looks like `res\values\strings.xml` line 61:

```
<string name=""dialog_page_error_text"">Unable to load image. This generally happens because of an out of memory error.\n\nFor CBR/RAR files, try extracting into a folder and open the folder with a long tap.\n\nFor the rest, closing ACV and trying again after a while might help.</string>

robotmedia/droid-comic-viewer,open,Crash on phones without Google Play,[],"Steps to reproduce:
1. open Menu
2. select Settings
3. select About
4. select Google Play listing

On a phone without Google Play Store, this would cause a crash.
You may catch the exception, and then use this type of url to show the product on google play:
http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<package_name>

On phones sold on some markets, the Google Services are not present, so this may be a serious problem.

robotmedia/droid-comic-viewer,open,Crash when long-pressing a folder,[],"Crash on Nexus 4, ACV 1.4.1.4:
1. start the app
2. click menu
3. choose ""open""
4. go to directories like /mnt
5. long-press a folder, like ""secure""
6. crash

The reason is that, when you don't have permission, File.list() would return null. But this is not checked. The problem happens in src/net/robotmedia/acv/ui/SDBrowserActivity.java:111, where you called file.list() and later used the result. The return code may be null.

In this case, it's due to permission, so maybe it's not that interesting. However, it may also return null due to other reasons. Anyway, showing an error message is better than crashing.

robotmedia/droid-comic-viewer,closed,Allow Android file managers to open ZIPs with ACV.,[],"Some file explorers like Solid Explorer are currently only aware of ZIP-files.

robotmedia/droid-comic-viewer,open,App not properly handling premium status after data wipe,[],"I bought the premium version when it came out. When JB came out I had to wipe /data. Now I'm unable to get the app to accept that I have already bought it, even though Market pops up a message saying I already own it. In other apps I noticed that the same message comes up but clicking ok usually takes me back to the app and unlocks whatever functionality that purchase enabled.

It seems ACV app does not properly handle that response.

Also the code for loading images is scattered & somehow duplicated in several files (RarComic.getBitmapFromFileHeaderIfNeeded, ZipComic.getBitmapFromEntryIfNeeded, FolderComic.resampleAndSave) so that could maybe be refactored.
