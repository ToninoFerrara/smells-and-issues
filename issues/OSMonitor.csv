the README says: ""Due to Android 7.0's security enhancement, OS Monitor won't work any more, I decide to move the project into manitenance mode, it won't support Android 7.0 and following version.""

I decided to try it out anyway and installed version 3.5.0.6, which seems to work fine for me (needed to give it root permissions to be able to view all processes, but that's kind of expected). Is there something I'm missing, or is it maybe dependent on the device or custom firmware being used?"
eolwral/OSMonitor,open,Force-close only works in landscape mode,[],"Just discovered something odd. The force close button works in landscape mode, but when I switch to portrait mode, it no longer functions.

EDIT: Apparently it's that the popup's ""force close"" button doesn't work (in portrait or landscape), whereas the side panel's button does. Odd.

How is the popup being created? I don't see any UI controls declared with the text ""Force close"" other than the sidebar's/ProcessFragment's button. Is it generated based on the buttons in the sidebar?"

Line 232 it's in my opinion not necessary, because on line 231 takes readings of mac address value and trim it to the right length. Mac Addres length is 16 chars + \0 (end string mark) = 17 chars. strncopy(curMACAddr, readBuffer, 16) cuts last char.
I think that
`line 231: curMACLen = read(curMAC, curMACAddr, 17);` 
`line 232: delete it`
or 
`line 231: curMACLen = read(curMAC, readBuffer, 17);`
`line 232: strncpy(curMACAddr, readBuffer, 17);`

eolwral/OSMonitor,closed,Frequency Min > Frequency Max,[],"Hello!

In OS Monitor 3.3.0.5, there is a strange frequency bounds behavior. If I select any CPU frequency from Frequency Min menu, it instantly becomes back the maximum possible CPU frequency (1209000 on my chipset). But Frequency Max can be changed to each possible value (497250, 754000, 988000, 1209000) and remains until I leave CPU settings menu.

But when I enter CPU settings menu again, Min/Max frequencies are always the same, equal to max chipset frequency (1209000). Only governor setting persists.

I have Zopo ZP980/C2 (MT6589 chipset), Android 4.2.1 (the firmware from 18.08.2014).

Is such behavior normal for my chipset/OS, or there is a bug in OS Monitor?

Eugene

eolwral/OSMonitor,closed,Sum of Memory usage of processes,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Hi,

my xperia MK16i is low of memory (it has only 512MB!) an I want to find out, what processes are consuming the memory.

OSMonitor seems the right tool for this!

I did the following:
-  In the process list I sort after memory usage
- I made screenshots of this list and typed each amount in Excel
- I added each amount

The sum is much higher as ""Memory Total"" in the footer of the list: 529,3 MB (manual sum) to 356,4 MB (OSMonitor sum). How can this be?

How do you build the sum?

I attach you the screenshots and a Excel file screenshot to make it possible for you to reconstruct what I mean.

What type of memory does OSMonitor show in this list?

Can this list help me me at all to show, from what App the memory is assumted?

Best regards,

Onurbi

eolwral/OSMonitor,closed,Adding an option to display CPU time,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi, OSMonitor is a great app! Very useful and well-designed.

I think it's missing an important feature, the ability to display the total CPU time consumed by each process. 

Current CPU usage is useful to determine if an app is misbehaving, but won't help much to find if an application is a CPU hog only when it's being used by the user. For example, a recent weather app I installed eats massive amounts of CPU time when being used, but stays idle when it's not. So it would display ""0%"" CPU usage on OSMonitor and it was harder to detect that there was a problem with it.

Just a thought :)
