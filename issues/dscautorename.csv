ciubex/dscautorename,closed,Suggestion: send com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE after rename?,[],"First of all, thanks for this very useful app!

I've had a persistent problem when the OwnCloud app is running in the background: when a new picture is taken, `com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE` is detected both by OwnCloud and by DSC Autorename. However, the file is renamed faster than OwnCloud can upload it (and I would actually prefer the picture to be uploaded under its new name).

So my suggestion would be to also send `com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE` by DSC Autorename after renaming has happened, just this time with the new name, so that other apps can then react to the _new_ file.

Opinions?

ciubex/dscautorename,closed,Got old empty files,[],"Hay, i was in my phone today on the computer and notice i got alot of DSC_XXXX that not has been deleted, I¬¥m not sure if the program has rename the others and failed to just delete this ones or if it have try to rename them and somehow just trash the files I¬¥m not sure actually

I have it set now to rename the files 0s after them has been taken, but the camera app i have in my ""Xperia Z3+/Z4"" just show me first the the file i just take can¬¥t be used or not exist. And after some seconds it found it when its renamed and the mobile have find the new filename.

I¬¥m not sure if its anyway around this problem
