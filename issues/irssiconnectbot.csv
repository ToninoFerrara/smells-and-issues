irssiconnectbot/irssiconnectbot,open,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper: void onRestore(android.app.backup.BackupDataInput,int,android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor)>:[8,25]
<android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper: void addHelper(java.lang.String,android.app.backup.BackupHelper)>:[8,25]
<android.app.backup.BackupManager: void <init>(android.content.Context)>:[8,25]
<android.os.StrictMode: void setThreadPolicy(android.os.StrictMode.ThreadPolicy)>:[9,25]
<android.app.Service: void stopForeground(boolean)>:[5,25]
<android.text.AndroidCharacter: void getEastAsianWidths(char[],int,int,byte[])>:[8,25]
<android.app.Activity: android.app.ActionBar getActionBar()>:[11,25]
<android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper: void onBackup(android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor,android.app.backup.BackupDataOutput,android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor)>:[8,25]
<android.app.ActionBar: void hide()>:[11,25]
<android.view.MenuItem: void setShowAsAction(int)>:[11,25]
<android.app.backup.BackupManager: void dataChanged()>:[8,25]
<android.app.Service: void startForeground(int,android.app.Notification)>:[5,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

"
irssiconnectbot/irssiconnectbot,open,ConnectBot Control keys not working with ICS.,[],"Because ConnectBot handles control keys in a special way, it should be returning true back up the View hierarchy to indicate that the key was handled but from what I can tell using a debugger, this isn't always the case.

For example when typing Control-C on a Bluetooth keyboard.  Given a KeyEvent with action KEY_DOWN, metastate of META_CTRL_ON, and a keycode like KEYCODE_C, the ViewRootImpl dispatches the key event down the hierarchy as usual but ConnectBot doesn't seem to handle it and returns false.

As a result, the ViewRootImpl tries to dispatch the key as a shortcut instead, which causes the Copy action to be invoked.

To be honest, the code in the key listener to detect hard keyboards and handle them specially seems overly complicated.  Ideally, a keyboard is a keyboard.  At most, an application can determine whether a given key event came from a QWERTY keyboard (reduced built-in keyboard) or a FULL keyboard (PC-style keyboard).  It's best not to make too many assumptions about what these keyboard types really mean.

Apparently control keys used to work with ConnectBot prior to ICS although I haven't verified this.  We did change some subtle behavior related to dispatching shortcut keys in ICS, but that shouldn't have broken ConnectBot assuming it was handling control keys in the expected manner.
