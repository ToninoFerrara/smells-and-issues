biylda/WhereYouGo,open,WhereYouGo not running in background on Android 8.0,[],"Hi every one

Recently I wanted to play the cartridge “Bergsteigen” (3d1080c3-c3f3-4df7-b96c-0f4f2aebe343) but it didn’t work as expected in the WhereYouGo player.

Future analyses showed two problems occurring if the WhereYouGo player is running on Android 8.0.

1. If the phone gets locked, the app only gets only randomly some CPU time. So it can happen that the cartridge only gets called every few minutes what for some cartridge might not be enough. Here it would help if the WhereYouGo player offers an option to make a WakeLock (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock) call to the android API.


2. After installing a Wake Lock app on my phone the WhereYouGo player was working even if the phone was locked. But the mentioned cartridge still didn’t behave the way it should. I recognised that if the phone was locked the WhereYouGo player signalled several times an hour a GPS fix. This brought me to the following URL: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background-location-limits. Means that the WhereYouGo app is considered as a background app if the phone gets locked and only can get a few location updates an hour. It would be good if one of the mentioned functionality would be implemented to make the app even if the phone is locked recognised as a foreground app.

 

I think, those two issues could get to a real issue for the app as soon as Android 8.0 is more widely used.

 
Thanks Chris"

biylda/WhereYouGo,open,Problems with playing videos,[],"Hello,

first of all, thank you very much for your work.

I have problems to play videos a new feature from you. I tried different MP4 videos. Than I took a look into the code, and it seems, that the viedeo isn't started. With this stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17399351/how-to-play-mp4-video-in-videoview-in-android), I assume, that you have to start the video when the VideoView is prepared. Is this correct? Or do you have any cartridge to test this behavior?

In my cart I'm using 230px wide images as recommended by the whergio FAQs

Have just realised that the issue is only present with GIF images, If I use BMP, JPG or PNG they all stretch OK

biylda/WhereYouGo,open,Java Exception at resume game @ task.on_complete_changed,[],"Hi!

Hopefully this is the correct place to report potential bug as the exception references openwig.googlecode.com which seem to have move. 

Suprisingly a could't find this problem mentioned below, but probably I searched at the wrong places.

In the middle of the development of my cartridge - which work well in the urwigo-simulator also with no problems with save/and resume - I testet it on the smartphone: Lot's of java exceptions when I resumed a saved game: especially index of non-table and calling nil! I updated to the current version 
same result. 
So i started to analyse the problems. I am using tasks (also partly LUA-function in there). The problem at the resume-time seem to be, that the taskcompletion is called (which migth be ok and is ok to me), but there aren't any ""objects"" already ""initiated""!
So a call of e.g.:
- lua-function (call nil)
- setting an attribute of item, character,.. (index of non-table)
- move item to player
- ...

fail, as all ""the reference"" is  nil and I think this is bug. 

Of course I can implement a workaround, but I have to put it in many task ... 
So probably there is a simpler workaround (some settings) or I did something wrong, ...

I implemented an easy cartrige, to eliminate potential problem caused by me.
I attach this simple/short cartrige with no lua and just in urwigo (urwigo und compiled code attached) for reproduction of this problem:
1. Start cartrige
2. Schweizermesser.CloseTask
3. Exit with save
4. Start with resume -> java exception (just for a short time)
5. Exit no save -> java exception (til press away)

I'am currently working with urwigo and on an Samsung GT-S5690 Android: 2.36 /Gingerbread ( Kernel2.6.35.7).

If additional Information is need just let me know.

Thanx in advance for help or fixing the bug

biylda/WhereYouGo,closed,WhereYouGo reports Connection error,[],"Hi,

writing to you from the [c:geo](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo) developer team.
We recently posted on social networks that c:geo is able to start WhereYouGo from the cache listing and directly invoke download of the cartridge.
However some users replied (and we even have such a verified case on our support mail), that they get a connection error while WhereYouGo tries to login although correct logindata is stored and they are using the newest version available on GooglePlay.

Any ideas how to debug and fix?
Sadly for myself it is working flawless, so I can't be of any big help. It seems to be depending on the device or the user account.

Edit: Crossposted to https://github.com/Kim-tae-yong/android-whereyougo/issues/9 as I don't know which is the correct repo.
