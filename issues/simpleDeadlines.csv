chibibi/simpleDeadlines,open,Notification with zero deadline open,[],"Hello, I think there's a little bug.
There's no active deadline in the application, but every days I see an empty notification !! Boring ! 
Do you think that's a feature or a bug ? 
Thank's :-) 
"
chibibi/simpleDeadlines,open,Specific time for deadlines,[],"The ability to set a specific time during the day for each individual deadline would be pretty useful, instead of having the app countdown to midnight of the set day(which is what I assume it does), a countdown to the set time could be used. Further down the line, this could be expanded by having a detailed view which shows an active countdown in HH:MM:SS for the truly neurotic among us.

Since some of us have low end phones with limited disk space, this size for a simple\* app like this is questionable. I suppose the external libraries are the cause of the size increase, am I right? Is there a way to reduce the size?
- Disclaimer: My intention is not to disregard or to slur, I think this is app is very useful. I only try to start a discussion which could help improve the app.

chibibi/simpleDeadlines,closed,[Bug] Group is overwritten when Deadline is checked,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Whenever one checks a given deadline, the 'Group' of the checked deadline is reset to the default group, or as set in the preferences.

The problem seems to be in the condition [here](https://github.com/casimir/simpleDeadlines/blob/devel/src/main/java/com/casimirlab/simpleDeadlines/provider/DeadlineProvider.java#L247) in the `#update()` method.

Ideally one would want the default group set only when the user tries to explicitly update the group field to a whitespace or empty String(`""""`). Right now, if the group is not passed(`null`) to the `DeadlineProvider#update()`, it is simply overwritten instead of preserving the original value.
