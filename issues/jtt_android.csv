please consider implementing the option to display unicode emojis instead of text like so:

![emoji](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13608545/27236374-11b71e2c-52c5-11e7-95f0-d0bfb838a157.png)

aragaer/jtt_android,closed,The application crushing always on Android 7.1.2,[],"I updated my Nexus 6p, Android 7.1.2, then jtt is not working.
Uninstallation and reinstallation did not solve this problem."
aragaer/jtt_android,closed,Crashes when location doesn't match timezone,[],"When location set in the application doesn't match the actual timezone and the difference is big enough, it is possible that sunrise or sunset time for that location in current timezone is either before or after the local midnight. In this case the sunrise-sunset library will add or subtract 24 hours which would result in sunset for the day being earlier than sunrise. This in turn fails the assertion check when constructing the daylight interval object.

The solution that does work (it allows to start the application to actually set the correct location at least) is to do all the calculations in the timezone that is closest to the current location."

"
aragaer/jtt_android,closed,Wrong hour intervals,[],"While hours themself are calculated correctly, hour intervals should not start with those hours, but instead surround them.

Reason is that ""Hour of "" could refer to exact point of time (which is correct now) or it could denote a whole interval around it. While intervals between hours split days (and nights) into equal parts, intervals surrounding those hour points do not have to be equal. For hours of the Hare and the Cock the ""point"" is not even in the middle of the interval.

This requires certain changes in calculation and representation.
