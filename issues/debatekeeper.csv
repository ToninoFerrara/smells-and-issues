czlee/debatekeeper,open,Variations on World Schools Style,[],"Hi CZ, thanks for a great app. I just wanted to raise this as an issue first - I'm happy to make the XML files if you're happy to implement the styles.

I'm with Auckland Schools Debating and we had some feedback from teachers that it would be good if there were apps available that support timing. We have 5 world schools style grades, 3 of which are largely supported by the app.

Premier Advanced - World Schools
Premier Junior/Advanced Open - Thropy but 1 hour prep
Senior Open - 6 minute speeches, no POIs with one bell at 5 minutes
Junior Open - 5 minute speeches, no POIs with one bell at 4 minutes

I was wondering if it would be easier to add these styles as variations to World Schools, rather than as completely new styles  i.e.

Premier Junior/Advanced Open - World Schools (6 minutes)
Senior Open - World Schools (6 minutes, no POIs)
Junior Open - World Schools (5 minutes, no POIs)

We also have an additional Impromtpu Cup tournament modeled on NZ Easters, except with 5 minute speeches and one bell at 4 minutes which is a one off annual thing but would be nice to have. 

Let me know what your preferred approach to this is - I'd like to be able to promote this app with our teachers, especially in Junior/Senior Open which is teacher adjudicated, but you may think we should just stick to custom formats."
czlee/debatekeeper,open,Add to F-Droid,[],It would be neat to have this on https://f-droid.org/
czlee/debatekeeper,open,New icon,[],"So, I made this icon, which I think it goes much better with the current design of the app since it uses the Google Material Design notification icon as a bell and not the one drawn in the current logo.

Of course this is just a suggestion and I still keep the SVG file in case you want me to change anything.

czlee/debatekeeper,open,Add German translation,[],This branch contains both a straight-up translation of strings to German as well as a facility to specify 'multilingual' debate format files.
czlee/debatekeeper,open,Refresh Icon,[],"Hi,
I think the icon could be improved in a couple of ways:
* It's a white outline on a yellow background. This makes for poor contrast.
* The speech bubble shape makes it look a bit like an instant messaging app.
* The icon is not adaptive.
I tried to address these issues by adding a sort of drop shadow, toning down the speech bubble, and making the whole thing adaptive.

Basis for the changes was the previous icon, traced in Inkscape. The SVGs I used are included as well."

czlee/debatekeeper,open,Added American Parliamentary 5 Minutes styles,[],"This style is used at many Dutch debating unions and competitions. It would be awesome to add this style to the app! 

At our debating union some people have this custom xml file on their phone. But every time we start a American Parlimentry there is this stressfull moment of searching for a phone that contains this format. It would be much easier if everyone got this style with a app update.

I also notice that in Dutch debating tournaments, a lot of people are using this app to track time in the first four speeches (using the Britisch Parlementary format) and than manually track time for the whip speeches. I feel like adding this format natively to the app would make the debates calmer and more pleasant for everyone."
czlee/debatekeeper,open,Update README.md,[],"This small and useless PR adds two buttons to get the app in the README

Thanks for this app ;)"
czlee/debatekeeper,closed,Create Spanish translations,[],Didn't translate the Changelog dialog since the next version is going to show another thing. There's also some non-translatable lines there.

czlee/debatekeeper,closed,"Add ""Share"" feature for debate styles","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","It would probably work like this:
- [x] A ""Share"" button associated with any debate style would send the XML file (as the raw file) via whatever means, using a generic `Intent`
- [x] An intent filter would be added for all XML files, that give the option to be opened by Debatekeeper, and after checking that the first element is `<debate-format>` or `<debateformat>`, all it would do is copy it to the /debatekeeper directory
- [x] An ""Import"" item from the menu would launch a file chooser, and copy it to the /debatekeeper directory

Either that, or we invent a new file extension just for transfers.  Would probably prefer not to do it this way though.

Probably not worth having files exchanged in a way hidden to the user.
"
czlee/debatekeeper,open,Add American-style preparation time,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Suggested approach: The main counter always represents the _total_ prep time elapsed (including all stages), and the prep time used in this stage is a new set of methods. The brainwork is all done in `DebateManager`, _i.e._ `DebatePhaseManager` doesn't require modification.
- `DebateManager#resetActivePhase()` would discriminate prep times apart and _not_ call `DebatePhaseManager#reset()` if it is a distributed prep time phase, but instead just set stop the timer and set the current time to the total prep time allowed less the sum of all other stages.
- Prep time phases are specified by `<prep team=""affirmative"">` in the XML file, and as far as the app is concerned are just numbered from 0.
- Would need to override the period info description with the name of the next speaker.
- Would need new member `mPrepTImes` being a map of enums (for the teams) to a list of times.
- You can always calculate the time for this phase in `DebateManager` by subtracting the sum of all other phases from the time elapsed in this phase.
- Time elapsed in this phase is shown in smaller font where the POI button normally is, and _always_ counts up, never down as that would make no sense.
- No need to worry about length/overtime from GUI perspective, as these don't change.  What changes is the initial value of the timer, as it is set to the time remaining of all prep time stages.
- However, will need to update controls so that ""Start"" is displayed when the time remaining is equal to the total time available minus the time used in other prep time stages.

Then the phase index logic will have to be written to accommodation for distributed prep time.
