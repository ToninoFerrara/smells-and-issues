Cj-Malone/Screens,open,"Not working, no shortcuts created",[],"Moto Z Play, Android 8.0, stock/unrooted, Nova launcher in case it matters. Just downloaded this a while ago and have been messing around with it, but I can't get it to actually do anything. Clicking the star resulted in a message that a quick setting had been created, but I couldn't find anything from that. Clicking save said a shortcut had been created but, again, nothing. I tried a couple times. Based on some of the reviews, it appears I'm not alone, though I'm not sure if I'm just doing something wrong or if it's not working. It hasn't been updated in a year, so maybe it's not compatible with O."

Cj-Malone/Screens,open,Copyright violation,[],"Hi @Cj-Malone 

I found [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.Violet.screens) on the Google Play Store. This guy just took your source code, added some ads in it and put it on the Store, without warning this is free software...

As you are the owner of the source code, feel free to open a request to google [here](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_dmca?product=googleplay) to remove the false app from the Store, if it's your wish ;)

Don't forget to tell Google that:

* The app is licensed under BSD 2-clause ""Simplified"" License and this guy is violating it;
* He is falsely claiming he made the app;
* Provide screenshots of your own app and a link to this repo."
