#### Expected behavior
I expect the application to show a message prompt that reads ""data connection turned off"" or rather, it should open the selected browser, then a message in the browser notifies you of the turned off data connection.

Opening the page in the browser should be a function that is set in motion when the intended browser opens, such that the error of not having the data turned on would be displayed as a message by the browser when it opens. And not the application crashing before the browser even opens.

#### Actual behavior

The application crashes when the ""open in the browser"" button is clicked with the phone's data connection turned off.


#### How to reproduce
* download the app from fdroid store
* Turn off data connections
* launch app and allow permissions if prompted
* Click on the three dots at the top right corner of the display and the app crashes. However, the dialog box that allows for the selection of a browser pops up when the data connection is turned on.

I'm working on a tool that automatically introduces runtime permission checks and requests for Android 6 apps. As part of this study I analyzed this app. I was looking at the way permissions are referred in the code.

This app declares permission <ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION> in the apk manifest, but doesn't have any code that requires them. It is possible that source code doesn't declare the permissions. I only analyzed apk builds from f-droid. Yet android build mechanism may introduce them when the app uses certain libraries:

https://commonsware.com/blog/2015/06/25/hey-where-did-these-permissions-come-from.html

It won't create any problems on Android 6, but on Android 5- users may wonder why the app needs these permissions and be skeptical of installing the app.

Do you think this is an issue?
