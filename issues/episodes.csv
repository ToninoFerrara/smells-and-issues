@red-coracle appears to have the most well-developed fork. What do you say? Would you mind enabling issues on your fork so we could discuss development there?

Or perhaps jamie is willing to allow another dev to become an editor of the existing repo; this will make new versions much easier to be included in F-Droid?

jamienicol/episodes,open,Consider local timezone,[],"From my country, I usually can see the episode as un-watched instead of un-aired, because of timezone, it's about half day earlier than USA.

It would then be possible to switch manually the language from the global ""preferences"" menu.

I just upgraded from 0.8 to 0.9 (through the f-droid repository) and since then, the episodes tab for a show only shows a blank grey panel instead of the seasons list.

However, when I'm on the episodes tab and select the overview tab, the seasons list scrolls by _very_ fast before the overview shows up. Selecting episodes again after that brings back the gray pane.
It's possible to tap a season while they scroll past if you time it right, in which case the eoisodes for that season are correctly displayed.

jamienicol/episodes,open,Material design,[],"List of things to make the app more materially:
- [x] Pick a colour scheme. See here: http://www.google.co.uk/design/spec/style/color.html

  - [x] Animate change between transparent and opaque action bar when page is scrolled up far enough.
- [ ] Same thing for EpisodeActivity too.
- [x] Change the ""watched"" checkbox in EpisodeDetailsFragment's action bar to be ~~a floating action button~~. I tried this and it seems weird. It also goes against the guidelines. Instead I've just moved the checkbox out of the action bar and in to the fragment content.
- [x] Use RecyclerView for shows list.  I think this will give us animations when items are added/removed (changing the filter). But even if it doesn't it'll be an under-the-hood improvement.

These are just a few thoughts off the top of my head. If anybody has any more ideas then please leave a comment.

jamienicol/episodes,closed,handle special episodes correctly,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""wontfix"")]","feedback from anyone interested in this project would be appreciated here. thanks.

the specials season is annoying. most of the special episodes are things that most people won't care about like blooper reels, ""making of""s, and interviews. but they make it look like you haven't completed a show when you have.

the easy solution would be to hide/delete/never add the special episodes. but I don't think that's the right solution. some shows have important special episodes - one off episodes between seasons e.g. the thick of it. and some people maybe do care about watching absolutely everything related to their favourite show.

so I think a better solution (hopefully not too complicated) is to add the option to hide each episode individually. add a setting to automatically hide the special episodes when adding a new show. don't count hidden episodes when calculating how much of a show has been watched. and obviously there needs to be some way to temporarily view hidden episodes so that they can be unhidden.

I think this should cover most use-cases without being too complicated. any input would be appreciated though
