jarofgreen/Just-A-Damn-Compass,open,Fixes and tweaks,[],"Hey, thanks for the open source compass.  I don't know whether you are still maintaining this, but I've swapped the image for that of a real compass, put in a dial background, eliminated the jitter (on my phone, anyway), and put in an option to invert the colors (black/white).  Let me know what you think; hoping you will publish the changes.
