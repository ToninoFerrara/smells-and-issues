I can't think of a reason why this is important, so it's probably unintentional. This is literally the only app on f-droid that I can't do without; do I really have to turn on ""Uknown sources"" just for this one app?

duncanje/android-open-wifi-network-remover,closed,""" will be forgotten""",[],"When I connect to an Open WiFi with the app installed, the message "" will be forgotten"" is displayed in a message at the bottom of the display for a short period.

I assume that you are displaying the contents of a variable at the start (probably the SSID of the WiFi connection) but it seems that it is an empty string for me.

Tested on:
Phone: Samsung Galaxy SII (GT-I9100) with Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean)
Tablet: Asus Transformer Prime (TF201) with Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean)

Thanks for the great app.

PS: You might be interested to know that I have mentioned the app in a blog post I created recently : http://www.fubra.com/blog/2014/04/04/staying-safe-cyberspace/

Happy to throw any debug info your way if you like - I'm a systems engineer hence have a GitHub account :)

Cheers, Ben
