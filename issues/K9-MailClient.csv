since this fork appears not to be updated any more, I decided to try and update the underlying k-9 code to (at least) version 5.208, which includes some doze-related fixes.

I don't really know what I am doing, so please feel free to correct if I did something wrong / nonsensical. But at least on my computer the apk builds and it runs on my phone, so it seems that I must have done something right."
