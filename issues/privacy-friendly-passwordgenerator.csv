SecUSo/privacy-friendly-passwordgenerator,open,Multiple issues with the password generation algorithm,[],"A user of my [PfP](https://github.com/palant/pfp) pointed me to this app. Since I've done some (very cursory) analysis already, I thought that I would share the findings with you. The password generation algorithm as it is implemented right now has multiple issues:

* Combining PBKDF2 and Bcrypt makes no sense whatsoever. With the former being a considerably weaker algorithm, it would make far more sense to use Bcrypt exclusively.
* While the number of PBKDF2 iterations can be adjusted, even 10000 (the highest possible value) is far too low to be useful. See [my blog post](https://palant.de/2016/04/20/security-considerations-for-password-generators) on the issue here.
* The 10 Bcrypt rounds (hardcoded and not configurable) are better from what I can tell, but that's still a value which was considered acceptable five years ago - I guess that by today's standards it should be at least 12 rounds.
* Selecting a hash algorithm for PBKDF2 only helps confuse users, the choice of hash algorithm has no security impact whatsoever.

Finally, it is concerning that passwords generated are device-specific, as there is no way to recover passwords should that device fail."
SecUSo/privacy-friendly-passwordgenerator,open,insecure gradlew,[],"Just a minor adjustment, but could you please fix the gradle conf:

```
Found plain HTTP URL for gradle repository:

repositories{
    maven {
        url 'http://dl.bintray.com/amulyakhare/maven'

gradle build uses plain HTTP URLs for repositories!  This is insecure!

(fdroid build complains, pipeline breaks) Fix should be as easy as replacing `http` by `https` (URL works then) – but not being an Android dev I cannot verify that.

Thanks!"

SecUSo/privacy-friendly-passwordgenerator,closed,Fix wrong item selected when list is filtered,[],"The onClickListener does not take into account that the ids for entries in the password list change once a filter/search is applied. If searching for a specific password entry the list is filtered correctly, but when clicking on the entry the password generation dialog will be filled with the data of a different password list entry.

E.g. if you search for ""domain"" within the App's example data, it will show the correct entry in the list. But if you click on that entry, it will generate the password for the ""email"" entry (because that is the first entry in the unfiltered list)."

SecUSo/privacy-friendly-passwordgenerator,open,Clear master password after timeout,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi, 
It’s nice to be able to see the master password in clear text (typo is easy). But I’d like this feature to be limited in time. The master password should be hidden after a timeout (10 s), and should not be shown anymore unless it is typed again.

Why ? Because, sometimes my phone locks itself after I typed the master password and displayed it in clear text. When the phone is unlocked, the master password just appear in clear text. (and maybe, someone else could unlock my phone).
