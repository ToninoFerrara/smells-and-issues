grote/BlitzMail,open,Issue When Used With Tasker,"[Label(name=""needs info"")]","When I tried to setup a [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en) 'Compose Email' task, BlitzMail was failing where other e-mail applications (K-9 for example) were not. 

The task was to send an email with a bit of text for the subject and body and nothing else (so no attachments). When the task executed, BlitzMail would crash and I would be prompted to re-open it. However irregardless of if I did reopen it or not, a 'Sending BlitzMail' notification would appear. The email is never sent and the notification does not disappear (running the task again adds another similar notification).

Running Android 7.1.2 (LineageOS)

I got a workaround working by creating a custom Intent task in Tasker and using `text/plain` as the MIME type - the email sends as expected using this method. If I change the MIME type to anything besides 'text/plain', it crashes in a similar manner to before so I suspect that might have something to do with it. 

If this sounds like it's more on Tasker's end, feel free to close the issue and I can ping the developer. 



For anyone stumbling upon this with a similar problem, the solution I found was:
`A1: Send Intent [ Action:android.intent.action.SEND Cat:Default Mime Type:text/plain Data: Extra:android.intent.extra.SUBJECT:Test Extra:android.intent.extra.TEXT:Test Extra: Package: Class: Target:Activity ] `

The errors are just too frequent to think it is a random failure, already had over 20 in 3 days. Never had this type of failure while using google smtp when used in similar conditions.

grote/BlitzMail,closed,SMTP error 535 when debian-kit was launched before,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","Hello,

This may not be an issue for BlitzMail at all but I wanted to report it anyway: I have the latest Blitzmail installed from f-droid and everything works fine until I start Debian via debian-kit [1]. Then, I'll get the error ""Check SMTP settings: error 535 Authentication required"".

So far, I only managed to fix this with a reboot until the next launch of debian-kit.

So, it is obviously something what debian-kit does that stops Blitzmail from working. But as other mail sending apps (e.g. K9) continue to work, I thought it may be something that can be solved in Blitzmail. 

Let me know if you need any further details and also if you have some hints for me to explain the problem  better to the Debian-kit developer.

Thanks!
