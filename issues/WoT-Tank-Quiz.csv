MazeChaZer/WoT-Tank-Quiz,open,New kind of Quiz,[],"I saw your Quiz and got an Idea for an other one.

Since some time I started to Outsource Contacts and information from my Brain to my Mobil address book. But I realized more and more that this was not such a good Idea. In fact I have forgotten many about my contacts.

If you like it. Could you write a Quiz tool like you did for ""World of Tank"" for the Contact and Calendar Database?
