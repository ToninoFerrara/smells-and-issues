sudowars/sudowars,open,App hangs or crashes when creating a multiplayer game,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","In the current version 1.1, the app often hangs after the following steps:
1. create new multiplayer game
2. other player connects (status says 'connected')
3. other player hits the ready button
4. you hit the ready button

It's not 100% reproducible but it hangs ~70% of the time (tested numerous times with @fitefoe :smiley:). Devices used for testing are Galaxy Nexus (cyanogenmod 10.2.1) and Nexus 4 (cyanogenmod 10.1).

Otherwise: great game! :smile:
