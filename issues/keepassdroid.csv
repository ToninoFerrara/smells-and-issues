I use several databases. I use the recently used database list to open the one I need.
But nowadays, database paths are no longer meaningful and it is no longer possible to distinguish one database by looking at its path. Example of paths (for a database stored on Dropbox) : content://com/dropbox/android.FileCache/filecache/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (the database filename no longer appears !)

Would it be possible to associate to each path a Display Name ?
What is expected : Starting from the the recently used database screen, a long press on a database path will popup a menu (currently it exists with only a ""delete"" entry) with ""Add a name"". After adding a name, this name will be used in the recently used database list and allowing the user to easily distinguish one database from another.

Thanks in advance.

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,Interest in improved adaptive icon?,[],"Hello,

first thanks for the awesome app! It is my goto Keepass app on Android.
This issue is more a question about the launcher icon. I saw that in version 2.3.1 support for adaptive icons was introduced.
But it looks like the round icon is just plastered on the background, that then has the desired shape:
![screenshot_20180814-195531](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3579374/44109195-b443d736-9ffc-11e8-8059-5e2091857f6f.png)
The other icons look much more elegant and play nicely with the reshaping.
So I am asking whether you would be interested in redesigning the app icon with adaptive icons in mind.
I had a quick try, which you can see here [adaptive mockup](https://adapticon.tooo.io/#/bg=https://ptpb.pw/nGlm.png/fg=https://ptpb.pw/Kczd.png) in action.
Here is the mochup in the same shape as in the screenshot:

Of course this is just an idea, if you do not like it, then that's okay with me, I at least wanted to try and offer to help. Also the my new design is just a mockup and I am open for any improvements! Since I am not a designer it surely could be improved ;)

The behavior does not change when I enter an invalid password.

Creating a new database using KeepassDroid works: the database is created and the interface with its contents is shown, but closing the database and then attempting to re-open it fails in exactly the same fashion as for an existing database.

----

I wonder if this has something to do with the ""runtime permissions"" stuff apparently added in 2.3.x as the Android version used on this device (4.0.3) does not support them (if I understand the idea correctly: the program asks for permissions interactively when it first needs them—as opposed to blanket-selection of them upon install/update).

I'm savvy enough to have figured this out, but other users may not be, and my be confused...

According to the Android docs here: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display#FLAG_SECURE

> An application can use the absence of this flag as a hint that it should not create secure surfaces or protected buffers on this display because the content may not be visible. For example, if the flag is not set then the application may choose not to show content on this display, show an informative error message, select an alternate content stream or adopt a different strategy for decoding content that does not rely on secure surfaces or protected buffers.

Perhaps the app should show a note to users who are not on a ""secure display"", instead of just showing a blank box?"

I use a Moto G5 Plus, which comes with a ""Moto"" app that allows me to replace the on-screen nav buttons (back, home, recent apps) with gestures. Some apps are slightly buggy and even with this option on, the on-screen nav buttons will occasionally display. It's usually not disruptive so I ignore it since it's an OEM option and not part of standard Android.

However KeePassDroid as of 2.2.2.4 now toggles the on-screen buttons on *every keystroke*. That means every time I press a keyboard button to enter my password the keyboard jumps up or down so I have to reorient before pressing the next button. It's extremely annoying and has never happened before in any other app nor in KeePassDroid prior to 2.2.2.4.

keepassdroid cant open this DB, says db is too large for the phone.
Same DB is opened by keepass2Android just fine. Though as it does not use native argon2 implementation, it is extremely slow to open, but it surely does.

The OOM details from the log is as below:

I think since a non-native implementation is able to load a 200KB DB , this is a bug and needs to be addressed. Moreover, if the DB size is less, like 20-40KB i dont face the issue.
Is 200KB size too much to ask as of today's standards?

What it does is create a key for encryption/decryption of the password field in PasswordActivity that is secured with fingerprint.

The encrypted password is stored in app preferences with a key based on the name of the database uri (path) so should be unique for each database.

Most changes are in PasswordActivity for the logic to show/hide the fingerprint icon based on support and start listening for fingerprints and handle the encoded or decoded value. 

The newly added FingerprintHelper contains the logic for handling keystore and encryption and decryption of value with a key from that secured keystore.

I'm trying to keep my pw db entirely out of the cloud, but share it between Linux laptop and phone.
Semi-working solution is to mount the Android filesystem via USB on the laptop, and copy the .kdbx into the Downloads folder.

If I use the Android file explorer, select the kdbx file, and ""send"" the file to KeepassDroid, the app opens, the DB opens (once I supply the master passphrase), and all is good.

But I don't want to fumble through the extra steps to bring up file explorer; I want to touch the KeepassDroid icon and have it remember my default database.  There's even a checkbox in KPD to ""remember this as my default database"".  So I select the checkbox, open the pw db once via the klunky procedure, exit and try again.

Problem: File not found.  The path looks OK, although I can't see the entire path because it's truncated to my screen (not a good idea for debugging, please wrap instead).  But if I return to ""open recent database"" I can see a full path.  It looks like

The current amount of 6K is barely reasonable as a minimum. I suggest changing the default value for new database creation to be 50K rounds since you want it to cause something like ~0.5s of lag in between saves/opening of the database.

I could've sworn that even back on my old blackberry I was using at least 10K rounds and I believe back then it took ~2-3s but that as pure java version and it was no where near as fast as cpus now. If I can find it in storage I'm going to pull it out and do a test with it to see how much lag there is with 50K rounds as it's a good testcase for slowest thing alive.

My galaxy nexus phone is using a database that has  #100K rounds and it seems to be almost instantaneous when decrypting my database/saving it. I also have the cpu set at 920Mhz isntead of the default 1.2ghz to increase battery life.

Also updating databases that are using a value below the new default should be updated to the new value when saving the database so that people are more protected from bruteforce attackers.

I downloaded the latest version (2.35) and imported my data into the kdbx file and moved it to my phone's storage.  The Android app could open the file, so I thought all was well. But it could/would not save the database when I tried to create a new entry.  Looks like I'm going back to the old v1 database.

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper: void addHelper(java.lang.String,android.app.backup.BackupHelper)>:[8,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

<android.app.Notification: void setLatestEventInfo(android.content.Context,java.lang.CharSequence,java.lang.CharSequence,android.app.PendingIntent)>:[1,22]

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the project’s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report."

ownCloud 2.2.0
KeePassDroid 2.0.6.4
Android 6.0.1 (Cyanogenmod 13.0-20160819-SNAPSHOT-ZNH5YAO0IN-bacon)

### Steps to reproduce
1. Place a .kbdx (KeePass 2) file on your ownCloud storage space.
2. On your Android device, set the file to be availabl offline.
3. Start KeePass Droid.
4. In Settings, enable Storage Access Framework.
5. Open the database from ownCloud.
6. Try to create a new entry.

### Expected and actual behavior
I would expect the new entry to be created. Instead, KeePassDroid crashes.

### Additional information
Opening the database from shared storage (selecting shared storage rather than ownCloud in step 5, then navigating to the ownCloud sync folder and selecting the database there) works—I can create entries. It’s just the ownCloud backend that’s having issues."

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,Mobile Integration with Security Card,[],"I'm looking for a Android Java developer interested in a project to integrate a mobile Android application with our CyberGate security card.  The card is a credit card size computer that has cpu, memory, battery, and bluetooth.   I was hoping we could leverage your Android application and have you or someone else modify to integrate with our CyberGate card.  I noticed the KeePassDroid has excellent feedback and very stable.  :)

http://www.blustor.co/

The application will have to be modified to support communication to our CyberGate card over Bluetooth classic.   This is using the SPP (Serial Port Profile).   This allows us to make FTP like calls to our CyberGate card and send/receive the KeepPass database file.

Let me know if this is a project you might be interested in discussing.

This has happened to me a number of times, most recently with dire consequences (laptop bricked due to lost BIOS password). I often do not save the new entry right away because I'm not sure if the password format meets a site's password criteria. So a very common workflow really.

The current behavior strikes me as questionable. In general, losing an unsaved form entry due to a timeout is not acceptable in any environment. On mobile, in particular, a foreground app yanking the user's current form-based activity because the user is distracted is poor behavior.

I'd think a straightforward (if temporary) fix would be to not lock the database if there is an active edit, or at least provide a setting to enable this behavior. Or auto-save the entry upon timeout instead of the far more dire yanking.

bpellin/keepassdroid,closed,Allow other apps to send password and launch_immediately through an ACTION_VIEW intent,[],"With Android's (relatively) new content URI system, passing filenames or raw URIs around between apps doesn't always work.

The solution is to grant permission in the Intent by setting a flag. But this only works if the URI is passed as the Intent's data (i.e. not an extra). This patch extends Keepass Droid's handling of Intents which contain a URI as data (ACTION_VIEW intents) to also attempt to read password and launch_immediately flags from the intent, as it does for non-ACTION_VIEW intents.

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,"allow ""panic button"" apps to lock KeePassDroid",[],"We've been developing ""panic button"" features in our apps for years, and now we are working to make a more flexible and open ecosystem of apps that can both trigger other apps, or respond to triggers. Since KeePassDroid already includes a ""lock"" feature, it is a natural panic responder app. This setup allows for easy configuration of a single trigger action which can then trigger multiple apps.

The first commit adds support for receiving the panic trigger. The second commit wipes KeePassDroid from the Recent Apps when it is responding to a panic trigger.

The first panic button app that sends this kind of trigger is called Ripple, and it is available here:
https://github.com/guardianproject/ripple
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple

I'm adding support to this app right now:
https://panicbutton.io/
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iilab.pb

This is all code that I wrote, and you can have it under any license you want, including public domain. I waive all my copyright claims to it.

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,Move keyfile into internal storage,[],"(Copied from https://code.google.com/p/keepassdroid/issues/detail?id=205 )

It would be a great feature if KeePassDroid could import a keyfile for a database into its internal storage, so that no other application could gain access to it.

Initial discussion at https://groups.google.com/group/keepassdroid-discuss/browse_thread/thread/83583ddb851702e

""One of my concerns with using KeePassDroid is that even though I use a keyfile with my database, I am concerned about a rogue application having possible access to both my keyfile and database.  Since the key file is loaded into sdcard space on the phone, any application can view it due to the permissionless FAT32 nature of the filesystem.

...

I don't mind as much that other applications can access encrypted database (which is on the system through Dropbox) as long as it requires two things that would be otherwise hard to get: my passphrase and keyfile.  Putting the keyfile into internal storage would go a long way into ensuring my data is protected.""

bpellin/keepassdroid,closed,potential improvement for responsiveness in keepassdroid,[],"Hello developers of KeePassDroid,

I'm a Ph.D. student and I'm doing research related to Android apps'
responsiveness. KeePassFroid uses ""ProgressTask"" to execute long
operations in backgroud thread to improve responsiveness. However, I
found there are still some cases that the database is accessed/queried
in UI thread. Do they affect the performance/responsiveness of the
app?

For example, in FileSelectActivity.java, the ""fileHistory.deleteFile""
is invoked at line 400 in ""onContextItemSelected"", and the DB is
eventually accessed. How about put them into AsyncTask? I attach a
sample patch here to show this. Note that after put it into AsyncTask,
there are data races on ""fileHistory"", since ""fileHistory"" is also used in
other threads at several places (e.g., line 250, line 337). Thus, the
""fileHistory.init()"" can be invoked concurrently, we could add
synchronization on it. I put line 287, 288 into AsyncTask as well.

Similarly, I also transformed PasswordActivity.java and put
""getKeyFile"" method (which access DB) into AsyncTask.

There may be some other places that can be improved. What do you think
about these improvements? My thought is we can improve the
responsiveness if we try to avoid the access to DB in UI thread.

Thanks,
Yu

2. If the current client uid == the starting client uid: access is automatically granted
3. If the uid is not the same, an access prompt will be shown. Choices are Deny, Allow and Always. 'Always' gets reset upon app changes (e.g. updates)

Clients should copy `com.keepassdroid.provider.Contract` locally to make use of the ContentProvider I have created.

I will be publishing an app that will make use of this new ContentProvider soon and would like to see KeePass have this support by then  :-)

Future changes to the ContentProvider that I might implement would be icon fetching support, for rendering entry icons in the local client.

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,Battery drain,[],"I had the battery drain issue that was reported over at Google Code. When I checked the battery use view, the top item was Android OS with what seemed like a high CPU total, but since it has never happened before and I just installed KeePassDroid today, I'm pretty sure it's the culprit.

The one thing I can think of that might be different from a default install is that I set the database lock option to ""never."" Could this mean that it keeps the file open somehow? I've changed it back, and will see if the problem reoccurs.

1) Check Settings -> Application -> Save keyfile
2) Return to main screen, and pick a keyfile
3) Enter password to unlock keepass db
4) Exit KeePassDroid
5) Restart KeePassDroid

Expected: the path to the keepass key is filled in to the last key file selected
Actual result: the keepass key path is blank

This is for:
Android 2.2.1
Atrix 4G

bpellin/keepassdroid,closed,Backup filter,[],"This change is to handle the ""Backup"" group.  On the desktop version of KeePass, KeePass can create a copy of an entry, each time you modify it.  This copy, for historical purposes, is placed in a ""Backup"" group off the root group.

Currently, KeePassDroid in a search will return all results, including the numerous historical copies in the ""Backup"" group.  The desktop version filters out any entry in the ""Backup"" group, returning only the useful current entries.  This change adds in the option, enabled by default, to filter out entries in the ""Backup"" group when doing a search.

bpellin/keepassdroid,closed,2nd try....,[],"Hi Brian!

Dumped my completely messed up Fork and started new from scratch...
Looks like also the Eclipse Git plugin had made some major improvements (or my understanding of Git has become better). So i guess i can start using it ""normally"" now, despite using Eclipse under Windows.

Found a much simpler solution for our icon problem. A bit old-fashioned, but works and doesn't eat up memory for icon ressources either.

bpellin/keepassdroid,closed,Icon handling when editing an entry...,[],"Hi Brian!

Have a look at that:
http://github.com/toluse/keepassdroid/commit/f39f9fab047c8cf309c5ba59e9599b670d83ec7f

I found out that editing an entry e.g. setting a new password resets the IconId to 0.
This tries to fix it. Not sure if i did it correctly though as i didn't get the idea when PwIcon is a custom icon and when it is a standard icon..

Bests,

bpellin/keepassdroid,closed,Initial icon support...,[],"Hi Brian...

This is the initial icon support. Only thing missing is the apple-icon. Not sure about any copyright issues yet, so that one is a blank icon.

Also not sure if i screwed up the rebase from your last 3 commits...
I used this Fork Queue thing to pull it in. Not sure if this is the propper way of doing it.
Guess you can ommit these 3 commits as i got them from your repository in the first place.

Alas have a look and let me know what you think.

Bests,

bpellin/keepassdroid,open,option to hide backup database,[],"hi,

my KeePass database has a General and a Backup group when I open it.
I'm using KeePassX at home and KeePass Portable at work with no particular modifications/options set. I don't know which program creates/updates the Backup group but it must be either of the two mentioned.
I assume that others have the ""Backup"" too.

The ability to hide it by option would be great OR even better to simply start in the General group as ""root""
