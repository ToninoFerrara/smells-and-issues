Zanshinmu/Wifi-Fixer,open,Idea: Fold in capabilities from PrivacyPolice re: multipoint security / disabling,[],"@Zanshinmu @All

https://github.com/BramBonne/privacypolice has very similar multipoint detection capabilities as Wifi-Fixer has, with a slightly different focus: it's to _prevent_ from connecting to certain repeaters for security purposes.  I propose to include this capability in Wifi Fixer for both security & performance reasons: if 1 could mark a MAC address as ""do-not-connect"" (or conversely be prompted to whitelist it, as PrivacyPolice does), it would solve a lot of public vs private wifi issues.

Here's an example: In my area, a lot of businesses choose to have public wifi via AT&T (attwifi) or Comcast/Xfinity (xfinitywifi), &, when in business, that wifi is completely open. But, when at home, my neighbors, having either AT&T or Comcast/Xfinity, have both their own (secured) SSIDs, but also the same semi-open SSIDs (attwifi or xfinitywifi), which my device now ignores because of Privacy Police, but Wifi Fixer would try to connect to automatically at home, which then fails there, after much attempting.

What do you think?

P.S.:  I helped you test initial multipoint capabilities many moons ago via a very long e-mail chain.  I'm very happy & thankful to see the feature at this level of maturity.

Zanshinmu/Wifi-Fixer,open,"Samsung Galaxy S3 LTE and UK ""Eduroam"" wifi network","[Label(name=""Accepted"")]","If you are a higher education student in the UK chances are you can use the Eduroam wifi network. This allows you to use your network ID and password for your ""home"" Uni network to connect to the Eduroam network in other places where the network exists i.e. at another Uni campus. Its a federated login, effectively.

Anyway, wifi fixer seems to throw a spanner in the works when connecting to this network and I would constantly get Authentication Errors. The device would associate, but never connect.

Uninstalling wifi fixer allowed me to connect without a problem

The network where I am uses PEAP (EAP method) and MSCHAPV2 (Phase 2 auth).

Wifi fixer didn't cause a problem with my home wifi router and worked as expected.

I can provide more details if you describe what is required.

Maybe this is related to the S3 phone itself or the Android version (4.1.1), as my previous Android phone (HTC desire HD) used wifi fixer, and quite happily connected to the Eduroam network.
