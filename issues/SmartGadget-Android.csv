I'm running the smart gadget on an Android version 5.0.2, locations and Bluetooth services enabled.
Yet I can't connect to my sensor. Bluetooth and Locations in my phone seems to be working well with other instruments and /or apps.

The sensor itself seems to be fine cause I'm logging to it from other phones. 

Can you tell me what might be the problem? Is the Android version too old? In the google playit says that it should be working with Lolipop and up.

Sensirion/SmartGadget-Android,closed,Permission <READ_PHONE_STATE> is declared but not used,[],"Hello, I'm Denis Bogdanas, a research assistant at Oregon Stat University.
I'm working on a tool that automatically introduces runtime permission checks and requests for Android 6 apps. As part of this study I analyzed this app. I was looking at the way permissions are referred in the code.

This app declares permissions <READ_PHONE_STATE> in the apk manifest, but doesn't have any code that requires them. It is possible that source code doesn't declare the permissions. I only analyzed apk builds from f-droid. Yet android build mechanism may introduce them when the app uses certain libraries:

https://commonsware.com/blog/2015/06/25/hey-where-did-these-permissions-come-from.html

It won't create any problems on Android 6, but on Android 5- users may wonder why the app needs these permissions and be skeptical of installing the app.

Do you think this is an issue?

best regards,
Denis

I am developing a tool to automatically refactor Android applications with the goal of improving energy efficiency.
This pull request has the changes generated while applying the rule ""ObsoleteLayoutParam"".

While developing your application's views you might be specifying attributes in a view's artefact that are not necessary due to the nature of its parent. In this PR, those attributes were replaced by a comment.

I have made a previous validation of the changes and they seem correct.
Unfortunately, this tool is not able keep the original whitespace of the files, so comparison without ignoring whitespace might be confusing.
Please consider the changes and let me know if you agree with them.

I have two [SHT31s](https://www.sensirion.com/products/humidity-sensors/development-kit/), and [the app v1.8.1](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.sensirion.smartgadget) on a [S4mini with CyanogenMod](https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Serranoltexx_Info) 13. The phone pairs with the SHT31s, but the app doesn't discover them under `Settings > Connections > Smart Gadgets` (screenshot from the app switcher at the bottom).

Whenever the app asks for Bluetooth permissions, I click allow. I tried in Flight mode and with all other apps closed. [BLExplorer](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.ligi.blexplorer) I sees ""Smart Humigadget"" & also connects. However, the Smart Gadget app scans without ever discovering the SHT31 :-(

What could be wrong here? What info can I provide to help the trouble-shooting? Thanks for any help with this issue :-)

Sensirion/SmartGadget-Android,open,X-axis labels in plots unevenly distributed/missing values,[],"Running with 1 min of logging interval and live connection the X-axis labels in the 10 min view change while the screen is being updated. I would expect the view to show 10 to 0 constantly, but instead it displays

- 9  7  6 ... 0
- 8  7  6 ... 0
- 9  8  6 ... 0

in some unpredictable manner with each screen update. I could understand some update when the data is also scaled, but just the axis labels seem to change.

Within the ""1 Hour"" view labels are just unevenly distributed meaning distance is equal, but values are not equally spaced: 53  46  40  33  26  20  13  6  0 Perhaps the calculated distance is 6.5 min, but this is rounded in some way.

""6 Hours"" and ""1 Day"" is going well, displaying 6 labels at the end of 6 intervals (1 hour/4 hours) and are always he same. One would expect the ""1 hour"" to be displaying 50  40  30  20  10  0 following that scheme, but strangely it is not.

The week view misses a whole day (today its Sunday, on Monday it was Friday), so always today-3 is not shown?! Additionally where ""today"" should be (right end of the screen) the display is always one day ahead (now: Thu but it is Wed - at least in my timezone ;-))"

Sensirion/SmartGadget-Android,closed,Fix aggregation of RH and T values for download,[],"This fixes a serious bug in the download feature that would lose three out of four data points, see the commit message below.

Even after fixing this bug, there are still more strange issues, I documented them here: #31.

When downloading logged RH/T values, these do not arrive in pairs,
but independently. Also, they arrive in packets, so several RH values
might arrive before the corresponding T value does. The code to
aggregate these values in pairs did not account for this, losing
three out of four values by overwriting them in the aggregator.

There are now two different aggregation strategies for live and
logged data: for live values, the timestamp is ignored, for historic
values it is not.

Also, for a logging interval of 10 minutes, the newest point is shown to be older than 10 minutes which cannot be. I assume there is an error in the timestamp calculation, so it might be a bug in libble.

When investigating the second issue, I found the documentation of the BLE protocol sorely missing. All I found is https://github.com/Sensirion/SmartGadget-Firmware/blob/master/Simple_BLE_Profile_Description.pdf . This lists the available characteristics, but does not explain their meaning and how you would use them when performing a download. Could you add more information to this? I am especially interested in the characteristics OldestTimestampMs, NewestTimestampMs and SyncTimeMs
