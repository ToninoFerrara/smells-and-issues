Is this intended behaviour?

wizmer/syncorg,closed,The number of method references in a .dex file cannot exceed 64K,[],"Hi,

the source code reached the famous problem of insufficiently big dex file and therefore it can't be build.
As I see it, there are the following possibilities:

* drop support for older Android (the oldest supported version would be 5 (API 21)
* use proGuard and hope it will shrink the code enough; that also mean update the build API from 24 to 25. It is probably just a temporary solution
* use multiindex which results in longer starting time
* clean up the code from unneeded methods

None of this is ideal. For me personally the easiest way would be just drop the support for older Android, but I believe there are still many users with Android below 21.

Maybe this question can pass  as a ""documentation issue""? Eventually people as ignorant as I am will want to use SyncOrg. Well, I guess that's already happened.

So far, in my org directory on the server on my LAN I have done

git init

git add *.org

git commit *.org

After the first sync by SyncOrg all the org files appeared on my phone. That was good!

After making changes on the phone and syncing again, though, the org files on the server did not change.

SyncOrg seems to be doing its part, though. Each time I modify and sync, I get three new subdirectories in  .git/objects. 

Using 

git cat-file -p <hash>

I do see the changes I made on the phone. So the information is making it to the server. This is also good!

So I must be missing something. A command I should issue on the server to combine the modifications in .git/objects with the main files, maybe? Hoping it's that simple. 

Thanks in advance. Alternatively sorry in advance for posting this in an inappropriate place.

I've cloned the project and verified that this error is happening on the master branch as well. Let me know how I can help get this fixed.

wizmer/syncorg,open,git-remote-gcrypt support?,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I'm very interested in using this, but I use Dropbox for syncing my Org files, so I can't use it with this yet.

I've also been thinking about using Git to sync my Org files, but the issue there is that I don't want to upload my Org files to remote, untrusted servers unencrypted.  However, I've been testing `git-remote-gcrypt`, and it seems to work well.

So, any chance of `git-remote-gcrypt` support?  It uses `gpg` for crypto, but once configured, it's all automatic.

Thanks very much for your work on bringing MobileOrg into the future!

wizmer/syncorg,open,Exclude completed entries in from agenda,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This brings up the question of how what a completed state IS is determined (Filed #4).

Emacs uses `org-todo-keywords` to determine this. I think its great that syncorg has removed mobileorgs tight coupling with emacs, but it seems like some mechanism to incorperate user specific settings is needed. Perhaps a small melpa package that can output a configuration file that is parsable by mobileorg would be a solution?
"
wizmer/syncorg,open,"Ignore archive files in agenda, or otherwise offer some mechanism to explicitly specify org-agenda files, as in emacs","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","My agenda is currently flooded with items that are in archive files in my org repo!

I'm going to take a look at trying to fix this, but I'd like your input on which approach you'd like to take.

I think that having the ability to explicitly specify which files should be part of the agenda view would be a good idea.

Actually, it might be cool to support multiple named agendas. What do you think?
