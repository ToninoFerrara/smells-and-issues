i'm making a lot of assumptions about how things work, like swapping version numbers. my most curious question is.. can i use the ""upgrade"" function to *downgrade*? also, i just threw in a whole new `miscellaneousChecks2()` function, and i'm assuming i can just do that.

i think making everything downgrade to v2.3 is a good idea. if the user has v2.4 tags and they're working, then they probably won't run this app and so they can keep their v2.4 tags. but if someone needs to *fix* their tags, then we can assume that they really want to make *sure* their tags will work, so changing all v2.4 tags to v2.3 seems like the right thing to do.

vanilla-music/vanilla-music-tag-editor,closed,Cannot write LYRICS tag on external sd-card,[],"Hello
I try to set lyrics tags to my mp3 files on my external sd.
I have a Cubot Note Plus with Android 7.0 and the tag write plugin version 1.2.6
I allowed to write on external media after installing (Android permission).
But when I push the write button I get the error:
**Nothing selected from SAF file picker, exiting**
I read the closed issue #16 but that didn't help.
First I thought it's the lyrics plugin but [there I read](https://github.com/vanilla-music/vanilla-music-lyrics-search/issues/4) its here to find, because that plugin just uses tag editor plugin.
It can write a .lrc file though, but that doesn't help me, my player (PowerAmp) cannot use it.
How can I get things working?

Thanks, Frank
