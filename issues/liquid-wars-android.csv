When we can appreciate a new version release? :)

xenris/liquid-wars-android,open,New Maps/Tweaked AI,[],"I have added a few new maps to the game and made a slight tweak to one of the AI constants (which makes its movements slightly more aggressive and thus slightly better at escaping situations).

I was not sure on how to handle the translations, however, so those will need to be updated. If it is desired, I can place the English version of the new map names in the other files.

xenris/liquid-wars-android,closed,Wi-Fi direct/Tethering,[],"Hi!
Can you be so kind to include the Wi-Fi direct support for the multiplayer?
I ask because when i try to host with my friends through a Wi-Fi direct or a Tethering connection (because I have not a Wi-Fi AP in my area) the app say that there is not a Wi-Fi connection even if the mobile itself is the AP :)

Thanks in advance!
