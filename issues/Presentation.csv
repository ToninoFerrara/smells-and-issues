feelinglucky/Presentation,open,Slow loading at least version from here,[],"It usually takes at least a minute to load a presentation and I have a good internet. Also, 1 time in 3, the presentation doesn't appear: just a grey screen. 

p.s. the feedback button says I don't have an email client, though I have k9 installed.

feelinglucky/Presentation,closed,License?,[],"I was browsing github and came across the app. Even as an English speaker it is interesting to use so I'd like to propose it for the f-droid.org repository of FOSS Android apps, but you would need to put an overall license, such as Apache or GPLv3. The TalkingData library would be removed because I guess it is proprietary. Regards.

如果使用下面代码是可以调用Gamil的：

``` Java
public static void sendMail(Context context, String to, String subject, String content) {
        Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO,Uri.fromParts(""mailto"",to, null));
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject);
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, content);
        Intent newIntent = Intent.createChooser(i, ""Send Email""); 
        newIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
        context.startActivity(newIntent);
    }
