jruesga/PhotoPhase,closed,Feature: double-tap to get image info,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi again,

Would it be possible to add a new possibility when double-taping on a photo, which is to get a popup with info on the photo (date, name, path, and possibly gps location if available, or other exif data)?

Thanks again for your time and effort on this app!

jruesga/PhotoPhase,closed,Preserve filename when resizing,[],"Hi,

I've been using your app for years, and I've only one word: thank you!

I've a very simple suggestion: when creating a resized image, could the app name it using the original image (plus a suffix, if you need uniqueness)? 

Currently, when an image is resized, the resized image displayed is always named ""VT-Compress (tm) Xing Technology [...]"", which is quite a pitty. I so loose the possibility to double-tap and open the image in order to get its name (name of the painting, date of the photo, etc.).

Would it be possible?"
