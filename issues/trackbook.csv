y20k/trackbook,open,Android Wear Support,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","This one came in via email. Trackbook could be extended to work on **Android Wear**. Android Wear Support could come in two steps.

1. **Control Trackbook via watch**
There at least three options should be accessible via Wear. ""Start Recording"", ""Stop and Save"", (just) ""Stop"".

2. **Make Trackbook run standalone on GPS watches**
The TrackerService and LocationHelper must be ported to Wear.

Anyway. At the moment I do not have the time (and the hardware) for it. But I think it would be a nice addition to Trackbook. Maybe a project for an **external contributor(*)** or a project for me, as soon as I have worked out the rough edges on the main app.

y20k/trackbook,closed,More intutive access to statistics,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",I found it a bit hard and counter-intuitive to access the statistics of a recorded track.

I have been using the app for a while now without too many issues, and asking a few friends to use it too!
When me and my friend compare our walking routines, I noticed that my friend has the distance recorded in feet (needless to say they are from the U.S) where as I have it in metres. How does the app determine what units to use? They were trying to switch to a more sane system ðŸ˜‰, but seems like there is no option to do so.
So the obvious request is, would it be possible to add it to the app? Perhaps add an 'Options' in the menu thing. If in the future you end up adding more features, they can go in there. For the time being, if you can add the option to switch between systems, it will be great!

When you are certain that things are more or less stable, you can move the sources to the master branch and release the final version there. "
y20k/trackbook,closed,Idea for displaying multiple recorded files,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Now that displaying last recorded track is more or less fully functional, we can perhaps proceed to implementing full fledged history display. 
I remember somewhere you said you were first going to display a few files at a time. I was thinking about it yesterday, I think there is a simpler way to do an arbitrary number of files. We know that all files are stored under Android/data/org.y20k.trackbook/*.trackbook. Why not pull up a list of files, put them in a variable and load the current file to display? 
As an example, on a shell I know I would type `ls /Android/data/org.y20k.trackbook/*.trackbook` and this will give the list of files that can be read by trackbook. You can pull this list (use `trim()` if necessary) and cycle through the list when the user wants to go to the previous or next track. The list *may* have to be updated everytime the 'History' tab is opened. 
as an example, I know doing this is pretty simple on something like Python, you call the function to get the list of files, store the results in a list, and allocate a variable to keep the current index(can always start at 0) and just `load(file_list([ind]))`. Everytime user presses back or forward, increment/decrement index as required and load() again. You can wrap around/disable the buttons if `ind<0 or ind>len(file_list)`. This does not really require you do manually keep a track of EVERY track ever recorded, because the list is generated dynamically. Due to generating list of files dynamically, this method can also avoid circumstances where user moves new tracks in/moves old tracks out for backup purposes. 
However I *could* vastly be underestimating the requirements for Android, if that is the case do let me know! 
As for how to provide an interface to actually allow the said cycling, to keep things simple, you could just put two buttons on the top or bottom (like `<<` `>>` or `Prev Track` `Next Track`) that will allow users to move forward or backward. Edit: Alternatively, you could show a dropdown list of the all files where the user can tap any file they want and load that file. 
Of course, all this at your own time ðŸ˜„ . As usual, do not hesitate to release beta apks for me to break and annoy you with ðŸ˜†

Conceptually it appears simple. When the user taps a point, a bubble (similar to the 'Locate me' info bubble which tells you GPS/Network thing) shows up showing the date (and possibly GPS coordinates) of that particular point. In particularly long recording sessions (like the ones I have sometimes), it will be nice to know what time you got to a particular place from a particular place. 
Looking at the json files, the time appears to be saved anyway. So you can pull that info out of the temp file/recorded file and display it on the bubble."

This issue is present most of the time. To reporduce the issue, just start tracking as usual, let the app do its thing in the background. Now sometime after, open the app to see your route. 

There are no points displayed on the map! HOWEVER, the notification is fine and is updated as usual. Also, once you STOP tracking, the points are visible on the map. You can then proceed to save them without issue.
