lllllT/AtmosphereLogger,open,Recording stops randomnly,[],"Hello

Android 4.0.4
The barometer reading recording stops randomly. I haven't be able to pinpoint the succession of events that triggers the interruption. I believe that the recording is active as long as the application is in the background, and stops when the Android system clears the application from the background ? Could the solution be to have the application working as a service?

lllllT/AtmosphereLogger,open,Android automatic refactor - Recycle,[],"Hi,

I am developing a tool to automatically refactor Android applications with the goal of improving energy efficiency.
This pull request has the changes generated while applying the rule ""Recycle"".

Some resources (e.g., ```Cursor``` instances) should be closed when they are no longer necessary.

I have made a previous validation of the changes and they seem correct.
Please consider them and let me know if you agree with them.

Best,
