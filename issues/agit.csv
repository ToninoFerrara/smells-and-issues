Thing is, having agit installed makes my system ask me, every time I browse a github url (and many others I suppose) in chrome, whether I want to open it in agit or chrome. Clicking chrome and Always does not persist, and soon I get that question again. Generally, answering Always on my system does work, just not for this.

If agit first did a checkout it would recover from any mutilations I've done to the files. Since it's currently a read-only client, mutilations should not be expected to survive.

rtyley/agit,open,agit only stores host keys while session is active,[],"The following code, at the beginning of `CuriousHostKeyRepository`, initializes the `knownKeys` hashmap for the application:

```
    Map<String, byte[]> knownKeys = newHashMap();
```

Unfortunately, as soon as the application closes, this `knownKeys` hashmap is removed. This forces the user to accept a prompt for a host key that is deemed ""curious"" the next time the app is run. This degrades sync on these repos, because it requires the user to accept the host key if agit wasn't previously running (thus it can't happen in the background).

My suggestion would be (as a naive implementation) to store accepted host keys in the preference store. The down side to this, though, is that when a repository is removed, the associated keys should also be removed from the preference store for the host on which the repo was located (unless there exists another repo with the same host).
"
rtyley/agit,closed,Crash @ com.android.internal.view.menu when refreshing a repository,[],"Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone a personal repository (for me, this meant a repository on a private server that has a self-signed SSL certficate... I'm not sure if this actually has anything to do with the crash). The initial clone worked fine.
2. Click the refresh button at the top of the nav bar.

Expected Results:
In this case, I'd expect nothing to happen, because the repository was just cloned, and no pushes have been made to it since the clone.

Actual Result:
Agit crashes due to a NullPointerException.

rtyley/agit,open,Add ConnectBot as a library to agit,[],"In the wiki, it mentions that ConnectBot can be used to store keys for git over SSH. Unfortunately, this requires that ConnectBot be installed prior to agit. I suspect there is rationale for not including an implementation of ConnectBot with agit, but it would be nice if a bare bones implementation were included so users can skip this step.

~~Alternatively, if agit didn't detect a usable SSH client on first run, it would be nice if it remembered this and researched for it on subsequent runs. Or, even pointed to the Google play page for ConnectBot. This would save users from having to the uninstall agit-install ConnectBot-reinstall agit dance.~~

This works, but it's sort of a first pass at fixing this problem. Ideally, I think it would be nice to be able to sync with different options (e.g. every X minutes/hours, once per week, once a day, X day of the month, etc..). This is possible right now, but it requires that the user calculate the sync frequency to minutes, which is rather tedious for longer-term syncs.

rtyley/agit,closed,experiment with android:largeHeap=true in manifest,[],"According to http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html this _may_ help with memory pressure:

android:largeHeap
Whether your application's processes should be created with a large Dalvik heap. This applies to all processes created for the application. It only applies to the first application loaded into a process; if you're using a shared user ID to allow multiple applications to use a process, they all must use this option consistently or they will have unpredictable results.
Most apps should not need this and should instead focus on reducing their overall memory usage for improved performance. Enabling this also does not guarantee a fixed increase in available memory, because some devices are constrained by their total available memory.

To query the available memory size at runtime, use the methods getMemoryClass() or getLargeMemoryClass().

I have a repository I consistently fail to clone on most of my devices (only works on the N4). I know I shouldn't have large files in it, but it's just very convenient ;-) Would be awesome if you could give largeHeap a try to see if it improves things.

thank you,

rtyley/agit,closed,HTTP authentication: in-url credentials are ignored,[],"Agit currently doesn't handle http connections requiring authentication - even if the credentials are entered into the clone url, ie:

```

The clone will fail, not prompt for credentials, and wont use the credentials stored in the url - that last bit of behaviour might be a regression associated with updates from the JGit library, because I'm fairly sure that used to work...

rtyley/agit,open,HTTP redirects are ignored during git-fetch over HTTP,[],"Arnt Gulbrandsen reports that Agit fails to follow HTTP redirect codes when cloning - ie when a repo has moved. Points noted:
-   doesn't clone or pull from the new location.
-   doesn't ask whether the location might be wrong, or suggest pulling from the 301-specified location instead
-   doesn't allow manually specifying a new pull location

Arnt supplied a sample repo which redirects: http://git.aox.org/aox.git â†’ https://github.com/aox/aox.git

A quick test with CGit shows that it succeeds in cloning the example from the original git.aox.org source url - so it's probably hitting paths on the old url space and getting redirected for every hit that forms part of the 'fetch' operation. The git config file still shows a fetch url of http://git.aox.org/aox.git after the clone is complete.

Patching JGIt to get it's http client to follow redirects like CGit is an option... we should obviously allow the user to edit the urls for the remotes as well.

rtyley/agit,open,Added Polish translation,[],"Hi!

As a big fan of Git I found your app for Android and gave it a try :)

I also prepared the basic translations to Polish in `strings.xml`. Though I couldn't find lots of phrases there, like:
_protocol:
fetch complete
fetch failed
fetching
fetched
clone cancelled
clone completed
password required 
please enter your password
deleting repo 
branches
tags_

If you could make them ""translatable"" I would further expand `strings.xml` file.

On the other hand I'm not sure where these keys appear in the app?
_suggest_repos_button
checkout_commit_menu_option
pull_to_refresh_pull_label
tag_message_label
tag_message_label
suggest_repos_button_

I think that `CREDITS.markdown` and `Using-SSH.markdown` also deserve translation. But am not sure how to name them (maybe `CREDITS.pl.markdown`) or alternatively where to put them?

The translation was not yet tested on the device - as I don't know how to compile the source... If you could send me a compiled .apk file based on this branch? And please don't merge it yet as probably there would be some fine-tuning needed.

The dashboard and big Clone button is great, but users are _still_ getting confused and incorrectly assessing that Agit does not support SSH. A subtle 'SSH' in the middle of the big blank area would probably go a long way to helping clear this up, linking to the SSH install guide.

rtyley/agit,open,Eclipse Build,[],"Several changes are required in order to build within Eclipse, I'd suggest the first two should be fixed in the repository.

parent-agit pom:
Some maven dependencies/goals (default-jar) are better handled within Eclipse using version 3.0.0 of the maven-android-plugin, I used version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.

The m2e-android connector also requires this (this should also be installed in Eclipse, via the connector selection dialog invoked from the pom page or via the catalog button in the preferences dialog)
http://rgladwell.github.com/m2e-android

agit pom:
in the agit pom - the relative directory path below causes an NPE in eclipse-m2e, possibly this could be resolved by specifying the path in a different manner or moving the involved files.

```
<!--  this causes a NPE in eclipse-m2e, it doesn't like ${basedir}/.. - in particular the '..' 
            <resource>
                <directory>${basedir}/..</directory>
                <targetPath>assets/</targetPath>

            </resource>
-->
```

Proguard seems to get run regardless of the profile in-use - I haven't really understood this problem yet, possibly it's something to do with building the a module individually, or possibly something to do with using Eclipse.  Will update with further comment when I understand what's going on.

Any other lifecycle-mapping errors can be resolved through the GUI - either installing missing m2e-connectors or ignoring (initially).  The GUI provides quick-fixes for resolving / ignoring / executing unhandled plugins - e.g. Proguard.  These have to be considered on a case by case basis.  I disabled Proguard from the AGit pom error (where it manifests) but set it disabled in the parent pom - it can probably be safely enabled (which needs to be explicitly through the newly created lifecycle mapping by manually changing the ignore tag).

The default ignore entry looks like this currently (it's version dependent):

rtyley/agit,open,Clone fails for Postgresql,[],"For
git://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git

When performing a Clone in AGit either from the Device (HTC Desire) or in the Emulator it fails.

Two different errors are reported (but possibly the same cause) - the device raises an IOException in jgit (I don't have a stack trace for this - determined by inspection):

org.eclipse.jgit.transport.PacketLineIn.java
readLength() throws this exception:

<pre><code>throw new IOException(MessageFormat.format(JGitText.get().invalidPacketLineHeader,
                    """" + (char) lineBuffer[0] + (char) lineBuffer[1]
                    + (char) lineBuffer[2] + (char) lineBuffer[3]));
</code></pre>


And
In the Emulator I get a OutOfMemoryError Exception.

<pre><code>Out of memory on a 2323-byte allocation.

Given the size of Postgresql - maybe it's all related to this?

rtyley/agit,open,Add full-file code browser - ie commit-tree viewer,[],"Agit currently gives commit-diffs as the only way to view file contents. A commit-tree viewer than lets you see all files in their state at that precise commit, view each file - and filter easily by name - would be great.

from Joel:

```
What I am missing is a real code browser. You can only take a look to the part
of files which got changed in a selected commit, but sometimes, when I'm in a
train for example, I'd really like to browse ALL the files from the repo in their
current state completley.
```

A workaround for the time being is to do a non-bare checkout and view the checked out files using a file-browser app- see
