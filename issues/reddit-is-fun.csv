talklittle/reddit-is-fun,open,replace AsyncTask with AsyncTaskLoader,[],"Hello, I'm doing research on Android async programming. Some articles (for example [this article](http://bon-app-etit.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-dark-side-of-asynctask.html)) mention that AsyncTask leads to memory leak and losing task result when there's a configuration change (such as orientation change). Android docs recommend [AsyncTaskLoader](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/AsyncTaskLoader.html) (require API level 11), which avoid the problems in AsyncTask.

I try to replace one AsyncTask with AsyncTaskLoader in `reddit-is-fun` in this pr (you don't have to merge). Do you think AsyncTaskLoader will work better for `reddit-is-fun`? Do you want to replace all AsyncTask to AsyncTaskLoader?

talklittle/reddit-is-fun,closed,"Thumbnail cache never clears, causing system slowdown",[],"I'm not sure if it's by design or bug, but the downloaded thumbnails are never erased during normal use - neither clearing the app cache in the system settings nor clearing the history in the in-app settings will erase them. Only fully erasing the app's data or deleting them manually gets rid of them.

Though the files are tiny, the sheer number of them after several days of use causes my system to grind to a halt when performing drive space calculations (like in Settings > Apps or Settings > Storage). When I first figured out what was causing it and went to delete the thumbnails, there were so many that my file manager would freeze before it could open the folder.

I've now set up a Tasker task that clears out the folder once a day, solving the problem for me. But it ought to do that automatically in the app, or at least provide an on-demand method for emptying the folder.

This bug is reproducible:

1) Post a self-text or comment that contains an ampersand or a less-than or greater-than character.
2) Select to edit the post/comment.
3) Do not change any of the text.  You will see escaped HTML such as `&amp;`
4) Submit the unaltered text and you'll see it posted the escaped HTML which must be escaped again.  You end up with posts that contain `&amp&amp&amp&amp;` after a few edits.

talklittle/reddit-is-fun,open,Tapping on selected story/comment isn't consistent,[],"Using 2.0.1:

Tapping a story selects it, highlighting it and adding action **links** underneath it. Tapping a selected story toggles the display of those action links, while keeping it selected. There is no apparent meaning to a story being selected but not having action links

Tapping a comment selects is, highlighting it and adding action **buttons** above and below the comment. Tapping a selected comment does nothing, while tapping the ""cancel"" button de-selects it but does not eg. cancel votes just cast for the comment.

The above behaviours aren't very intuitive and should be consistent both internally and with each other. I'd propose the following: Tapping a story or comment should highlight it and add action links to it. Tapping a selected story or comment should deselect it, removing the highlight and hiding the action links. Tapping the back button should also deselect any story or comment before moving to the previous view.

talklittle/reddit-is-fun,closed,Go to comment broken,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""fixed"")]","Finally figured out why. It's because of the load-on-demand feature for the comments. When jumping to comment, the list item sizes are reported as 0 or something very small. Only after loading the comment do they report the correct size.

I can think of two solutions right now:
1. load comments one at a time in order, not in getView(). jumpToComment() piggybacks, or at least waits until the desired comment has been loaded by that thread, before jumping to it.
2. jumpToComment() fires repeatedly every 100-200ms until scrolling stops. Disadvantages are different load speed on different devices, and possibly user trying to scroll simultaneously.

talklittle/reddit-is-fun,open,Add option to resize direct imgur links,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","This might fall slightly out of the scope of what reddit-is-fun is trying to accomplish, but would be immensely helpful, especially when not on wi-fi (in slow spots).  Since such a large number of posts to reddit are direct links to imgur images, I think it would be nice to have the option to automatically use imgur's image resizing features in the links (e.g. use the 'large' size of all images).  

It's easy to do with a little regex, simply put a lowercase L (l) at the end of the imgur link before the file extension.  This will scale down large images that eat up lots of bandwidth on 3g and allow them to load much faster.  Here's how to do it.

Regular image: http://i.imgur.com/XXXXX.png (big image)

I used Taskiller to verify that the process is no longer running after I open the browser, but before I hit the back button.

This started happening a week or two ago. I'm not sure if it happened after an upgrade of the app.

I'm running Cyanogenmod 4.2.9.1
I have very few other processes running, and 28MB of RAM free before running Reddit is Fun.
I have a G1.

I did some more testing. After a reboot the app worked fine. But then the problem came back again later in the day. I'm running Reddit is Fun (RIF), and then I open Taskiller from the persistent notification. I only ran Taskiller, and via the notification, because I wanted to launch another processes without having to go back to the home screen, or click anything in RIF. Just so I could see what happened in this case. RIF is crashing as soon as another activity begins. Apparently from an ""Activity pause timeout"". I took a look at the Android log and this is what I found.

talklittle/reddit-is-fun,closed,Broken markdown lists. Comments cut off.,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""fixed"")]","Hello,

I really enjoy this application, but I noticed an error with the way some posts are rendered.

Check out this post:

http://reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/a7wmz/heres_a_picture_of_me_in_my_studio_anyone_else/

When viewed from within 'reddit is fun', many posts with links are truncated in strange places -- notably, one by user locutor and one by user robhutten.

I've only just now noticed this phenomenon, but I can recall many other instances where people had links in their posts and referred to something like ""the third link"", which only confused me.

Any thoughts? Thanks for writing this app, by the way -- it's a real lifesaver. The m.reddit.com site was my previous way to check reddit on the go.

talklittle/reddit-is-fun,closed,Browser CPU usage,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""fixed"")]","""""""Hello I've been using your app on my htc magic for a while and have recently upgraded to android 1.6. Since then I have been having problems with increased battery consumption which according to my the battery use monitor is caused by the browser app. The strange thing is that it can occur even when the browser isn't active. I have investigated the problem and discovered that it is connected to 'Reddit is fun'. I can reproduce it by first starting the browser app, starting RIF, opening a link in RIF which opens in a new browser window, then closing the link with the Back key. This causes the browser app running in the background to use a steady 10 - 15% of the CPU which really sucks the juice out of my battery. It only occurs when the browser is already running in the background prior to opening the link in RIF. I am running the custom donut rom from Amon-RA and this could well be the source of the bug. If you should have a chance to try it out on another donut build, I would be most grateful to hear the result.""""""

Things to consider:
- You can grab at most 200 comments in one go. To load more comments you need to branch off of the ""more"" info in the JSON file.
- The user needs to have an estimate of how much space the downloaded content will take, both for SD card capacity checking and for pay-per-bandwidth cell plans.
