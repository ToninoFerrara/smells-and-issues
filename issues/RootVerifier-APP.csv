abcdjdj/RootVerifier-APP,closed,RootVerifier doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy S2 CM11-Nightly-20150316,[],"Hi, I just tried your app (F-Droid version) and I found that it doesn't work on my device.
I have a Galaxy S2 (old but gold) I9100, with CyanogenMod 11 official nightly (16/03/2015).

I've found that, in your app, you check for root grants by remounting /system partition and writing a dummy file on it, then checking if the file exists.

Besides the fact that this approach can be platform variant and thus not as easy as it seems to test, I would recommend you a patch (that seems to work in my own case) with a slightly different set of commands documented to work in this post ""http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/62671/mount-permission-denied-when-mounting-system-directory-on-android-device"".

Thanks for your work.
