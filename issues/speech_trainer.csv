wrr/speech_trainer,open,Signal-to-noise ratio too small to trigger recording,[],"On at least a One Plus 5T with updated Android 8.0.0 and Oxygen 5.0.4 with F-Droid app store for this app, the signal-to-noise ratio is probably too small to trigger recording and playback.

Perhaps reducing the microphone gain with 50% will solve this issue. If it is too device specific, please build in an automated procedure to calibrate for this or give the user control to have control over this because at the moment the app is no longer working. If I can help to help solve this issue by providing more details, please let me know."
wrr/speech_trainer,open,Probable Memory Leak,[],"After a double rotation of the TrainingActivity there are in heap memory 306 instances more of:

class mixedbit.speechtrainer.model.AudioEventCollector$AudioBufferInfoImpl @ 0x1339e4c0

It should not be like this because the rotations return to the same GUI state and the memory should stay in the same state as well. It could be a symptom of a bad management of the onCreate-onDestroy lifecycle. 

I have encountered this problem on an Android emulator running 7.1.1 os version. "

wrr/speech_trainer,closed,Spanish translation update and new files,[],"Hello, I have fixed a small typo in the Spanish translation for Speech Trainer.
In addition to this, I have added two html files in assets with the Spanish translations for help.html and about.html
The Free Software Foundation recommends not to translate the GPL license so I think the Spanish localization is finished for this version.

wrr/speech_trainer,closed,Add Spanish translation (attached file),[],"Hello 
I recently discovered Speech Trainer, congratulations for the work. 
I have made the Spanish translation, below you can find the content of the strings.xml file, to put in /res/values-es/ 
Sorry but I don't know how to send it as an attachment, git patch or other. 
I have added a copyright line blaming me for any mistake. 
Feel free to contact me for any issue, copyright assignment (if needed) or updates to be done. 

Regards LArjona

Note: Not sure if you prefer the name of the application to be translated to Spanish too. I left it ""as is"". If you prefer to be translated, it should be ""Entrenamiento de discurso"".
