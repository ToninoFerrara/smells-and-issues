anthonydahanne/ReGalAndroid,open,ReGalAndroid chooses wrong certificate,[],"Hi,

I have just downloaded ReGalDroid 1.2.0 from the Play Store today.

When I want to setup my gallery I get the following error:
A problem occured while connecting.
Details:
fr.mael.jiwigo.transverse.exception.JiwigoException:
javax.net.ssl.SSLException:
hostname in certificate didn't match:
<media.kosebamse.com> != <www.cloud.kosebamse.com> or <www.cloud.kosebamse.com> or <cloud.kosebamse.com>

Gallery is Piwigo 2.8.2, the Webserver Apache 2.4.7. media.kosebamse.com and cloud.kosebamse.com are virtual hosts. The cloud domain got an certificate from GlobalSign and the gallery uses an certificate from LetsEncrypt. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to HTTPS.

Could you please fix the issue and make ReGalAndroid choose the correct certificate?

Thank you in advance.

Cheers
Mirco

I've now excluded from git the .iml files that keep changing and just add noise to the project.

1 - Thumbnails were not displayed in ReGalAndroid with Piwigo > 2.4.
The thumbnail path is now in a new Xml node called ""derivatives"" with all the different images sizes.
This commit gets the url for the size called ""thumb"" if the previous method returned no url.

2 - Display album thumbnails for Piwigo galleries

This doesn't work on the S7:
http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5/587616-miss-menu-button.html#post4715333
I guess that this explains some of the issue people have reported, e.g. not being able to configure the gallery details. Holding the ""back"" button will eventually bring up the gallery configuration.

The application need to provide an accessible menu for these phones.

We could reproduce that this test works fine with some JDK/OS combinations and fails with others. It seems like differences in handling the sort order of ArrayList causes this problem. To stabilise this test I'll create a patch (for the test, not for the production code) which I'll commit (to my fork with an additional pull request) later today or tomorrow.
