iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Usage of deprecated CookieSyncManager,[],"Hi,

I have found that CookieSyncManager is still in use in WebviewFragment and OpenIDActivity. According to the [doc](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieSyncManager.html), it is deprecated since Lollipop so it may not guarantee to work.

A better implementation may be to use CookieSyncManager on lower API levels and use APIs of CookieManager to manage the cookies. I found a reference post in stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30502411/cookiesyncmanager-is-now-deprecated-what-can-i-use-instead)

Thx."

Consider the simplistic test code I have provided for you. You can remove these errors by throwing your code in a try catch block.
```java
public class TestLatLon {

        final String TEST_STR1 = ""breakyou"";
        final String TEST_STR2 = ""1"";
        //NumberFormatException
        LatLon testObj = new LatLon(TEST_STR1);
        //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        LatLon testObj2 = new LatLon(TEST_STR2);
	}

1. Add a new step to a guide
2. Choose to add an image via Media Manager
3. Choose to upload an image in the Med. Man.
4. See the app either crash or work abnormally
5. See the messages below in `adb logcat`
6. Try adding an additional image (click an empty photo slot)
7. See it seem to work ok
8. Try saving
9. See Validation Error message (Validation failed. Invalid value for images.)
10. Exiting the guide and reopening it brings you back to the state before trying to do the previous steps
11. Go back and try to add the image with problems from before (should still be in the MM). 
12. See successful add

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Fix SAML login error,[],"SAML login for most customers was broken.

The WebView logic that checks for the session cookies returned by the Clients
login form was tricked into thinking that it was on the dozuki domain, when
really it was still on the SAML login page. This is because we use a ""Black
List"" when deciding if we shouldn't capture and return the cookies. That black
list was capturing some false positives due to query params in SAML urls that
include the dozuki hostname.

The solution was to make the regex/string-comparison stricter to only look at
the first part of the domain, rather than anywhere in the URL string."
iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,QA: Test the new Marshmallow build,[],What are we finding? Let's catalog our issues here.
iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Modernize Dependencies - Material Design + AppCompat,"[Label(name=""in progress"")]","## Overview
The changes in this pull are pretty massive, so warning about that, but the changes are so sweeping because it involved removing dependencies on old (5+ years) design back-compat libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, MenuDrawer and HttpRequest which were designed to bring modern UX back to old version of android.

The android ecosystem in the last 3 years has grown tremendously to support back-compat with the AppCompat and Android Design libraries, so I wanted to drag our app into the modern day of android development and rip out those old libraries and replace them with that new-new.

## Summary of changes
- Drop support for pre-4.0 android versions (minSdk 14)
- Target and compile against the latest android sdk (compileSdk and targetSdk 25)
- Update Picasso to 2.5.2
- Update gradle-android to 2.3, Android Dev tools to 25.2.0 and Android Support to 25.0.2
- Removed ABS, replace with AppCompatActivity and Toolbar
- Removed MenuDrawer, replaced with DrawerLayout and NavigationDrawer
- Removed HttpRequest and updated OkHttp to OkHttp3 (v3.6.0)
   - Use new Cache feature in OkHttp3 to replace the Offline Guides cache so that normal browsing of the app will add to the elements and requests that are available offline.  
   - **This still has some bugs. Needs work before release**
- Removed our confusing and terrible (my bad) theming system and replaced with the new `attr/colorPrimary` and other android Design Library color constants. This was magical because it resulted in removing hundreds of drawables.
- Cleaned up color constants, now conforms to the iFixit Style Guide
- Remove old card drawable layout, use new CardView
- Replace all icon png drawables with vector drawables
- Reworked the TopicViewActivity to use the new coordinator layouts and have a nice Full image with a collapsing toolbar to show off the category images
- Use the new Toolbar libraries instead of older, holo ViewPager styles.
- Lots of general design and code updates

## Bugfixes
- Fix attaching images from phone galleries to the media manager on newer phones.
- Fix loading styles to look decent
- Fix GuideViewIntroFragment youtube videos click event to only trigger on actual clicking instead of touchdown.

## To-do
- [ ] Fix some edge cases with ApiSyncAdapter and cancelling / resyncing
- [ ] Add #'s to ApiSyncAdapter messaging to give a better status update when syncing large amounts of data
- [ ] Convert the following lists to RecyclerView and the new CardView styles for items
    - [x] Search Results
    - [ ] Guide Create Step Items
    - [ ] Guide Create Reorder Step Items
    - [ ] Comments
- [x] Test and fix bugs on Tablet views
- [ ] Test and fix bugs on older phones, v4.0.3-v4.4 (ICS)
- [x] Test and fix bugs with dozuki app
- [ ] Test and fix bugs with dozuki custom apps
    - [x] Accustream
    - [x] PVA
    - [ ] zealoptics
    - [x] dripassist
    - [ ] oscaro
- [x] Remove Magnolia Medical

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Image Upload: Use correct mime type,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","This app uploads files with the wrong `content-type`.

It's sets the type to `www-form-urlencoded`. Apache will try to parse (as form data) the first 'post_max_size' bytes of these POST requests. This process is not needed (we just read the whole POST body anyway) and it's grossly inefficient (RAM usage of 4.5 \* upload size).

We've fixed this on the server side but it would be nice to not rely on that forever.

I believe the mime type should be `application/octet-stream`.

required for Google Play Services which provides the Google Login
functionality. Android 2.2 only makes up 0.65% of installs currently. It's
unfortunate to lose them but the old app will still work for them.

- Check Google login on a few places that require it:
  - Media manager
  - Favorite guides
  - Favoriting a guide
  - etc.
- Test on various devices:

- Test in both orientations:

  - Decline permissions

At any rate, this code is more consistent with the other WebView we use
for displaying Answers and no longer exhibits any of the aforementioned
problems.

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Dozuki: Fix QR Code Scanner dependency,"[Label(name=""r-Dozuki"")]","Just a simple copypasta error that resulted in Dozuki without the ZXing
library which renders the QR code scanner feature useless.
"
iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Always ensure guide exists before saving step,"[Label(name=""r-All"")]","1. Create New Guide
2. Enter some step content
3. Hit the plus to create a new step.
4. Hit ""Yes"" to save the current step.
5. Crash.

Now we always ensure that the guide exists before trying to save a step
and everything works itself out.

Adding this _should_ fix it:

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Rename MainApplication to App,"[Label(name=""r-All"")]","It makes sense to have a short name because it's used in so many places.

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,open,Crash when trying to edit a step on private guide,"[Label(name=""low priority"")]","1. View a guide with private prerequisite guides.
2. Hit edit on a step of the private prerequisite guide.
3. Click `OK` on the `Insufficient privileges` dialog.
4. The user is left viewing step edit but nothing is displayed.
5. Hit Back.
6. Stacktrace!

We should be smarter about what the `403` dialog does. The user shouldn't be left on that page to begin with but the Activity should guard against a null `Guide` too.

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Offline Guides!,[],"This adds functionality to store guides and view them offline. See #182.
## TODO
- [x] ~~Translate new strings.~~
- [x] Make notification icons for white labelled apps
- [x] ~~Wi-Fi only sync setting?~~
- [x] Polish UI (especially for tablets)
  - Sync bar text spacing/sizing
  - Offline guide list item spacing/sizing
  - Favorites list empty state
- [x] Tie offline guides to user's favorites?
- [x] ~~Allow arbitrary offline guides outside of favorites?~~
- [x] ~~Have separate offline guides and favorites views?~~ c5437b4022503163a90c649c790e2b558059ebd8
- [x] Decide on sync frequency and events that trigger it (opening app, offline guides?) a7c9c83d6429bc437a5d327d6a4d6a179554fbab
- [x] Disable sync button if internet is unavailable. a7c9c83d6429bc437a5d327d6a4d6a179554fbab
- [x] Update notification text 8ec688fe884339c14155da8e8fd076bd6b28e900
- [x] Update notification icon 024c8937fbce5206313727ce79cc5764a21bdc2b
- [x] Fix notification display/hide conditions
- [x] The notification isn't opening the OfflineGuides activity anymore.
- [x] ~~Update Offline Guides menu drawer icon~~ (fixed by replacing FavoritesActivity with OfflineGuidesActivity)
- [x] Make a nicer interface for displaying offline Images (conditionally doing `new File(getOfflinePath(url))` is ugly) b1e71e8c16187c5c037f9270d29bc4b3464ec8e6
- [x] Improve guide progress UI updates. Right now `ApiDatabase` sends out a broadcast indicating that some data has changed and `OfflineGuidesActivity` refetches everything from the DB and reparses all of the JSON. This should be more efficient because it should really only update the progress and not refetch all of the data. It should also be able to send updates to other views that display guides e.g. guides in search, topics, favorites, teardowns, etc. 0ed570d553ad2113ea457c1c592db89cdde517ac
- [x] Make sure the UI removes offline guides that have been deleted. ee46abefa1ce284141a81af911bda911d4f077a3
- [x] Make offline guides list status display look much better and display more (useful) information.
- [x] Offline guides list last sync time should update if it's a relative time e.g. it shouldn't stay ""3 minutes ago"" for hours. Changing it to a date might work but isn't as useful because you'd always have to convert to the current time. 771519dc927a13d1d74e5b0b5474343a46471054
- [x] Update offline guides list ""Refresh"" button text. b170d20d459ad6e9be6676dddea56ccb03451df8
- [x] Change the color of the pinned icon based on the current sync status. 28cab146c8c537b263f778e873cbd1ff0f582f72
- [x] Removing favorited guide doesn't result in a UI update. 77fcbb67bf0d92ed609485d1c2f18b3bd97b96a8
- [x] Disable guide view menu items for offline guides because they won't work. f8f15b9f3b13ef367a716d873be5489dd3473cf9
- [x] Refresh offline guides when restarting activity. 1df70b53dbb92b71f6610c64f9d2defcad2057a0
- [x] ~~Delete media that is no longer referenced (this will be tricky if there are multiple users signing into a site on a single device. We don't want to delete images that might be used again if the user is logged in.)~~ Started on it but turned out to be too troublesome: 0df79be3dcb960d613b9096edd1ff060ce4fa0f5
- [x] Make sure that the app works without internet (it might be hard/impossible to view the offline guides list without internet so lets triple check that it's always possible because it would be really bad if it didn't work)
- [x] ~~`<feature creep>`Allow users to specify guide download priority.`</feature creep>`~~
- [x] Logging in causes some hanging sync stuff...
- [x] ~~Display sync errors in the offline guides list.~~

- Make ""Enter"" on the keyboard move to the next line or create a new line if one doesn't exist already. We already block newlines from being entered so it would probably be fairly easy.
- Move the ""New line"" button to the bottom bar next to ""Save"" so it will never be hidden. We will have to disable/hide it when it shouldn't be available but we already do that in the current UI.
- Scroll the pane to an appropriate place. This one will probably be difficult to get right because the ""New line"" button should be displayed if the current line being edited is the last one but we shouldn't forcibly scroll to the bottom if the first of five lines is being edited.

The whole goal is to remove the necessary manual scroll down to hit the ""New line"" button for every new line that needs to be created.

"
iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Guide Offline Browsing Working Draft,"[Label(name=""feature request""), Label(name=""r-All"")]","## User Experience

The app should be mostly usable without internet -- content that has been viewed previously should still be accessible. Signing in to the app should trigger the eventual downloading of favorited guides. The guides will be kept up to date without any user action. Favoriting a guide will perform the favorite API call and then trigger a sync.
## Technologies
1. [Sync Adapter](http://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters/creating-sync-adapter.html) for downloading data in the background. This works on demand and periodically in the background. Note: This requires use of the [AccountManager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html), [Content Provider](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html), and [Service](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html) APIs.
2. [SQLiteDatabase](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html) for storing JSON data.
3. [Internal storage](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal) for saving images to disk.
## Implementation
1. Every `GET` request response will be stored in the database keyed off of the URL and userid. If there isn't an internet connection, the stored response can be used in place of a live response.
2. Synced favorites will be stored in a separate table including `siteid`, `userid`, `guideid`, `response_body`, `modified_date`, and `status` (`COMPLETE`, `IN_PROGRESS`). Syncing will involve comparing the current list from the API with what is stored in the DB. Based on the existence or nonexistence of entries as well as the modified dates, guides will be added, deleted, and updated accordingly.
3. Images and videos will be stored as files in private internal storage named based on the hash of the URL.
4. If the guide API call in `GuideViewActivity` is either a no connection error or is from the saved responses, then the favorites list will be checked if there is a guide properly stored for offline viewing. If a favorited guide is present, the guide will be displayed in ""offline mode"" where the images aren't loaded from the internet but rather from the file system. If not, either an error message will be displayed or the previous data will be used but images may be missing.
## Battle plan
1. Write some simple tests using [Espresso](https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/) and maybe [Spoon](http://square.github.io/spoon/) too. These will focus on authentication and very light coverage of every section of the app.
2. ~~Refactor login/authentication to use the built in Account Manager.~~ #188 
3. ~~Add favoriting of guides (just performing the API call).~~ #183 
4. ~~Save all `GET` requests to the DB.~~ #185
5. ~~Implement the `SyncAdapter` to do the heavy lifting of offline storage.~~ #200 
6. ~~Add ""offline mode"" to guide view so it will use the synced data.~~ #200

In any case, using a Service to perform API calls is a bit heavy handed.

anyway. All it really did was add an extra layer of complexity:
1. An Intent had to be created to start the service.
2. Arguments were serialized and unserialized.
3. Retrying dead events required Activities to bind to the service and
   use interprocess communication.

Additionally, ApiService was kept alive and running for weeks after the
app was closed unless the user explicitly killed the app.

Converting ApiService to a class with static methods only resulted in
simplifications and performance improvements. One motiviation to use a
Service was to use it to download guides for offline storage. The backup
framework already has a nice system for handling that so it would only
cause problems to try and use ApiService to do the background work.

3. Include our SSL cert with the app and include it in the certificate chain. We would have to do this for both `www.ifixit.com` and `*.dozuki.com`. http://stackoverflow.com/a/6378872/1135611

3 is really the only reasonable solution.

2) On step 2, upload an image from the camera.
3) Before the image upload response returns, start taking another image from the camera.
4) Wait until the first response returns before accepting the picture. Note: It isn't an issue if the image is cancelled.
5) Step 1 is now the current step even though the images were being uploaded on step 2.

It probably has something to do with the ordering of `APIEvents`, specifically retrying `DeadEvents` and handling the new image in `onActivityResult`.

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Kyle's Android Bug Roundup,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""r-All"")]","General:
- [ ] We need to inject delight. This app should be fun to use. Right now it's functional, but it doesn't get me excited about making a new guide. Fades, animations, some photos on open, etc. When empty, my guides could be a place for a fun image, as would Media Manager.

Create guide:
- [ ] Is there any way we could include the camera metadata in the EXIF, or a tag that shows the photo was taken from the iFixit Android app? Could be useful on image metadata.

Patrol:
- [ ] Make an edit to a guide that will be patrolled. View the guide. Your changes are not shown. Fix: we should show the bleeding edge, unapproved version of a guide once you've started making changes. (Or maybe all the time? Or maybe we need this switch in the app?)

View Guide:
- [ ] Introduction view needs a background image, or something other than a white background
- [ ] Guides section for devices w/o guides yet says 'No guides' Can we invite them to start one now?

Guide intro: 
- [ ] Intro and tools display pages are very plain—perhaps a background image like iOS or a graphic from Tony?
- [ ] On simple guides with just a few tools, you end up with blank intro, blank tools page, no indication there's anything good coming
- [ ] I don't think parts and tools shouldn't be two separate pages. You're never going to fill up both lists, and it's a whole lot of scrolling to get to the interesting part of a guide.

Fixed:
- [x] No indication you need to slide right on the intro, view tools, or step page. 
- [x] Video plays upside down
- [x] <del>Make changes to a step, but don't save. Click Discard Changes. Error: Guide not found.</del> 6d7e765
- [x] <del>Nix 'introduction' and 'review' when you're creating a guide the first time. Not necessary. </del> ed3b7c12117ab52bba7eb5cd35bc554a8103cda0
- [x] Viewing photos: in media manager or guide edit, on the Nexus 10, when I tap on an image to see it big it only fills 1/3 of the screen. I want it bigger! -- Fixed with 4448d11c74f88a4385f408463fb52781610d92fc
- [x] <del>On guide, tap favorites to go to login screen, landscape. Rotate to portrait. Crashes.</del> fixed with d14e74dbd4c5606b987b4acac915b188fa5fca41
- [x] <del>On login screen, rotate tablet. Loses all input to that point. (This can be OK, but it's slightly annoying)</del> Not able to reproduce.  Fixed with d14e74dbd4c5606b987b4acac915b188fa5fca41 i'm guessing.
- [x] You can exceed the bullet text length limit of 350 characters. -- Unable to reproduce, it stops me at 350.
- [x] Let's not show the 'Step title' field on the very first step of a new guide. Only show it after that. You should never title that step anyway. -- Fixed with cb5537ca1fdcdc89d057e2eb6dcbd7bb840808d3
- [x] <del>'Add new bullet' -> 'New line'</del> bd10d11 
- [x] <del>On the list of 'my guides', when you have a very long list, it seems like one out of every 20 or so is 'unfolded' so you can see the buttons. Scrolling, you can see these buttons at regular intervals.</del> -- Fixed with ec45a56546f7749089662bc4ddbe9a37d2ea7c9d
- [x] You can type newlines in bullet text—this shouldn't be allowed.
- [x] Crashed taking guide photo
- [x] Issues with photos saved to a step disappearing, inconsistencies with photo edit interface
- [x] Create a new step, add an image. Put a space as your new line, and save. You get a validation error, and clicking try again just shows the error. (I would expect the error message to go away so I could edit.)  Tapping outside of the error message dumps you out of the guide.
- [x] You can type newlines in the Device name, subject, etc.
- [x] Tablet video doesn't play full screen - e0089f799657624216edc2f057189108a571b113
- [x] Google sign in isn't working. I authenticate with google, and I just end up back on the login screen - 9103dc0cd9989c38fc3009b5638e98ce776cdf63 and b39c73d53b48a69af0ceaa60f9671cf578cfd043
- [x] If you do something bad in the process of creating a guide, you get a 'Validation failed' error over and over with no way to fix it.
- [x] Click publish. It takes a second, so tap it again. You get an error that the state is inconsistent. It should probably not let you tap again until a response has been received, and it would be good to show the user that we're doing something. 9f6a50a78f3f0cf03de02f73d8392a02c0d53d62
- [x] How does publish / unpublish work with patrolling? -- Only users whose edits will be automatically accepted are allowed to make changes to guide privacy.
- [x] CRITICAL: Use an unprivileged user. Make an edit to a high-privilege guide, then go over to My Guides. Unpublish it. The unpublish flag change is held in the patrol queue, but the guide is still marked as private. This is bad. (Denying the edits republishes it, but it's too late.) -- Fixed server-side by disabling patrolled privacy changes.
- [x] Ford is listed as a device, not a category. Different from the iOS app.
- [x] What's the purpose of the reload guide button? It should at least have some visual feedback that it's doing something. See #121 
- [x] 'Device name' -> Should this be 'Start a new guide'?
- [x] 'Finish' -> 'Get started'
- [x] 'Media Manager' -> 'iFixit Media' (otherwise, it could be android photo gallery)  -- Media Manager is the wording we use on the website?  The android photo gallery is called ""Gallery"", I'm not convinced that they would be confused?
- [x] Can we add a big voice dictation button on the line editor somewhere?
- [x] Perhaps you should close the keyboard when you save a step. Otherwise, it's not obvious what to do next.
- [x] If I don't like a photo I just took, how do I remove it from a step? -- Long tap the image and an options menu will show up to remove, copy or detach to media manager.
- [x] When you have an empty media manager, the error is 'No images in your Media Manager. Add images with the icons above!' There are no icons above.
- [x] On complex steps (like a teardown), switching between steps in edit mode stutters, even when the images are already cached. It would be nice to make this smoother.
- [x] There's no obvious way to publish a guide when I'm done with it! I have to go back over to 'My Guides', then find the publish button.
- [x] I got four photos on a step. Took three phtoos, tapped on the left one, and it let me take another. It went on there to the right of the third photo, but wouldn't let me save.  ---  Can't reproduce, any ideas?
- [x] Bad capitalization of iFixit: ""This media manager is linked directly to your Ifixit account.""
- [x] Put the Device Name first, above guide type
- [x] It's not obvious that you swipe to go from one step to the next
- [x] When you take photos upside down on the nexus 10, they initially look correct, but then flip upside down. We probably need to pay attention to the orientation metadata on the server upload. I suspect we'll have similar issues with images rotated in Preview. (Fixed by respecting orientation EXIF data server side)
- [x] I get 'Your changes couldn't be saved because the content has changed' a lot more than I should. I think Edit step isn't refreshing as often as it should be. (I haven't gotten this erroneously in a while. Uncheck this and move it to the top if it's reproducible.)
- [x] The iOS app doesn't show In Progress guides. That's probably a good idea here, too. Except that new guides created from the app will have the in progress flag on them.   This actually isn't true. The iOS app _does_ display In Progress guides. We don't want to remove them because there is still good content in In Progress guides.
- [x] Save and cancel are alternately on different sides of confirmation modals. Standardize. I'd suggest 'Save?' No: Yes. everywhere, but open to suggestions.  I made a quick pass on our dialogs and they all seem consistent since they all call `setPositive` and `setNegative`.
- [x] New guide details -> What are you working on? / Device Name -> Device / Guide Type / Type of guide
- [x] What kind of logging do we have of edits from the app? There is an open pull to log all API edits and the UserAgent that made them.
- [x] There's no way to ever remove the In Progress flag from an Android guide. Maybe that's OK for v1. Flag editing will be done in v2.
- [x] Disable google translate via API on different locales, for now. (When my site profile is set to German, I get content in german. But then I could save German text to English, which would be a bad thing.) -- This isn't an issue anymore now that there is a separate toggle for machine translation of user generated content which will never be on for API consumers.

Media Manager:
- <del>If the user goes to Media Manager and uses the take a picture button, the 
  the picture gets added to images just fine. However, when the user clicks
  on the picture he just took, a ruler image appears instead of the image just
  taken. </del> 91ffcba
- <del>The picture taken from the above bullet is now rotated PI/2 radians clockwise.  </del> can't reproduce
- <del>If the user browses for a local picture and uploads it to the media manager, and
  then afterwards he clicks on that picture which was uploaded from within the
  Media Manager, the application crashes.</del> e83804d
- If the user uploads a png there is no notification that the filetype is 
  unsupported. Furthermore, if the png image added to images is clicked on,
  the app crashes. When the Media Manager refreshes after adding a png,
  the image is just gone.  --- I haven't been able to reproduce it, can you show me on your device?

Login/webview:
- When a logged in user views the answers of some device and clicks logout from
  within the webview, the user logs out from the webview but not the device.
  Furthermore, the user never logs back into the webview even if a different device
  is loaded, the user relogs from within the application, or the application is
  restarted.
## non-bugs / functionality

Media Manager:
- Cannot delete an image just added until after Media Manager has been refreshed.  -- This is expected, but kinda disarming.  should investigate further but not now
- Images in Media Manager are very pixily when downloaded from the server.  --- Should fix, but memory is still a problem.
- <del>If one adds an image to media manager and reloads the media manager before
  the image is ready on the server, the image appears as a ruler in the media
  manager. The image gets loaded on the media manager when it is ready, but it
  does not appear as a non-ruler until the app has been rotated or the media
  manager has been refreshed in some way. Maybe automatically refresh the
  image/media manager once the image is done loading.</del> Can't reproduce

Other:
- <del>When the menu is open and the back button is pressed, I expected it to just 
  close the menu and return to fullview of what I was looking at before. 
  However in adition to returning to fullview, the back button also causes
  the application to go back to the previous screen. If this is done on the
  first screen, the application exits.</del> 73e48fa
- If a teardown (and I'm guessing guides too) have many many steps, the scroll
  bubbles at the bottom of the screen will extend off the screen. Maybe create
  multiple rows of bubbles if the bubbles will extend off screen? See Samsung 
  Galaxy S4 Teardown.  --  Yea this has been an issue for a while, goint to convert to a titlepageindicator to match the guide edit interface
- Add a patrol message for when a normal user edits a guide/teardown.

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Bug Work List,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""r-All"")]","## Features
- [ ] Flag all guides with app edits
- [ ] Disable delete
- [ ] Don't show edit if the user cannot edit the guide.
## Bugs
- [ ] Saving a step that gets put in patrol gives an unhelpful error message.
- [x] The top-right list button (on every page) crashes on my build. Probably the last-minute hacking you were doing.
- [x] Don't show images in my image shelf that aren't > 800x600
- [x] When you're on the image shelf and you take a new photo, scroll to the bottom
- [x] When you click on a product to buy, it takes you to the site in Chrome, which then prompts you to download the android app instead.
- [ ]  tried sign in with google, and google authenticated me then I got a 'Invalid login' in our app. If this is intermittent, I also got something similar in the restaurant on Taylor's phone with normal site registration. 
- [x] App reproducibly crashes every time I open G4 Alumnium 15"" 15.-1.67: DC & Sound Card guide (and a few others on this device). No idea why
- [ ] On very long introductions, the text is cut off underneath the step circles. (see screenshot)
- [x] Typo: ""release my contributions underour open license.""
## UI Problems
- [ ] Add loading progress indicators when deleting, publishing and creating a new guide
- [ ] Add loading screen when viewing topic guides list on phone
- [x] Replace webview on 'Info' with stripped down HTML from API (talk to Stefan)
- [ ] It can be hard to tell how to switch steps on the edit  view. Perhaps an arrow on the sides, to the right of 'step 2'?
- [x] 'Title - ________' looks odd. Can we have a blank field with faint grey 'add title'? Also, I'm afraid the current interface will encourage people to add titles to every step.

These interactions feel very static, and it's hard to know what you can click on. These buttons need an on-tapped state:
- [x] Step edit: add image / trash / save / +
- [x] Bullet edit: all buttons
- [ ] My Guides: Publish / Delete / Edit
- [ ] Anywhere else we have buttons people can interact with
- [ ] Intro: Add thumbnails / pricing to parts & tools
- [ ] Should 'No Guides Available' have an option to start one?
- [ ] I enter my email and password, then click register. It should populate those fields when it asks for user name and confirm password. Or, rethink this interface. It's pretty obnoxious.
- [ ] The ""Leave without saving"" dialog confused me. I could Save or Exit, but not cancel? There's got to be a better way. Probably just 'Save' and 'Cancel'. (I know you can tap outside the modal to cancel, but that's unintuitive.) Or…?
- [ ] Register: We don't need a checkbox to agree. Just put it beneath, and say 'By creating an account, I agree…'

iFixit/iFixitAndroid,closed,Guide Creation release todo,"[Label(name=""r-All"")]","Before we can release the new guide creation functionality to the public (well non-source-building public), we need to address these issues.
## Build + documentation
- [ ] Update readme to include new build instructions for maven with eclipse, intellij and command line. Also update endpoints used.
- [ ] Make sure all dependencies are in some central repository, or at least write a script that downloads and installs all the maven dependencies locally so others building the app can easily get started.
- [ ] Add maven-release-plugin and get the app set up to push tags, update the manifest and export + sign the apk.
## Miscellaneous Pages
- [ ] Help Pages
- [ ] About Page
- [ ] Device Search
## User Guide List
- [x] Add refresh to guide list view.  Right now the only way to refresh the guide list is to kill the app and reload it.
- [x] Editing any guide unpublishes the guide.
- [ ] Expanding the last element in the list view in guide list doesn't move the screen with it, so you have to flick down to see the options.  Also should add some extra padding between the bottom element and the page, that might help as well.
## Create New Guide
- [x] There is no back button option on the logo when editing or creating an introduction.  You have to use the hardware back.
- [x] Device input field needs to autocomplete or at least give a dropdown of options of possible devices or the option to create a new device/topic.  Needs to be topic in the dozuki app. 
- [x] Introduction field in the guide intro is outputting `introduction_rendered` which is the HTML output. Should be bringing in `introduction_raw`.  After saving the intro, the characters are run through html_entites which fucks up all the html into a bunch of goblygunk. 
- [x] Focus should be renamed to subject(?) and it's currently not being populated or saved. 
## Step Creation
- [x] Tapping an empty thumbnail to add an image should let you capture and attach the image directly rather than having to go through the media manager which takes 5 steps to capture and attach the image currently.  This is a critical feature before release since the primary use case we've identified for this app is stubbing out a guide with pictures, then adding text later on the computer.
- [x] Step reorder ""Done"" vs ""Confirm"" options are not intuative. The first two times I interacted with it, I thought ""Done"" was the option to save the step reordering (The checkmark makes it confusing) and I thought it was a bug when it didn't work.  ""Confirm"" is actually what saves.
- [x] Step line text form fields need to be multiline, without newlines.  single line is unuseable when editing existing guide steps or reviewing added text.
- [x] Tapping the main guide image in step create/edit does nothing.  It should bring up a full size image just like the step view. 
- [ ] Clicking confirm on reorder steps without doing anything still sends off a request.  We should check to see if the order changed at all to prevent useless queries. 
- [x] Clean up thumbnail code.  Should use ThumbnailView, instead of explicitly setting each image...
- [ ] Drag and drop reorder thumbnail images
- [x] ""+"" Icon add images if > 1 and < 3
## General
- [ ] Help text needs to be updated.
- [ ] API Error alert dialogs are just using a generic message right now - we should use the specific API error messages.
- [x] Full screen gray background spinner is ugly (actually the generic spinner in general).  It works on long loads, but for short updates, it's not noticeable that it's a loading spinner and it just looks like the page is flickering
- [x] Logging out needs to clear the guide list and bring up the login dialog
- [x] When paging quickly through steps, loading images show no indication that they are loading.  They just pop in.  should have at least a placeholder for them to show something should be there.  
- [ ] Deleting a guide or step needs more ominous/serious warning text.  Deleting a guide is unrecoverable, so it's serious business when you do.  The app makes it really easy to do that, so we need to make sure the user understands.
- [x] We need buttons to view a guide on the user guide list and on step edit.
- [ ] The ordering of tabs on topic view (guides, answers, info) might need to be changed to (guides, info, answers) to avoid bugs with sites without answers.
- [x] Navigation overhaul
## 10in Tablet
- [x] Layout optimizations.  Tablet view is basically the same as the phone, just 1.5-2.5 times bigger.  We should take advantage of the extra screen space.
- [x] Main image is using .standard or .medium size and is about the same size as the thumbnails.  Thumbnails are also too large so they are blurry.  Should use same sizes as guide view
- [x] Tapping any element in portrait mode (like edit guide) rotates the screen 180degress while saving (full screen spinner) and then rotates back.
