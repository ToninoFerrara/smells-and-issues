Please enable a setting to only scan when the app is open with primary focus, or just set that by default."
nadam/nfc-reader,closed,Convert to Library,[],"Hi Adam,

Thanks for sharing the code of your app. It makes an excellent case study.  I am planning to fork your code and refactor it slightly so that it can be used as a Library. Mainly I will be changing getView to getRecord.

I will give you full credit. I just wanted to check with you a couple of things:
1. Do you see it as a complete solution and if not what features are missing? I will add these to the backlog.
2. Would you prefer the repository was hosted on your account so that you get full credit and I am just a contributor?

Thanks from one Adam to another,
Adam.

nadam/nfc-reader,closed,Many folders are missing in the zip-folder,[],"Hello,
I've just downloaded the zip-file and compiled it but then there are everywhere errors and I think it's only because of the imports of some folders which aren't in the download-zip-file:

import android.content.DialogInterface;

import android.os.Bundle;

import android.provider.Settings;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.widget.LinearLayout;

All those and some others aren't possible to import because the folder is missing, or am I wrong?

nadam/nfc-reader,closed,Forward the raw data to a port on the phone,[],"hi,
There is a very good usecase for using the phone's NFC reader on the desktop by connecting it with ADB and running a portforward.

For example, on the phone you could do 

echo Just testing' | nc -l -p 1112  #putting it on port 1112

on the desktop,
do a port forward ""adb tcp:1111 tcp:1112""
read the data from port 1111 - nc 127.0.0.1 1111

Not only this, you could now get desktop apps to read from the forwarded port and have access to the NFC scan data.

Could you add a feature to push NFC scan _raw data_ to a port on android - you can hardcode this.

thanks!
