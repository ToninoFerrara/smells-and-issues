robert7k/sipswitch,open,add receive incoming calls toggle.,[],"my biggest pain, besides being asked on outgoing calls, was the missing ability to quickly enable and disable incoming calls. I added this to the existing widget.

I designed an icon, in accordance to the existing icon set, based on images from Googles Material Design.

also add configChanges=""screenSize"", so the widget can be resized (did not work for me on Android 7.1.2)

I attached a build for no-devs to test. Have Fun! [app-debug.apk.zip](https://github.com/robert7k/sipswitch/files/1393914/app-debug.apk.zip) "
robert7k/sipswitch,closed,Resizing don't works correct,[],"Hi Robert.
You widget is a wonderfull light implementation for using VoIP. All other apps are bigger and so I am choosing your widget from fdoid (v1.1.1) and it works very fine for me. I am using an Honor 4x from stock with OS 4.4.2 and EMUI 3.0 as lancher. 
Afer I installed the widget I could only see the “toogle“ button and the size of the widget was 2x1. I find out if I want see the “configure“ button I have to resize the widget in min. (!) to 3x1. For 2x1 and 1x1 only the toogle button is visible.
Is the correct? It would very nice if I could also use both buttons together in a size of 2x1. Can you check this please.
Thanks in advance.
Marco

robert7k/sipswitch,closed,improve usability,[],"higlights:
- localization
- use official material design icons
- enable 1x1 tile

I didn't manage to solve a single problem: The icon ""mode_sip"" seems not correctly aligned with the other ones. The icon ""mode_ask"", however, is perfectly aligned with ""mode_phone"". That's strange because ""mode_sip"" and ""mode_ask"" only differ in color. Do you know if there are other things interfering (e.g. the indicator or some borders I missed)?

robert7k/sipswitch,closed,sip switch not working on Moto G w/ Android 4.4.2,[],"Hello Robert,

I was not able to get sip switch working on my Moto G with Android 4.4.2 (original FW from motorola/no branding). I've installed the apk (1.0.4) from f-droid. Installation ran flawlessly and widget seems to work. It was possible to create a sip account (registering on our asterisk pbx was also successful) and to toggle call modes. But if I dial a number an error message is shown ""Connection problem or invalid MMI code"". This error occurs no matter what mode is selected (Using sip for all calls, ...). Trying the other direction failed also (sip switch option ""Answer incoming calls"" is activated): If I try to make a sip call to my Moto G nothing happen there (but on our asterisk pbx the call state is ringing - not surprisingly because the registration of the sip account works as mentioned above). What's really weird is that I've installed the same version of sip switch on a Galaxy S5 also running Android 4.4.2 and it works flawlessly. Any ideas?

Greetings, Carsten

Would be great if the widget had an easy one click button to enable / disable 'receive incoming calls'. IMHO the 'settings shortcut' button could be used for that.
