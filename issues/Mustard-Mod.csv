kromonos/Mustard-Mod,open,Synchronize Mustard-Mod between Android devices,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","When using one Mustard-Mod instance on multiple Android device, we should be able to synchronize Mustard state between devices.
This could be achieved with a StatusNet plugin, providing a specific API.
Each Mustard-Mod could save last seen status_id, mention, favorites, configuration, ... and get it back on startup
"
kromonos/Mustard-Mod,open,Keep Last notice on top when update done,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Scrolling timeline after update to find last seen notice is pretty annoying.

When updating timeline, new notices should be inserted on top of timeline, keeping last seen on top.

kromonos/Mustard-Mod,closed,Better display for RTs. Forgot user layout,[],"Add repeated_id TextView in user layout
"
kromonos/Mustard-Mod,closed,Enhance display for repeated notices,[],"When receiving repeated notice, current Mustard Mod version displays it as ""old style"" RT, begining with ""RT @username"". Therefore, text is often more than 140 characters long and got truncated. Since we often have links at the end of notices, we're unable to open them.

Theses 3 commits change the way repeated notices are handled:
- extract & store the original notice in DB, keeping track of repeated `status_id`, repeated `created_at` timestamp (to keep merged timeline working) as well as repeater's `screen_name` (to display who repeated notice).
- Add new layout field to display who repeated the notice. Currently displayed like ""RT by screen_name"".
- Adapt timeline loader to use `repeated_id` and not original `status_id` (so that old notice which were recently repeated won't prevent to load more notices)
