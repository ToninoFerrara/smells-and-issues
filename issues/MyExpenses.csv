mtotschnig/MyExpenses,closed,Add a budgeting option for categories in each month/year,[],"Hey @mtotschnig ,
first of all, I really love this app. I think it's the most complete and yet simple expense tracker, that is also open source.

Nevertheless I have a little suggestion:
Mabye you know the Software YNAB (You Need A Budget). The big point in this expense tracker is, that you assign every expense to a budget. So they basically have budget categories (similar like the current categories in your app) and each of these categories have a limit. So at the start of the month you think about how much money you want to spend on clothes, set this as a limit and go with it. You are always able to see, how much you are over or before the limit. It's important, that you can change budgets on the fly, if something changes (for example your pc breaks and you need a new one right now). There are also yearly budgets (holiday, presents, ...). The last important thing is, that when you set your budgets, the sum of all of them should be the income of your last month (minus potential savings).

I know there is Issue #127 (which is important, too) but I think this one is different, because I describe a budget for each category of one account and not for the whole account.

I've been thinking about it a long time whether to share this or not, but I'd now like to suggest to reconsider the premium options.

I can imagine it being difficult to shuffle options around, esp with existing consumers. But I personally would rather see automated back-up then PDF export as contrib feature, as (IMHO) back-up is more essential/basic than a print-out of all expenses.

as a freelancer who is not an accounting enthusiast, i wanted to try to optimize the accounting work load by using an expense tracking app like yours. recording all the invoices immediately when i buy something  would more than helpful.

unfortunately the app doesn't offer a field where i can track the vat/tax. without this field, i would have to go through all the bills again to record the tax information after importing it to my desktop app / libre office calc.
having an option to in the settings like ""[ ] track tax"" (so it would not confuse private user), ""configure tax table"" and the addition of a dropdown of this taxes in the `new transaction` user interface would be awesome.

looking at the quicken format, i saw that it would allow to track such tax information:
```
X 	Extended data for Quicken Business. Followed by a second character subcode (see below) followed by content data. 	Invoices 	XI3
XC 	Tax account 	Invoices 	XC[*Sales Tax*]
XR 	Tax rate 	Invoices 	XR7.70
XT 	Tax amount 	Invoices 	XT15.40
```
i haven't tested if it can be easily imported into a normal/personal accounting app like gnucash. gnucash itself would allow to create incomming business invoices (but the interface is rather cumbersome). it is necessary to provide a tax account.

Last week my phone crashed & I had to start anew. I hadn't updated the app in a while, but now with the fresh installation I have the latest version. I noticed that in a split transaction it is no longer possible to add a payee?

In M.E. this would be a split with a transfer (€ 30 to my 'wallet' account) and a transaction (€ 7 spent on food to that particular supermarket).

Hello, MyExpenses community!

I represent a team of MSIT-SE students from Innopolis University (Innopolis, Russian Federation).
Our Master's program includes a course named 'Methods: Deciding what to Design'. 

In this course we have a team project. The main idea of the project is to learn how to work with product requirements.
At the beginning of the project we got several tasks:

1. Find an open-source Android project.
2. Find potential customer for this project.
3. Define with customer features to be added, modified and removed from the project.
4. Implement these features.
5. Present our results to the customer and the application community.


All members of our team like the idea of financial management. And we thought that our experience could be useful for you.
And, as you can see, we chose MyExpenses application. 


We have almost completed the work on this project, and want to demonstrate you our results.
It would be great, if you will provide us some feadback about changes that we made. 
Or, maybe, you will find something interesting or useful, and include these features in the future versions of MyExpenses.


# MyExpenses CHANGELOG

## New features

1. Welcome slides with short description about main application features.
2. Currencies screen with a current exchange rate.
3. SMS-parsing for a quickly tracking from the debit/credit cards.
4. Find banks near your and show its' working state. 
5. Notifications not to forget to track expenses.

## Modifications
1. Main application screen
	1.1. Simplify design of transaction list.
	1.2. Redesign of Accounts sidebar.
	1.3. Updates in Application menu.
2. Statistics page
	2.1. Redesign (layout, styles, charts settings).
	2.2. Ability to switch between accounts on statistics page.
3. Interaction with categories
	3.1. Lock ability not to select category of transaction.
	3.2. Restructure categories (change type and remove dublicates).


## Removed features
1. Export/import to QIF format. 
QIF format is used by Microsoft Money. But this service/application is not supported now.
2. Print.
As practice shows, this feature is not used by mobile application users. It is more relevant for the desktop users.
3. Tell a friend.
This function is not often used. The most popular case is recommendations and high rating in Google Play.

And this is perfectly ok when you immedeatly enter your purchases when you made it but it becomes kind of a clicking hassle for all the purchases you didn't/couldn't enter in the app immeadeatly.

for all those purchases i save the recipes and enter them all at once when they eat up too much space in my wallet.
at almost all of these i need to completely input the date and time and they are usually not so close to the current date that it would be reasonable to scroll to the desired date.
luckyli one can cklick on the date and then you can conveniently enter it.

but a you need to click on it and be they don't go automatically to the next.
so in for the time field i need to click 4 times (just to be able to type in the numbers)

e.g:

so what i ask for is:
1. change the month format to numbers instead of the full name (needed in order for this to be really usefull and it also is standard format on the recipies (at least around here)
2. merge the date and time field into one
3. focus the input field automatically on opening.
4. automatically switch to the next field when first one is filled out (so i can straightly type 1243 and it will have the value 12:43 as time)

thats all and it would greatly improve my workflow. i think this are rather minor changes. but maybe there are complications at least some things like the ""focus on opening"" should really be easy and every step i actually already helping so even if they're not completet at the same time they would help.

"
mtotschnig/MyExpenses,open,Tags/labels instead of categories,"[Label(name=""roadmap_vote"")]","Hello! Thanks for this neat app :-) I have just none hurdle before I can really use it as I would like to.

Is there are specific reason why MyExpenses and every other personal finance tool I tried so far provide categories (and hierarchical subcategories) instead of tags/labels like for example GMail does. Hierarchy can still be mapped with nested labels and they offer the IMHO huge advantage of being able to apply several tags to one expense.

Use case example: In addition to generally tracking expenses for food, maybe one wants to break that whole chunk down into nutrition types (dairy, meat, fish etc.) or place of purchase (market vs. mall) or even brands.

Another example: travel expenses occur within different contexts (commuting, leisure time, business travel etc.). Being able to apply specific tags for that not only to these expenses, but also to others that occur in the context of it would IMHO be very helpful.

@mtotschnig I noticed in #85 that you already use a bounty system. If you consider a tag/label feature worthwhile, what would be an appropriate bounty?

mtotschnig/MyExpenses,closed,optimized qif format for gnucash,[],"Für den Import in gnucash sollte das qif output Format optimiert werden.
Denn gnucash kann mit der Notiz zu einem Buchungssatz nichts anfangen, Der wird beim Import einfach ignoriert.
Gebe ich z.B. als Empfänger ""Deutsche Bahn"" an und vermerke in der Notiz die Reise, taucht diese in gnucash nicht mehr auf.

Bisher sieht der output so aus:
D11/07/2012
T-49,80
MFahrt nach Frankfurt
LFahrtkosten : Fahrtkosten
PDeutsche Bahn

durch eine Einstellungsmöglichkeit, sagen wir ""gnucash import"" in den Einstellungen könnte doch der Buchungssatz anders geschrieben werden.

z.B.
D11/07/2012
T-49.80
LFahrtkosten : Fahrtkosten
PDeutsche Bahn - Fahrt nach Frankfurt 
Also, die Notiz hinter den Empfänger

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////7
For the import in gnucash the ""qif"" output format should be optimized.
Because gnucash can not deal with the note in the record. It will simply be ignored during import.
If I give e.g. as a receiver ""Deutsche Bahn"" and put the destination into the notes field, this will not be shown in gnucash.

So far, the output looks like this:
D11/07/2012
T-49,80
MFahrt nach Frankfurt
LFahrtkosten : Fahrtkosten
PDeutsche Bahn

by providing a new menu entry, lets say ""gnucash import"" in the preferences menu, the new record could look like

D11/07/2012
T-49.80
LFahrtkosten : Fahrtkosten
PDeutsche Bahn - Fahrt nach Frankfurt 

So, the note behind the receiver

mtotschnig/MyExpenses,closed,Allow negative initial value for an account,[],"I use MyExpenses to track my credit card payments.

As this is a monthly debited credit card, the virtual account I use for that is always negative. But as I can't key a negative value as initial value, I am not aware of the total amount of payments I'm affording.

Work around: I enter a  first operation to reach the negative amount of my account, then reinitialize and erase the generated extract.
