The [SuperSU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu) log clearly shows NTPSync successfully chmoding `/dev/alarm` to mode 666 and back. Oddly, there are no log entries with the tag `NTPSync` and I haven't been able to trigger the making of any Debug-level entries with `/data/local.prop`.

A [StackExchange answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8739074/setting-system-time-of-rooted-phone#8752130) lays out the `/dev/alarm` technique, but goes on to claim that on newer Samsung firmwares, it doesn't work because of SELinux restrictions, and that use of `date` is needed.

So, how about some use of `date` if `setCurrentTimeMillis` fails? Or at least an error message.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install NTPSync 1.3 from Play Store
2. Check offset with &quot;Detailed query!&quot;
3. Sync wit &quot;Query and set time!&quot;
4. Check again.

Expected: A significantly lower offset
Instead: Nearly the same offset (in my case it was about 7000ms)

The error occurs with version 1.3 (from the Play Store) on a HTC Incredible S, running Cyanogenmod 7. Version 1.2 (from FDroid) has no problems.

It would be useful if ntpsync could automatically sync date after a given interval of time (i.e. sync every 6 hours, every 12 hours, every 24 hours, every week, et cetera).

The &quot;Set on boot&quot; is fine, but I don't reboot my phone very often and my clock lags so I have to sync date manually.
