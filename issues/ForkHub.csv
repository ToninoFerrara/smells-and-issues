I don't like the idea of translated text (Cyrillic) with non-translated words (Latinic) mixed in. Considering the fact that some words are used so widely in their intrinsic form (such as 'commits' or 'pull requests'), there's no need to translate them with many words like they did in old manuals, which are very hard to comprehend exactly because of such weird worded constructs. As long as we translate (i.e. write in Cyrillic), let's do it for all of the words (pull requests, forks, gists etc.), not for 'commits' only.

Speaking of 'collaborators', 'соучастники' is not a proper word, it's rather 'joint offenders' or 'accessory to the crime', and when you speak about collaboration (meaning participation) it's 'участники'.

great app.

I do have a number of questions pertaining to PR management within the app.

Are you considering PR support fully complete in its current implementation?

I am asking because from what I have seen in the app there are certain things I can't do.

i)   Closing a PR upstream that I opened and checked that I could close it using github's Web UI
ii)  Opening a PR from within my fork of someone else's repo which I also made sure I could do again using github's Web UI

For more details on my question you can check out this video demonstrating everything live: https://youtu.be/XdNxWM2HRb8

jonan/ForkHub,closed,Update iconography,[],"This issue has several components; they can be broken into separate issues for further discussion if needed, but they're all linked, so I'm going to start by grouping them into this one issue.

First, I think the policy of using strictly GitHub icons isn't the best. I understand it for GitHub-specific concepts, like forks, gists, and bookmarks. However, for other concepts, like ""search"", ""add"", ""comment"", and ""save"", I don't see a particular reason to favor GitHub's icons over those provided by Google. Both GitHub's and Google's icons are very similar, and using Google's would definitely help the app feel more native to Android.

Second, all of the icons with name of the form `menu_*.png` are neither GitHub specific icons, or their modern Material equivalents. We should be able to update these without issue. However, most of them seem to be used only in menu items with `showAsAction` set to `never`, so the icons are never actually displayed. These should probably be removed to shrink APK size a bit.

Third, for the GitHub octicon icons that are used throughout the app, we should update those to include `xxhdpi` and `xxxhdpi` sizes and re-render them in opaque white (or black, for the navigation drawer) so that they fit in with existing iconography better.
