hypeapps/Endoscope,open,Option to enable torch during RTSP streaming sessions,[],"Hello,

Is there any way to enable the torch (light) for a camera whilst streaming the video?

Once the streaming begins, the torch is turned off (and can't be enabled through the menu).

Even more ideally, it'd be nice to be able to specify this option remotely e.g. through the RTSP URL (if such a thing is possible).

Many thanks for this software.

I'd implement this myself if only I knew how! Sadly, Android isn't my area of expertise."

I installed Endoscope from F-droid this morning (v 1.2) right after having updated to the latest CyanogenMod nightly (Android 5.1) on my phone. I started the stream and opened rtsp://192.168.x.x:8086 to see the stream: worked fine. I could even reduce VLC's buffer to 100 ms and get a pretty snappy video (default codec, H264) and same with sound.

Then, I rebooted my phone, and tried to do the same thing again. This time, I start the stream and Endoscope crashes as soon as a client tries to view the stream. VLC and Kodi trying to access the stream both lead to Endoscope crashing.

The only difference between this morning and now is that on reboot, Android ""optimised"" the app.
Could this be the cause of Endoscope crashing?

There is one minor issue with your app: you don't seem to increase the `versionCode` and `versionName` in the build.gradle. This is important for google play as it is for f-droid. As f-droid only takes the source code from upstream, f-droid needs the versionCode to be updated from inside git.

I see the app on google play has version 1.1 already. Can you remember to also push the version updates to the github repository, so that f-droid can track that?

In the ideal case, update the versions in one commit, and then tag that commit with a git tag. This way, f-droid can be set up to automatically update your application.
