grote/Liberario,open,"[2.0.3] When entering destination, start location gets set as well","[Label(name=""bug üêû"")]","**Describe the bug**
Version 2.0.3 introduced a strange behaviour on my device.
It broke the app for me, I had to downgrade to 2.0.2.

When entering the ""startng station"" everything is alright. I can choose the correct ""start from"" station.
After that, when entering the destination, I can search for it and choose it. But the second i choose the destination, the ""start from"" station field is filled with the station i chose as destination.

This happens with every destination station i choose.

So after entering data i get:

Start Station: STATION I CHOSE AS DESTINATION
Destination:  STATION I CHOSE AS DESTINATION

I am using the Deutsche Bahn provider only.
Everything used to work without problems (and still does) with 2.0.2.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

More often than not, I am using Transportr to find the time, when I have to leave to be at my destination at a certain time. It is frustrating, that I have to click the clock icon to set the time and then the Menu icon > Time is > Arrival.

I also believe, this uses more data, because as soon as I set the time, Transportr checks for connections at the new time.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

IMHO the best way would be, to have a toggle in the screen for entering the time. This toggle would switch between departure and arrival time. The reason why I believe, this is the best place, is as follows: Nearly all of the time when searching for connections to be at the destination at a certain time, the time setting screen has to be called up.

grote/Liberario,closed,Keyboard disappears after each typed character in lockscreen-mode,"[Label(name=""bug üêû"")]","**Describe the bug**
If I try to search for a destination or a departure location in lockscreen-mode, Transportr hides the keyboard after each character I typed either in the ""from"" or ""to"" field. Instead, a list with suggestions of recent locations is shown (this list is not the problem. The problem is, that the keyboard is hidden).

To show the keyboard again, in order to be able to type in the next character of my location, I need to tap into the input-field, hold my finger on the screen and swipe downwards. Then I am able to type one additional letter. For the next letter, I need to repeat the swiping-down-motion.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Make sure that the option ""Show Transportr over the lockscreen"" is activated
2. Make sure, that there are some locations stored (e.g. that you searched for ""Berlin Hbf"" and accepted a suggestion from Transportr)
3. Start Transportr
4. Klick on the button for creating a new search
5. Lock the screen (my screen turns black at this point)
6. Wake the screen up (pressing e.g. the home button, to show Transportr over the lockscreen)
7. Try to type into the field ""from"" or ""to""

**Expected behavior**
That Transportr shows the same behaviour as it would if it was not in lockscreen-mode, i.e. that the Keyboard is shown on the bottom half of the screen permanently.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
First of all thank you for this great app.
I'm using Transportr every day for years now and I really love the new UI but I have a problem with the new dark map design. I use dark themes in Android wherever possible. And I also like the dark theme of Transportr2, but unfortunately it is very hard for me to ""read"" the dark maps of Transportr 2. The color deviations in the dark map are simply too small for convenient use in normal ambient light. Maybe it is worse because I'm red-green colorblind (as 5% of the people out there) but I know some (not colorblind) people who switched off the dark night map design of their car navigation system because they have problems to read the dark maps. So this seems to be a common problem.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be really helpful to have the option to switch theme and map design separately or a third theme named ""dark menu, light map"" or so.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

The stations are clickable when searched for with the ""Stations nearby"" feature. Instead, this should be applied to the map by default. The station in my home town does get a symbol, but it is not clickable. Instead I have to hold down onto it, click ""Stations nearby"" and then select the then opened red circle.

In Vienna, Austria, local trains (S-Bahnen) are part of the public transport network and don't require a separate ticket, and I'd expect them to be included in searches (they are, for example, on the website of Wiener Linien, Vienna's public transit company).

In Transportr, the Wiener Linien search never shows any S-Bahn even if it would be by far the most logical and fast option.

An alternative for looking up routes in Vienna is the VOR network (for a larger area that includes Vienna), it includes S-Bahnen but it doesn't do addresses, you can only search station to station.

√ñBB, the austrian railway, works fine in Vienna, includes S-Bahnen and does addresses, but it is hard to use because the suggestions include stations all over Austria.

So‚Ä¶ if there is any way to make S-Bahnen show up when Wiener Linien is selected, either here at Transportr or by asking nicely at some other place, that would be really great :)"

grote/Liberario,open,NPE when searching return trip with empty current location,"[Label(name=""bug üêû"")]","**Describe the bug**
First off: Not 100% sure if I'd call all of this a bug, but it seems a bit unintuitive for me. It's about the app's behavior when selecting a previously saved location (home / work).

**To Reproduce**
First behavior:
1. Open the app
2. Tap on ""Home""
3. You'll land on the next screen with the trip start being focused and empty; the destination is home.

Second behavior:
1. Open the app
2. Tap on the three dots next to home, click on ""return trip"" (I'm not 100% sure about the translation, I'm using the german locale and it's called ""R√ºckfahrt suchen"")
3. The home address is now the start address

In the second case I had expected the home address to be the destination of my return trip, whereas in the first case I had expected it to be the destination. Selecting a return trip to an address and seeing it used as the start for that return trip seems buggy.

Additionally, I'm getting the following error when trying to reproduce the second behavior:

This is with the DB provider, in case it matters. I realize it says to open a bug report in the PTE repository, but my guess is that there's a location query before I have a destination resulting in the error, so it's expected behavior from the public transport enabler.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The map does not feature much information regarding public transit lines. You can find railway lines when looking closely, but subway and bus lines are completely hidden.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

The map should feature the line data (this is available in OpenStreetMap for the most part, also often times with the appropiate colours). There are multiple map styles that feature better transit information (e.g. [√ñPNVKarte](√∂pnvkarte.de), [transit map from openstreetmap.org](openstreetmap.org)); only [OSMTransport](http://demo.3liz.com/osmtransport/) features coloured line information, though it seems very broken and also probably only displays the information over the map instead of rendering it into it.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
-

**Additional context**

With a bit of guidance I might be able to implement it myself, though I am neither familiar with the structure of the app nor with Android app development past Android 4.4.

I really like the view and UX flow Google Maps provides regarding this feature. Stations that appear on the map with an icon are always clickable, and lines are rendered onto the map (at least trams, subways, light and commuter rail and heavy rail). This should be extended to busses as they often times are the only way to reach many destinations.

Laying lines over the map is already embedded into the app in the map view when navigation is active, this component could be reused. But I believe that this uses the information of the network provider/pte, this would then have to be swapped for OpenStreetMap input.

I really like the map style, adding line and station information to it would certainly increase the usefulness to me."

It seems that it is not taking these delays into account when planning a trip but it does show the delays when looking for all the buses arriving to a particular stop.

For example, in the following screenshot, I'm looking for bus connections from the stop ""Malm√∂ Centralstation"" to ""Malm√∂ Fullriggaren"":

![transportr_bug_screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5726697/43390316-2e688fe0-93ee-11e8-88cf-451fd46912b6.png)

In the connection highlighted in the red rectangle, it is saying that the bus is expected to arrive ""Malm√∂ Centralstation"" at 11h46, which is the original expected time. But looking at the official app from the bus company, I can see that the bus is going to be a few minutes late, it will arrive at 11h49 instead.

It seems that the Transportr app is not taking into account these delays when planning for trips but it does if we look into the list of all buses arriving to the stop ""Malm√∂ Centralstation"":

We can see that there is ""+3"" in red which is how many minutes the bus is delayed. I was wondering why is this information is not showing in the first screenshot. Is this something done by design or is it a potential bug/missing feature?

This is the only thing that prevents me from using Transportr full time, it is very helpful to know when the buses are not arriving exactly on time.

**To reproduce:**
1. Choose area to ""SE, Sweden, Stockholm"" (it works for the entire country)
2. Look for buses going from ""Malm√∂ Centralstation"" to ""Malm√∂ Fullriggaren"" in the 30th of July around 11h40 to see the bus number 5 leaving at 11h46 
3. Then look for all departures from ""Malm√∂ Centralstation"" around the same date to see the bus marked as delay, not leaving at 11h46 anymore

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Problem: I am having a hard time entering origin and destination for a trip via the map. I am trying to think my way into the new UI and hope that this proposal suits its ‚Äúphilosphy‚Äù. My suggestion is: after long-pressing a location and tapping on the three dots at the bottom, I would like to see both ‚ÄúFrom here‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo here‚Äù as options, and if I use these options and then press the back button to the return to the map, what I entered from my previous use of the map using either the large button or the ‚ÄúFrom here‚Äù item should not be lost. I don‚Äôt know if there is some smart logic there trying to figure out whether I want ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù or ‚ÄúTo‚Äù in the context menu. If that is the case then it‚Äôs not working for me and I would prefer to be able to choose myself. Since what I am trying to define is a trip, it seems natural to me that I should be able to tell the UI both the origin and destination via the map. I can‚Äôt figure out how.

![screenshot_20180728-113549](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8028279/43355395-b777a828-925b-11e8-87f6-a4314846d243.png)

My assumption (correct me if that‚Äôs impossible) is that I would long-press one location, choose it as ‚ÄúFrom here‚Äù which would take me to the UI with the two controls for entering origin and destination, I could then tap the back button to return to the map, long-press another location and choose ‚ÄúTo here‚Äú (via context menu or the large button) which would return me to the two controls with the previous value chosen via ‚ÄúFrom here‚Äù still present.

As a bonus I would add ‚ÄúVia here‚Äù as a third option.

Another suggestion I would have that might not be in line with the new UI is that the options show up immediately in the style of a right-click context menu, saving that extra tap on the three dots.

**Additional context**
1. I am thinking about trips that do not involve my current location as origin or destination.

2. I‚Äôm not entirely sure yet what the large button on the map does. It does seem to be the ‚ÄúTo here‚Äù function that I am missing. But this is all very implicit, an icon (i.e. picture rather then text) is not immediately understandable for a new user like myself. In any case, the issue that I can‚Äôt seem to define both origin and destination via the map remains.

3. FYI: I am only now really starting the use and hopefully understand the new UI. (You know why ‚Ä¶ the thought that all locations I enter turn up in the history bla bla ‚Ä¶ I am not making this up.)"

Please check the following boxes with an `x` if they apply:
* [x] The feature I want to propose would be useful for the majority of users, not only for me personally.
* [x] I am aware that Transportr is mostly developed by one person in their unpaid spare time.
* [ ] I can help myself to get this feature implemented or know someone who wants to do it.
* [ ] If I want to add support for a new region or country, I checked that this is already available in [public-transport-enabler](https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler/) and know the process [described on the Transportr homepage](https://transportr.app/contribute/#translating-into-your-language).

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It is annoying, that I must always click the ""search""/""route"" button when I need a connection. In version 1.*.* the program immediately showed the route form.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Display the search form first when starting transportr (like version 1). The map is not that important."

Here, it shows house number 68 instead of 72.

I looked into the source code and it seems you are using Nominatim. Strangely, when performing the same query on their website, the address is correctly resolved. https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse.php?format=html&lat=48.50184845693443&lon=9.055255651474&zoom=18

Some addresses in the area were added within the last few months, so maybe the used data is not up to date?! But I wonder how that can be the case when querying Nominatim. On the other hand, I also have issues finding certain addresses from the new search bar you implemented. Some house numbers appear there, some not.

Since I do not fully understand why this issue appears, I decided to open a bug report here.

grote/Liberario,open,Split calendar exports into 1 item per leg,"[Label(name=""beginner job üî∞""), Label(name=""enhancement üèóÔ∏è"")]","As a transportr-using traveler who usually has at least one switch-over, I would like the app to push with situationally useful info to the top of exported calendar item(s), so that I have to interact less with the device while on the move.

Currently, it puts [`trip.from.name + "" ‚Üí "" + trip.to.name`](https://github.com/grote/Transportr/blob/8c911664ae31338ede1d0209d474ab9c7b2cb8db/app/src/main/java/de/grobox/transportr/trips/detail/TripUtils.kt#L46-L56) into the calendar item title and all other details into the item description.

> Please disregard the unnecessary switch-over in Berlin in this example. Was just the first one that came to my mind.

Unfortunately, info that's needed for the switch-over (such as `position` & other `context`) are not easily visible and I usually have to unlock the phone, open the calendar and scroll down within the item to look up the next switch-over's details.

Please consider moving the situationally important details like `leg.departure`, `‚Ä¶Position` and `leg.line` out of the description and into the title field of the item. E.g. like this:

![transportr-cal-export-better](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9948149/43048934-0d74b088-8df0-11e8-8463-aa32090350e7.png)

This allows my phone to show me a few minutes before the scheduled end of one leg, where I need to go during the switch-over. At a single glance, and people could more easily compare transportr-provided info with the displays at the train station.

1. Install Transportr 2.0.0 using F-Droid (I haven't checked the Google Play version, I don't have Google Apps/Services installed).
2. Open the application, choose Finland‚ÜíHelsinki (HSL) as region.
3. Tap the ‚ÄúSearch here‚Äù entry and type some location, for example ‚ÄúViiskulma‚Äù (it's an intersection), ‚ÄúRautatientori‚Äù (a square) or ‚ÄúKeskuskatu‚Äù (a street).

- Enabling ADB in the system settings and watching the output from `adb logcat` does not show anything particularly interesting.

When searching for a location in the search bar above there is no problem, but then when trying to search a route from that location the app crashes. The only situation in which it doesn't crash is when re-searching an already saved route via the main screen. This leaves the app unusable for most purposes when location services is off.

After searching for a destination on the main page, and hitting the red floating Directions button, I'm taken to a screen where I can enter in my starting position. There are a few options available already too such as my home and work.

I want to leave from my home, so I press my home, and instead of the starting position changing to my home, the destination has, and I have to go all the back to the beginning to get that destination back.

Ideally, the following would happen:

1. I'd select Directions for a destination
2. I'm taken to the directions screen, with the Starting Position box preselected
3. At this point I can start typing a starting position or select one of the available options
4. Selecting my home position should pre-fill the starting position

Ideally whatever field the cursor is currently in should be replaced when tapping a location, which feels intuitive. Then all that would be necessary is having the starting position field preselected instead of the destination field.

The problem is that I don't always have the same starting point. This leads to me only using this feature when starting from home, because for me to use it from anywhere else would force me to tap it, wait for the query to finish, go back, change the starting point and query again.

What I would love to see is an option to interchange the favourite connections panel below the input mask for a favourite destinations panel. This would behave differently in that it would change the destination and start the query, but leave the starting point intact.

# Solution
Add an option to interchange the favourite connections panel for a favourite destination panel which leaves the starting point intact on interaction.


In the next couple of days I could also try to create a mockup or add more details, if wished."

grote/Liberario,closed,Feedback Transportr 2.0.0-beta1,"[Label(name=""question ‚ùì"")]","Hi,

thank you for developing Transportr, it is a great and very useful app. I've tried Transportr 2.0.0-beta1 on Android 6 and would like to give some feedback.

- Using the Spain provider (which based on Navitia data), I experience a strange bug. Every time I look up a street there is now a ""0"" added to the street name; this wasn't the case in earlier versions of Transportr.

![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23173049/33079806-d1f96072-ced6-11e7-88e6-d941177a00a1.jpg)


- Selecting time and date of travel is a bit cumbersome. It's only one tap to access the time menu, but I am still missing the ""+15"" button which I found really helpful. There is a ""now"" button in the time menu, but I don't think this is necessary, because simply holding the time icon in the upper corner sets the time to now. 

- Changing the date of travel is a bit trickier: you have to select the time menu and then click again so that the calender view will open up. That seems a bit too complicated to me (I am aware of the option to select ""today"" and ""tomorrow"", but it is not always useful) and was easier with the old Transportr app.

- Setting the time to ""arrival"" or ""departure"" also has gotten more complicated, with the integration in the context menu. It should be possible to change that when selecting the time and date of travel.

- When starting the app it shows me the map, a search box, home and work option, favourites, and the latest connections I looked up. Then when clicking on an option (let's say the work option), the app takes me to another screen where these options (home and work option, favourites, and the latest connections) are shown again (until the current position is loaded or a starting point is selected). Is this behaviour intended? I find it rather redundant to show the same information twice.

The redesign with the new map is nice, but to me the app feels less simple and elegant than it was. 

I hope this feedback is helpful.

I tested it and I found some weird information:

The only way to reach the metro station is to get S5 train to Rho-Fiera and by foot go to the metro station. transportr tell me to get off the train to Rho and reach Rho f.s.

3. Canegrate-via Cesare Saldini (50, there is no address number support), Milano

Finally, if some one would implement this, I recommend to do this as well for the other pair of buttons (the ""+15 minutes"" on the left) - guess that's also more intuitive and consistent.

If not good as standard configuration - this would be great for an additional option in 'Settings', too.

grote/Liberario,closed,Save trips as Repeating Trips and notify on changes,"[Label(name=""enhancement üèóÔ∏è""), Label(name=""unresolved ü§õ"")]","# Use case

I'd like to cover the following use case:

- A user regularly commutes from A to B, for instance every weekday from her home to her workplace.
- She wants to get notified if her regular trip is not possible or will be delayed, for instance because of construction works.

# Implementation and UI

I suggest the following implementation:

- First: implementation of #171 
- Then, at the same UI point where a single trip can be save, another option for this feature shall be there, for instance:
  - ""Save trip""
  - ""Save as repeating trip and notify on changes""

A click on the latter would open a new screen, with the following options:

- _Weekdays_ with 7 checkboxes from Monday to Sunday, with 5 checkboxes from Monday to Friday preselected
- _Notify on changes_ with 3 checkboxes 
  - 24 hours before
  - 12 hours before
  - 1 hour before

In the main menu, under _Recent Trips_ add a new item _Repeating Trips_. Click on it will list all saved repeated trips, with the ability to edit the weekdays and the time point when to check.

# Functionality

What Transportr would do:

- Fetch the connection with the saved _From_, _To_ and _Departure time_ at the set time point, e.g. 12 hours before.
- If the fetched result has a diff to the saved connection, create a Push notification which links to a screen with the newly fetched connection. Otherwise, do nothing."

It's true that in the search, the full name of the stop appears. What bothers me is that in ""Recents"", it doesn't - so I can't reproduce a search without typing everything again.

A suggestion - I don't know if it is technically feasible: why not show the place name whenever a route goes through more than one place? In other words, if I get a schedule to go from the train station to the post office in the same town, I don't need the details but if I go from one town to another, I think I really do.

1. Es gibt in Transportr bislang keine Unterscheidung des Fernverkehrs in ICE (DB: ""Produktklasse A"") und IC/EC (DB: ""Produktklasse B""). Da beide unterschiedlich tarifiert bzw. die Fahrkarten entsprechend ausgestellt sind, w√§re zumindest f√ºr Deutschland diese Unterscheidung sehr wichtig.

2. F√ºr Aktionstickets (z. B. Wochenendticket, L√§ndertickets) gab es bisher bei der DB die sehr hilfreiche Checkbox ""nur Nahverkehr"". Diese ist wohl bei der DB nun in die Auswahl-Reihe integriert, was inkonsistent ist (D/IRE ist auch Nahverkehr, U-Bahn und Tram/Bus nur bedingt, in Berlin bspw. bei manchen Aktionstickets schon, im Vor-/Nachlauf zum Fernverkehr nicht). Der Aus-/Einschluss von F√§hre, Seilbahn und AST scheint jedoch bei der Nutzung von Transportr kaum erforderlich, da √ºber einen Via-Punkt im Zweifel eine unerw√ºnschte F√§hre/Seilbahn auch umgangen werden kann und AST meist nur fahren, wenn sonst nichts anderes geht.

3. Daher mein Vorschlag f√ºr Neugestaltung der Auswahl-Checkboxen:
- ICE (""high speed train"")
- IC/EC (""long distance train"")

It's a minor annoyance to have to zoom in every time I look at the map from so far out, but overall it is not a major bug. It seems to happen on all routes in Vienna but I haven't been systematic about my testing.

They show, in order: 1) the route; 2) the first screen shown after clicking the map button for a route, auto-zoomed out to include the errant waypoint; 3) the info about the errant point; 4) the full actual route on the map of Vienna; 5) the route zoomed to the missing section around the point (here ""Simmering S+U"") that is missing/in the Atlantic.

This should also be relevant to #234, but it does not introduce a string for every network, (I used strings only where the name differed from the network name. If you want to I can also add strings for those cases.)

From my standpoint this can be merged, however I am also open for discussion. If anything should be changed I can rebase my PR.

Apart from that, I fear this will mess with transifex. I made some strings that where translatable (and still have translations) non-translatable and swapped one or two strings (name with desc). I did not touch the translated string-files since I do not know the translation-workflow.

I think I pinned this down: It only happens when I change the orientation of the phone from landscape to portrait WHILE closing/pushing in the physical keyboard. The keyboard or orientation changes alone do not trigger this. Also changing from portrait to landscape while flipping the keyboard out, works fine.
It even works when closing the keyboard while in landscape, wait a bit and then turn to portrait.

I guess the app gets two events and somehow runs into the Nullpointer in this special case. Maybe some kind of race condition?

This might sound pretty rare, but I run into this basically every time I use the app. Cause I open in portrait, switch to landscape with keyboard to enter the stations and then go back to portrait without keyboard to look at the results.
Hope you can help.

They could be used in two different ways:
- A single tap on the button of a station inserts it into the currently selected field (either start or end)
- A swipe from one button/station to another (or dragging one button onto another, or drawing a line from one to another, whatever you want to call it) immediately looks up that connection, like a press on a favorited connection does right now.

As the current functionality is included in the new pattern, nothing is lost by that change. On the other hand, connections from any favorite station to any other favorite station could be looked up easily without needing 2*n! favorite connections.

grote/Liberario,closed,"Make vibrating optional, disable by default","[Label(name=""enhancement üèóÔ∏è"")]","I noticed that https://github.com/grote/Transportr/commit/b6c5d2c0e0d9f8882836ea2184533b01e7c98b24 introduced vibrating on long-clicking an option.

If there is one thing I'd like to call an antifeature, it is this.

I'd recommend at very least disabling this by default for the following reasons:
- Basically not a single other Android app does this, which makes Transportr inconsistent with expected behaviour.
- It is annoying. I feel like a lab rat being punished for doing an action whenever my device vibrates when I do it. And yes, I know this is an opinion, but a very strong one of mine, and I will not upgrade beyond 1.0.0-beta2 in its current state (in normal circumstances, I simply uninstall apps who do things like this).

Instead of vibrating, I'd like to recommend to just show a toast. You want to direct the user's attention to a small, otherwise easy to miss change. Toasts are literally made for this specific purpose. On systems that support it, you could even use a snackbar with an UNDO button: https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/snackbars-toasts.html#snackbars-toasts-usage.

However, on Android 5, only the date itself (08 Oct 2015) is shown. As I orient myself on the weekday (I know it is Thursday today, so I need to plan the journey for Friday), this forces me to scroll down from my notification area every time I plan a trip to make sure I am entering the right date.

It would be good if Liberario could use a Material DatePicker, at least on Android 5, so that it would be obvious what weekday is chosen. Some example screenshots are shown on https://github.com/wdullaer/MaterialDateTimePicker#material-datetime-picker---select-a-timedate-in-style.

grote/Liberario,closed,Improve Performance when Auto-Completing Locations,"[Label(name=""enhancement üèóÔ∏è"")]","  We are working on a project called PersisDroid (http://www.cudroid.com/PersisDroid/) for detecting potential performance issues. Our tool could find performance degradation caused by improper usage of asynchronous executions.
  We find that in some cases your app may suffer a long processing delay.

Case 1:
  **Related source code**  Class: de.grobox.liberario.adapters.LocationAdapter function: performFiltering.
  **Circumstance**  It may take long to react when the user enters chars swiftly in the AutoCompleteTextView.
  **Problem**  The current implemention of performFiltering may take long to execute. Notice the AutoCompleteTextView processes the inputs and filters the content in a single handler. If the previous filtering procedure is not completed the new filtering procedure would be blocked. For example, if I input 'abc' consequently, the view would process 'a', 'ab' and 'abc' one by one. This may not cause trouble when each word could be processed instantly. But if the process is long outdated processing should be cancelled. 
  **Suggested modification** Design a cancellation mechanism for the Filter. It would be better to cancel the previous processing when new character is input. I would suggest a cancellation mechanism in the while loop of _""suggestLocations""_ function. 

Case 2:
  **Related source code** Class: de.grobox.liberario.fragments.DirectionsFragment function: onCreateView line: query_trips.execute();
  **Circumstance** Slow on querying directions multiple times.
  **Problem** The _execute_ function of AsyncTask would actually execute the multiple tasks in a sequential manner (after Android 3.0 HoneyComb). That means multiple queries would be queued to be executed. The outdated queries should be cancelled to release the pool resource. 
  **Suggested modification** Design a cancellation mechanism of _AsyncQueryTripsTask_ and cancel previous queries when new queries arrive.
