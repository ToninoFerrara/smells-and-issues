rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Dictionaries not downloading from inside app,[],When you try to download a dictionary from inside the app. Nothing happens. 
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Searching for Russian words containing the 'ь' character will often fail,[],"Searching for a Russian word containing the 'ь' character will often fail. Most of the times you end up scrolling down a lot until you find it. For testing, one can search for 'весь', which is in the Russian - English dictionary but not found by searching."
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,closed,Problem searching Thai,[],"We are planning a trip to Thailand, so I downloaded the English-Thai dictionary in this excellent app (thank you for keeping it going!!). I also enabled Thai language as an option in the (built-in) LG Keyboard on my phone (so I can now switch between English, Spanish, and Thai keyboards as I type on the phone).

So, the bug: When I go into the Thai side of the English-Thai dictionary, I find that I can search by the transliteration of words into Roman alphabet only. For instance, if I type ""see"" I get some words matched, such as the transliterated ""see-chom-poo"". But when I switch to the Thai keyboard and type Thai characters, nothing happens in the search -- it doesn't seem to recognize that the Thai characters I have entered match any words.

I was wondering if the Thai keyboard on the phone was the problem, so I went to wikipedia.org in my browser, switched to Thai language there, and verified that I can search Wikipedia in Thai using the Thai keyboard on my phone (not that I can read any of the entries, but the search worked). I also highlighted the first few characters of some random word in an entry I was looking at, and copy/pasted that into QuickDic's search box, but again I got no search results, even when I backspaced it down to just one or two characters. And I even tried copy/pasting some Thai from a Quickdic dictionary entry, and that didn't work in the search box either.

So I think the QuickDic app is not successfully matching Thai characters to characters in the Thai/English dictionary.

I hope that wasn't too much detail... as an open-source software developer myself, I always like to have as much information as possible in bug reports. I'd be happy to test further... thanks!"

rdoeffinger/Dictionary,closed,Round materialish buttons are useless and hide important text underneath,[],"First of all thanks @rdoeffinger for keeping this project alive!

I find that the round materialish buttons you recently introduced in the app are useless and actually hinder usability instead of improving it.

Useless because all their actions were already 0 or 1 clicks away in the old interface:
- **Searching** is the default action when you enter a dictionary. The cursor is automatically in the search box and keyboard is opened. Thus we need zero clicks to get to it. Even if we clicked somewhere else, searching again required only 1 click in the search box, which is a big target that you can easily hit with your fingers.
- **Clearing** the current search word took 1 click in the `X` button to the right of the search box. Again this is a big target that no one misses.
- **Switching languages** also took a single click in the flag, again a big target. This one was somewhat hidden. It is hard for a new user to guess that clicking the flag changes languages. The straightforward solution would be to place (watermark) the two arrows symbol on top of the flag.

Summing up: these new buttons solve no usability issue.

Now, even worse, is the fact that they actually are a usability hindrance, because they hide important text underneath. Checkout what happens in my device:

![quickdic-material-buttons](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1716156/19929022/2edb302a-a0f9-11e6-853d-371e41c666b1.png)

90% of the time we use Quickdic with the keyboard opened. These new buttons take a lot of the precious little space we have left. With them, I am forced to hit the back button to hide the keyboard in order the read the translations. That's something I didn't had to do before. Thus they actually increased the number of clicks for me.

Taking this into consideration, I would urge you to remove these buttons, or at least add a preference's option to do so.


### Tips for future UI improvements

The original UI by Thad Hughes is actually really good. All major actions are easy to do with it. I would exercise caution before adding modifications.

I see that you are in the mood to update it to a full blown Material UI. If so, please consider starting such work in a new branch. Besides avoiding breaking the UI on the production app, a new branch would allow you to start from scratch. It is rarely a good move to work iteratively on top of an old UI design. Better start anew and see whether applying Material solutions to this problem renders a better UI than the original Holo theme."

rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Blue link entries,[],"I don't see the logic or necessity for what I call, in lack of a better term, ""blue link"" entries. With that I mean that some entries' translations are not shown in the list. Instead the are blue and underlined and after tapping it's detailed content is shown. It's nice to have the details but the disadvantage is:
- the translation is not visible at once
- the actual translation (usually the info I am looking for) is hidden in the lower part and only visible after some scrolling
- the entry cannot be exported via ""share"" from the list (exports only the search term). Exporting via select and share in the detail view only exports as one field to AnkiDroid (see #37 )
- the detailed info is not indexed, hence the translation cannot be looked up (e.g. Spanish ""muerte"" = German ""Sterben"". ""Sterben"" is not found (, only the verb ""sterben""=morir).

I am aware that the generation of the dictionary obviously is an automated process and the source data seems to be quite messy given the inconsistent structure of the created dictionary. Still, there must be some attribute of an entry that triggers the creation of such a ""blue link entry"" and I propose to ignore/suppress that.
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Exporting entry to AnkiDroid via share - wrong field assignment,[],"When I export an entry (e.g. ""to set up"") to AnkiDroid via ""Share it"" appears there in two fields, e.g. ""Front"" and ""Back"".

This is good as apparently Quickdic transmits and AnkiDroid recognizes two separate fields (e.g. ""Front"" & ""Back""). [It's not just the first word that is separated from the rest as a test with a two words entry (e.g. ""Costa Rica"") shows. However those entries are always blue link entries and no content is shared.]

However the fields' content is not quite correct as ""Front"" contains only the ""main word"" (""set"") while ""Back"" contains both sides/languages of the actual entry.

Hence I need to do some tedious copying and pasting in AnkiDroid which would be unnecessary if the shared data were assigned correctly.

According to my observations this issue cannot be fixed in AnkiDroid.

I propose to populate the shared data with: ""entry left language SEPARATOR entry right language"".
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Selecting and copying,[],"I'd like to copy a single or a group of words from a translation. Problems are:
- Only single words can be selected
- I can search for the selected word, but when I hit ""copy"" the whole entry (both languages) is copied. (Workaround: search, then copy from search field). This is not the case for the ""main word"" of an entry (under which several entries are grouped). It can be selected and copied as is.
- When I select a word from another entry the 1st remains highlighted, which is certainly not intended or expected.

Accordingly I propose to:
- enable the common text selection in Android (where I have the draggable start and end marker) as in the ""detail view"" of ""blue link entries"".
- add a context menu item ""copy selection"", rename ""copy"" -> ""copy entry""
- fire the deleteSelection method upon selection or whatever is necessary (just guessing wildly here)
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Lookup sporadically not working,[],"In the Japanese-German dictionary I often, not always, experience the following:
- After pasting a kanji (from AnkiDroid) in the search box nothing happens.
- Workaround: switching to German and back, or typing something before the pasted kanji.

Sorry, it's not easily reproducible as it only happens sometimes. Not right now, of course...

EDIT: Also happens in other dictionaries. I just switched to a dictionary after having entered a word. That word was only looked up after typing something. 

This is reproducible with a search term of two words (""give up"") in both English dictionaries (not in FR or ES, though).
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Feature Request: Combined lookup in both languages,[],"To save the hassle of selecting the correct language the app could offer the option to look up in both languages simultaneously.

I realize that this might be a little difficult to implement as the lookup does not work as a filter (where it would be easy to add), but jumps to the first find in the long list. 

Hence, I propose to let it automatically switch the language in case the search term is not found in the active language but in the other one instead.
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,closed,Keyboard display issues,[],"On my device I often find the keyboard behaviour irritating:
- While typing I realize that I am in the wrong language. I switch and the keyboard disappears although I am not done typing. (reproducible)
- On the other hand sometimes the keyboard unnecessarily pops up over dictionary list hiding the dictionaries in the lower part (not reproducible)
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Current Dictionary not identified,[],"I use two dictionaries for the same language because some words can only be found in one, others in the other. So I often switch between the two, without knowing which one is currently active.
- The active dictionary is only identified via the flag, which is obviously the same for both dictionaries. (Not counting the info via ""About dictionary..."")
- In the dictionary list the active dictionary is not highlighted.
- Selecting the active dictionary from the list is not quicker than switching to any other. If it was I'd know that I haven't switched.

I propose to implement any of these (in descending preference):
- fix https://github.com/rdoeffinger/Dictionary/issues/31
- highlight/deactivate/grey out the active dictionary in the dictionary list
- skip the switching process if the active dictionary is selected
- add an info about the current dictionary in the dictionary view
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,open,Feature Request: Combine dictionaries,[],"I have created dictionaries from dict.cc data for English, Russian, French and Spanish as they offer some words and some grammatical information which cannot be found in the standard dictionaries. 

Also, they don't have the annoying ""linked entries"" where you have to click on a blue link and scroll a while to find the translation.

Looking up a rare word can take a while, because I have to switch between dictionaries, without knowing which one is active, before I try Leo, Google Translate or whatever.

I propose to implement an option for merging dictionaries / combined lookup. That could be automatic for all dictionaries of the same language and would thus require only one additional checkbox.
"
rdoeffinger/Dictionary,closed,Issues with Russian dictionary,[],"Using the DE-RU dictionary from 15/DEC/2015 with Quickdict 5.2.6 I noticed the following issues:
- there are polish words, e.g. some declinations of ""Quedlinburg"" and above a couple beginning with ""pł""
- some words cannot be found via look-up although they are present, try ""разме́р"", then look up ""Größe"". Same with мудрость-Weisheit.
- I also saw the German word ""Mythologie"" on the Russian side, but I can't find it again

{{T|en}} could be replace by a little English flag ({{T|...}} mean traduction in ...)
{{trad+|en|coach}} could be replace by 'coach' and maybe it is possible to add a link to this word in an English dictionary 
{{S|...}} is a new section maybe a list with on a different background section title and under section content would be easier to read
