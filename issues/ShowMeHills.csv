ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,30 km. limit...  ShowMeHills... need ShowMeMountains mode,[],"E.g., one can see Mt. Fuji from Tokyo... but with a 30 km. limit, one would never know..."
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,closed,Add Compass lock button,[],Okay I have finally figured out how we can get this app to work properly. I suppose most cell phones compasses do not work when the phone is held up as in taking a picture. The compasses Were Meant to work when the phone is lying flat on a desk. Therefore the procedure should be to First hold the phone flat on a desk until the compass stabilizes then push a lock button. So the interface should add some kind of a lock button. Then the user should slowly raise the phone so he can see the mountains through the camera and then he will thus have the names appear in front of the correct mountains. I apologize for the punctuation in this bug report. I am using Google Talk input.
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open, remember slider positions,[],Please save what the user has set with the two sliders on the bottom of the screen up on exit or the app being killed. Each time I restart the app I have to reset the two sliders to my favorite position so I can see the distance and the height range that I prefer again.
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Must hold phone upside down,[],"This is the only app I know that forces me to turn my cell phone, Android 7.0, totally upside down to use the app. At least a start up screen should say why in the world this is necessary. Why can't it just be like all the other apps and figure out what way I'm holding my cell phone?"
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open, allow user to completely skip calibration,[],"These days often users purchase very good devices that don't need any calibration at all. Once presented with the confusing calibration window upon first starting, the user thanks can I please just get to the meat of the program? Also many users might be in a flat area just testing out the program, or at night time inside their house with no mountains to calibrate against. Anyway the default should just be that calibration is available on the menus if needed, perhaps. Or at least have the cardinal points, all four of them, available during calibration. At least I know where north south east and west are inside my house."
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Showmehills android app not starting,[],"Hello,

I installed ShowMeHills 0.30 from the F-Droid repo on a MotoG3 running CyanogenMod 12.1-20160711-UNOFFICIAL-osprey, Android version 5.1.1. The app seems to install but when I attempt to run it the message 'Unfortunately Show Me Hills has stopped' appears, with an 'OK' button. Clicking on the button removes the message but nothing else appears to happen. I have tried the app on another device (Samsung Tab 2, also running Android 5.1.1) and the same behaviour occurred. Neither of the devices have GAPPS installed. There is an attempt by the app to contact lhr26s02-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.213.174:443) but allowing this through the firewall doesn't make any difference (not sure why it needs the internet?). Having GPS enable/disabled with/without a fix also has no effect. Neither does screen orientation affect the outcome. Any ideas?   The error log is attached:

ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Disable tracking with Analytics,[],"Hello, I would like to request a removal of the tracking from the app.

The main issue is that with this (anti-)feature the most recent version cannot be build and distributed by the F-Droid repository [1].  At the moment version 0.30 is in the repo, but not the newest one (0.31):

```
We can't build this version: analytics

ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Allow manual adjustment of FOV & view direction,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Apparently some phones don't have compasses (!) so as a workaround the FOV and view could be handled manually. This could also be really useful for anyone struggling to get the compass driven FOV & view accurate.

Need to add pinch to adjust FOV, and then swipe to change view direction.
Probably need to have a setting to lock actions down so that it can't happen accidentally.

ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,"Database is large, so need to help out people with small internal storage","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Some phones have really really small storage space for apps. So when we create the database it can be an issue for them - here's a message from a user;

my Galaxy Ace doesn't have much internal memory ... but I do have a 32 mb micro sd card. At present I have to download hills data each time I want to use your app, then delete as soon as used or my phone will be too low on memory. The database takes up 22mb I believe. Is there any chance of either having the data on the sd card by then, or providing download filter option for just UK hills. I guess that would only use 2 mb which would mean I could keep data downloaded.

So, two things todo;
1) see if I can get the database to uncompress to the SD card
2) release a UK only app
"
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Add minimum text size preference,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Depending on the user's eyesight, the distant hills may not be easily readable as the font size is too small (7pt).

We could add a Minimum Font Size preference setting (default 7pt) to enable users to manage this themselves, e.g. some with poor eyesight may prefer both min and max to be 30pt.
"
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,closed,Merge OpenStreetMap peaks not in BIH data and improve display of distant hills,[],"Add instructions for merging OSM with BIH hill data, preferring BIH hill data where there is an overlap based on distance between peaks and BIH hill height + drop. New hills database included brings back most of the local hill data from OSM.

Re #9, increase number of distant hill labels by displaying remaining hills at the minimum label font size. Increase minimum alpha to assist with readability.

Fix #15 by tweaking label display logic and a bit of refactoring. Not perfect but hopefully better!

ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Database being created every time,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","On first start up the database is read from assets and an SQLite db is created. Really this only needs to happen once but currently it's happening every time.

The reason it happens every time is that there were some crashes because the db wasn't being created properly (maybe no room in storage), while the code to check whether it's already created does exist (but isn't used). We need to revive that code and see if it can work robustly.

My compass correction is set to -9° and as I rotate the phone, the AR view status is showing the following:

ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,closed,"Add min distance preference and donut filter, plus minor refactoring","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As discussed, new feature to alllow donut-shaped hills filter:

- Hills are now only added to the `ArrayList` if they meet the new distance criteria. This should speed up the subsequent sort as the min distance increases.
"
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,FOV calibration is poor,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I need to make the method on FOV calibrating more obvious on how to use it and make the actions more easy to use (the way it happens is fine, but it's a bit awkward).

Then it needs a screen showing markers at regular intervals (15 degrees say), and a prompt telling the user that if they turn around then those markers should match the moving landscape, and if the user is seeing that they don't then they have the chance to re-do the FOV calibration (or even +/- tweak buttons)
"
ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,closed,Height data missing from most markers,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I have the data with the heights, but a lot of it is badly formatted (commas instead of decimal points, km,m, or feet, and generally not numerical with lots of odd suffixes).

I've done a lot of the formatting, but need to do a bit more and then import it into the database! Also the British hills db is much more accurate and complete, so need to work on remerging that data into the main db

ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills,open,Very distant mountains (>30 miles away) not showing up,[],"At a vantage point 200 metres high in mid-west Wales we can see snow-capped peaks over 30 miles away but there are so many smaller hills in-between that the faraway peaks don't get a label (in AR mode).

The ""Distance (km): Range of displayed hills"" seems to be more of a ""Show all hills between here and (up to) the specified distance away, preferring closer hills"". I haven't looked at the filter code yet but I'm thinking an additional ""Exclude hills closer than N km"" preference could be added to address this.

Although it's not easy to pick out far away peaks on my phone's display, it would still be a useful feature to guide the eye to pick out which peak is which.
