Changing the name of the file fixes the issue, even if the colon remains in the title metadata. Maybe the application takes the colon to reference an external filesystem? Otherwise filename character escaping might just need to include a colon?

gateship-one/odyssey,open,[Dev proposed] External music source,[],"Hi,

 I'm the developer of [Kutr](https://github.com/X-Ryl669/kutr), and I've started developing a music provider for it on Android. Initially, I'm using [Orpheus](https://github.com/OpenSilk/Orpheus) (which is a nice open source music player) but it's no more maintained. I've just found your project and I think it's a very nice replacement for outdated Orpheus.
I was wondering if you would agree to define a kind of interface so I can plug my provider to this software.

Basically, the [KutrProvider](https://github.com/X-Ryl669/KutrProvider) is an account provider that connects to your personnal Koel or Kutr's server and download the list of songs/albums/artists/folders you have on your server and manage a local cache for the recently played songs (so you don't need to download song each time you play them).

The required interface to connect with this application is thus quite common for any remote music collection server like Spotify or whatever.
1. We need a way to be queried for the list of songs, the relation between songs and album and artists, and, ideally, folders.
2. Then the user would play like usual but when ""consuming"" a remote song, the provider will be queried to give the song's content (either by downloading it or from its cache).
3. Another required function is searching, the provider might be queried for some terms and return a list of matching songs / artists / album / file.


As I understand your code, it would only require minimal changes, if reusing track's URL for specifying the used provider for it (for example, Kutr's based songs would have `kutr://` based paths). It would require adding URL for other models too (defaulting to `local`).
For handling (unknown?) providers, it should not disturb the current application.
Maybe abstracting the `MusicLibraryHelper` to support remote provider would be enough?

The way it's handled in Orpheus is via plugins that are bundled in the application, but it's a bit clunky so any independent solution would be better (maybe using an intent to expect installed providers to answer ?)

In all cases, would you accept such modification, and if yes, would you spend some time defining the interface so I can write the glue code for it and submit a PR ?

But here the target is lighter:

2. Use a network protocol of choice to control Odyssey remotely. If that would be a subset of MP Control Protocol then even beautiful picture arise: Odyssey is enabled to control by local net and M.A.L.P. from another Android can do simple control over it. 3 basic commands would be the 80% of what's desired :)

Bottom line: MPD isn't required, just its network protocol."
gateship-one/odyssey,open,Feature Idea - Filter / Search in playlist,[],"Hello,

A would-be-nice-to-have feature would be a search icon on top of the playlist that when clicked, lets the user enter a string to filter songs. The playlist would only show filtered song, and maybe Odyssey should only play filtered songs.

gateship-one/odyssey,open,Enqueue as next not working properly when random is active - Queue manager?,[],"Hello,

If I understand correctly, ""Enqueue as Next"" just moves the track in the playlist just after the current track.
This is wrong when random is active. The song does not play next as intended.

An easy fix may be to disable the feature when random is active.

Now, a feature that disappears may look confusing and I like this feature anyway, so I guess this is what should be done short term but this would not be ideal for me as a long term solution.

A better fix in my opinion would be to have a queue manager that is separate from the playlist, like in Clementine or Winamp.
I would like to be able to program (queue) next songs and fail back to random when no next songs are programmed. Ability to rearrange the queue would be great too. And I don't like that this feature messes with my playlist, this makes finding songs harder.

This queue might be hidden from the UI as long as the user does not queue songs.
Using a queue manager would change the behavior when random is not active: queuing a song would behave like ""jump to this song after the current one"" instead of ""move this song after the current one"". I have no opinion whether this is better, worse or equivalent. I have never queued songs in non-random mode on any player.  

(Yes, I know, this bug actually looks like a feature request)

Cheers,
Raphaël"
gateship-one/odyssey,closed,"Ensure non empty track titles, failback to filename",[],"Hello,

I just discovered Odyssey and this seems like a Music Player that does what I expect from a Music Player on a phone. Thank you for this nice piece of software!

I have untagged files, and they currently appear blank in the playlist, in the notifications and on the Now Playing screen, which makes Odyssey almost useless for me.

This commit fixes this by failing back to the filename when nothing else is available. I was not sure whether the file extension should be hidden. I decided to keep it, since this gives a hint to the user that their files are not properly tagged and it makes it clear that what is shown is from the name of the file. It also gives more information at no cost (displaying it is not misleading and does not clutter the UI) and requires less code."

However, it doesn't show them under ""Various Artists"", it shows them under one of the artists of the album. So far I noticed that it seems to be the artist of the last track. For example, an album with tracks ""01 - ArtistA - trackA"", ""02 - ArtistB - trackB"", ""03 - ArtistC - trackC"" will be shown under ""ArtistC"" in Odyssey, but the other artists don't show up. I'd expect it to be under ""Various Artists"".

there are many music players on FDroid, but this is one of the few which fit my needs. I have a LOT of music on my device (50G+) and want to have quick access to all the albums without VLC scanning the whole internal storage every time I open the app. I have a few feature requests:

1) Dark / bright color theme selection

Self-explaning I think

2) Manual media scan

I copy my music via SSH as a 7z archive and unpack them with Termux (a terminal emulator). Unfortunately the android media database does not recognize the music files, because the media scanner is not run. This leaves me no other option than using VLC, which has an own media database. 
It would be great to have a button to rescan a specified directory (you'd have to go through the directory and subdirectiories and submit the files for scan)
Like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31685587/trigger-the-rescan-of-mediastore-programatically

3) Nice to have: Display album cover in the notification

Other music players use the album cover as notification 
Like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9252364/album-cover-as-notification

4) Nice to have: mpd integration

Edit: I just saw that you have an mpd client. 
Disclaimer: I know this would require big changes to the app and probably is not what you want. 
Mpd is a very well-engineered software which works with a astronomically large library. Max Kellermann has already ported the daemon to android. It would be an interesting approach to integrate the mpd server into the app so that you can remote control the music, and change the UI to be an mpd client usable with other servers.
