felixb/websms,closed,connector switch as action,[],"c34dd802ca  show connector switch on action bar if multiple connectors

If we are over that limit, then we truncate to the maximum length (minus sig length). The second and third commits add a toast message that is triggered when we do the truncation to inform the user why they can't add more text.
