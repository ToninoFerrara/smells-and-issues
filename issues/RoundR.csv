MohammadAdib/RoundR,open,Suggestion: Autodetect Statusbar Color for Rounding,[],"I was wondering if it'd be possible to auto detect when the statusbar contains coloring so that it may be rounded.  The statusbar is often colored when viewing the desktop, when battery is low, or some apps color it their signature color.  Perhaps grab pixel 0,0 on occasion?

Screen cap included.

MohammadAdib/RoundR,open,Removal of notification with root privileges not working,[],"The foreground notification stays visible on my htc One running Android 4.3 with Sense 5.5 (stock) after trying to remove it with root privileges. The privileges are definitely granted by Superuser so that can't be it. Any other things to try? Thanks a lot.

MohammadAdib/RoundR,open,Unable to blacklist Nexus 5 launcher,[],"The app looks very awkward on the Nexus 5 home screen as it rounds the borders on the content area but the notification and app bars are transparent so it looks as if there are black images rounding off the content area too early.

MohammadAdib/RoundR,open,Get it to merge in Cyanogenmod,[],"Man I have been waiting for this for so long. Thanks for the fantastic app.

Wonder if you could penetrate the system a little bit more so that it is an integrated part of Android, then eventually get it to merge to CyanogenMod.

That'd be super good, as having to run it separately is probably not of a good solution in the long run...

MohammadAdib/RoundR,closed,Added toggle for notification icon and dynamically update slider text,[],"Sorry to be a bother, I added the feature for myself and thought it could be useful in upstream.

MohammadAdib/RoundR,closed,New Notification layout doesn't match normal notification layouts,[],"As seen here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hkrrb4rvpqskqfv/2013-04-18%2010.58.08.png

wouldn't a simple icon like http://i.imgur.com/lP1ArJr.png be enough?

MohammadAdib/RoundR,open,License?,[],"I'd like to be able to distribute this app via f-droid.org, but there needs to be an overall license, like Apachev2 or GPLv3. Also the Notices (if they exist) for Standout should be displayed. Donation links would be welcome: pointing to an XDA Donate link is fine. If publishable releases are git-tagged then that would make updating easy.
