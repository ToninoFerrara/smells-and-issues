Also, when I pin them to top, if I'm not in alphabetic order mode, they still change position depending on the use, and it'd be great to just have them pinned in their position no matter what.

Thanks for the great work, by the way :)

seizonsenryaku/HayaiLauncher,open,Menu position,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","When I tap the physical Menu Button on my phone, the menu appears at the top of the screen, where the three vertical dots are, unlike most Material Design apps where the Menu position is centered at the bottom of the screen in those cases (it still should appear at the top when tapping the three dots, of course). It's quite uncomfortable to reach the other corner of the screen everytime I tap that button.

I'm attaching some examples to be clear qith what I mean. This makes it much more comfortable to use with big screens.

seizonsenryaku/HayaiLauncher,closed,Add FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED when launching activities,[],"This adds the `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED` flag when launching activities, which should be set when starting activities from a launcher app.  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18203278/proper-flags-to-start-an-activity-from-a-launcher

(More detailed explanations: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29321261/what-are-the-differences-between-flag-activity-reset-task-if-needed-and-flag-act )

This PR fixes the following problem where apps will get multiple instances of their activity stacked up when launched from HayaiLauncher (Gmail is a notable example of an app that this happens to):
1. Launch Gmail from HayaiLauncher
2. Return to HayaiLauncher with the Home button
3. Launch Gmail again
4. Press Back
5. You end up on a second Gmail instance, when I would expect to end up on HayaiLauncher

With the PR, HayaiLauncher behaves like other launchers, and no matter how many times you reopen Gmail, there is only a single instance of it's main activity.

This is possibly related to #83 and this may fix or improve the situation described there.
