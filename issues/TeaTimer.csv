ralphleon/TeaTimer,closed,Suggested UI change,[],"Thanks for making this great app open source!

This pull request is just a suggestion, up to you to consider; I've changed the number picker dialog to a gallery dialog so you can just fling through the numbers instead of having to tap repeatedly - much quicker and easier, IMO.  Also added another diddy, which is really just my own preference.

ralphleon/TeaTimer,open,Add system notification as a possible notification sound,[],"This change adds another entry to the list of notification sounds:
System default. When this option is chosen, the Tea Timer will use the
notification ringtone that is currently selected for system
notifications.

ralphleon/TeaTimer,closed,Miscellaneous improvements,[],"Since I use Tea Timer every day, I thought I'd fix some minor issues that bugged me (and some other things I came across on the way). The main changes here are:
1. The repeat rate for the buttons in the number picker (after long press) can now be adjusted in the settings. I noticed that you had already adjusted the hard-coded value twice, but this should take care of it for good. :)
2. The notification will (optionally) be cleared automatically from the status bar after the alarm has sounded. (I tried making the notification completely optional, but there doesn't seem to be a way (on the Galaxy S at least) to make Vibrator.vibrate() use the same vibration intensity as the normal notification vibration.)
3. Support for different screen densities has been added by changing the target API version to 4 (which disables the screen density compatibility mode), changing all px units to dp and fixing the drawing code. Most of the artwork is still scaled up from low-resolution images, except the launcher icon and the number picker buttons, which I happened to find high-resolution versions of.

ralphleon/TeaTimer,closed,French translation / Strings improvements,[],"Hi. It's my first experience there for lots of things : First use of Github, I'm a complete newbie in Android development and not very in development. I took this application as it is, a learning experience.

All strings are now in strings.xml ressource file (as far as I saw). I also added a string file for the French language. The translation is far from being perfect.

ralphleon/TeaTimer,open,Include copy of the GPL,[],"Small thing, but can you include a copy of the GPL in a file called COPYING? That makes it a lot easier for people to redistribute the software.

ralphleon/TeaTimer,open,Notification stays in panel when timer rings while in foreground.,[],"Seems like you shouldn't need to keep the notification around in the panel if the timer activity is in the foreground. This is consistent with the way the Talk and Voice apps work.

ralphleon/TeaTimer,closed,Tea Time doesn't wake up on Android 2.1 / Milestone,[],"I use a long time Tea Time on my Android 2.0.1 without any problems. Now I've upgraded (complete fresh install) my Milestone with Android 2.1 and since then, Tea Time doesn't bell if time is gone.
