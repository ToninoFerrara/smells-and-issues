thasmin/Podax,closed,ergonomy to improve ,[],"Hello, 
In the current version I use (3.5), the icons needed to play the files (play, forward, backward, stop, etc.) are very close to the button 'remove from queue'. 
So it is easy to remove the podcast by error, just by trying to play forward or backward the audio. The button 'remove from queue' should rather be at the bottom of the screen. "

I have the preferences set so that podcasts are not deleted when listened to.

Under normal playback, when the end of a podcast is reached, the next one in the queue starts and the completed one is sent to the end of the queue.

Pressing the far left ""skip back"" button. This only returns the position back to the start of the podcast. Expected behaviour would be one press to go to start of podcase, second press shortly after to skip back one in the playlist.

Pressing the far right ""skip forward"" button. This skips forward to the next podcast in the playlist, but despite preferences, also deletes current podcast even though it may have not been completely listened to. Expected behavior would be to maintain place without deletion and skip forward to the next one in the playlist.

Is this a bug or intended UI feature?

thasmin/Podax,closed,Variable speed playback crash when using auxiliary pause button,"[Label(name=""in progress"")]","Summary: When using variable speed playback greater than 1.0x, podax often crashes on playback resume after pausing using and auxiliary pause button. 

Detail: Symptoms of this bug appear when listening to a podcast at greater than 1.0x speed, pausing the podcast using an auxiliary pause button not directly part of podax's interface (i.e. a pause button on the head phones wire, or pause button on the lock screen, or pause button in the notifications drop-down), then resuming playback will often crash, or podax will be pausing at the wrong place in the podcast. I believe what happens is that podax does not properly track time in the podcast when using variable speed and using an auxiliary pause button; thus when playback resumes, podax thinks the podcast has completed and deletes the file, so on playback there is not more podcast file, then podax crashes.

Test: To test this bug, set variable playback greater than 1.0x, then use an auxiliary pause button, then resume playback. Playback resumes at the wrong point in the file or will crash podax.

"
thasmin/Podax,open,"Numerical specification for  ""Automatic delete"" days",[],"This added feature is something I wanted to suggest for awhile -- so thank you for it a bunch!
But current options (""after listened"", ""7 days"", ""14 days"") is imho not flexible enough.  For some podacsts (news coming out every other day, or  weekly) they make sense, but for some coming out less frequently (e.g. once a month) it would be reasonable to specify 2-3 months.
Altogether this problem could be solved by just allowing to specify number of days to keep as a numeric value (e.g. 7, or 14, or 90 (for 3 months))

Also, would it be sensible to request avoid removing podcasts which were started to listen.  That would be annoying to have some podcast you are in the middle of getting removed.  Might need an additional option for that I guess

I'm a new Podax user, full-time system admin, hobby developer (Web-apps mostly), Android user, Google Listen refugee), and I must say I'm impressed with Podax. I've been trying to bootstrap my Android development platform for a while now and hopefully once I get it working, I'll be able to submit something useful like patches instead of just bug reports / feature requests.

Speaking of which, I would like to add a feature request: The ability to mark individual episodes as listened. Currently when looking at the Podcasts list for a particular feed, unless I already know which one I want, it is extremely annoying to not have a clear indication of which ones have been played and which ones haven't. Please add the ability to persistently mark which episodes have been played and which haven't. This includes automatically marking episodes as played when reaching the end of the recording, as well as an option in the context menu to mark them as read.

This feature is the single biggest problem I've had with Podax while trying to transition over from Listen.

3. Go back to QUEUE screen. Episode is present on the queue, but the display at bottom of screen still shows ""Queue empty"". Even though the episode hasn't been downloaded yet, it is on the queue so should show at the bottom of the screen.
Also whilst testing this I managed to get the download stuck at 0%. Pressing the download button caused the ""Downloading ...etc"" to appear on the notification area, but the episode didn't download and the notification went away.
A little later a background update of subscriptions happened and a second podcast was added to the queue. This successfully downloaded and appear in the now playing area at the bottom of the screen. The original podcast is still first in queue, but hasn't downloaded. Pressing download again still didn't help.
On a slightly different note, I wonder if for bug reporting it would be good to have standard description of different screens and activities so that we all know what we are referring to do. This could be added to the README.md.

thasmin/Podax,open,Headphone contols,[],"Hiya Dan,

I see that the headphone control preference section is gone in 5.x.  That was the bit that let the user determine what happens when headphones (wired or bluetooth) are disconnected.  I see from the code here on git hub that the checks are still there in HeadsetConnectionReceiver.java & BluetoothConnectionReceiver.java

I also see from the commit history where it was removed (c9077e27ae801947d9fb75d4401bb832db752d9b).  The reason that I suggested this in the first place is that the head phone jack on my phone is a bit wonky so the headphones cut in and out if touched.  I know the real solution is to get a new phone but if the problem can be worked around with software I'd like to have the option to do that--at least until the contract is up :)

Sorry if this seems whiny.  Thanks for a great podcatcher.

thasmin/Podax,closed,notification sound interrupts playing podcast (feature request),[],"When a podcast is played and a notification sound for e.g. incoming email is played, the playback stops and starts again 1 or 2 seconds before it stopped. Instead of interrupting the playback, the playback of the podcast could turn down its volume and level it up again after the notification is finished. This is common behavior for music players. 
It's a rather subjective preference, but maybe it would be possible to change the behavior in the settings if the majority of users does not agree to this as the default behavior.

Even if I open podax again and click the back button, in order to close podax the icon is still there. 

Not a big thing, but I suppose the behavior if you click the pause button on the lock screen or inside the app should be the same. And it can be annoying to have the icon there especially when you have a lot of other apps in the notification bar.

This causes quite a problem, as if I don't remember to manually pause it before unplugging it, I have to guess where I should move the marker before I start it back.  Pausing it manually, or having it paused due to a call, or other audio playing seems to work fine.  Thanks.

thasmin/Podax,closed,Add support for headset control of pause/resume,[],"Using com.android.music.MediaButtonIntentReceiver as a starting point,
hook up the headset button for pausing and resuming playback.

By registering the receiver in the manifest with a stupidly high
priority (5000; SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY is supposed to be 1000), we can
prevent Google Music from simply kicking into gear. We should play nice
with other apps, but one step at a time.

In theory, long-pressing the headset button should skip forward, but
isLongPress() appears to never be true at the moment. That, also, can
wait for later; for now, just having the ability to pause & resume is a
win.

thasmin/Podax,closed,Feature Request: Add Flattr support,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","If a podcast feed includes the Flattr information it would be possible to flattr the episode or the podcast via an podcast client directly:
http://developers.flattr.net/feed/

I would break this issue up into two issues:
1. Expose all rel-payment URL's in the UI and support opening these generically in a browser.
2. Detect Flattr URL's and allow users who has authorized Podax to access their account (through OAuth 2) to flattr the Flattr URL from within the Podax UI.

(And a possible third: Allow users to select that flattrable podcast episodes should be automatically flattred when listened to)

Info on how the Flattr OAuth 2 api works can be found here:
http://developers.flattr.net/api/

Info on the Flattr rel-payment links can be found here, as previously mentioned:
http://developers.flattr.net/feed/

Documentation of the resource used to flattr a Flattr rel-payment link can be found here:
http://developers.flattr.net/api/resources/flattrs/#flattr-a-url

Since the Flattr API uses OAuth there's no need for any Flattr credentials to be entered into Podax itself - Podax instead just initializes an OAuth dance and ends up with a token that gives it the permissions to do what it needs with the user's Flattr account - in this case flattring stuff.
