citiususc/calendula,open,"Allow fine-grained control of ""repeat alarms"" settings","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This is a fairly minor issue, but hopefully it is also fairly easy to fix...

After using Calendula for a while, I thought that having the alarm repeat every 20 minutes would work better for me than every 15, so I opened Settings→Notifications→Repeat every [blah], and... nope! I am presented with a short list of pre-defined options, not an input field where I can specify exactly the delay that I want, and no option for ""other"", ""custom"", ""advanced"", or anything.
Also, while I don't currently have any need for more control over the maximum time to keep repeating the alarm, the short list of options for that setting also seems quite arbitrary. Why not just let the user set it to whatever value they want?

### Proposed Solution: ###
Instead of presenting the user with a list of pre-defined options, present either an input field that accepts an integer (with the question phrased as ""how many minutes"") or the Android time picker (with the question phrased as ""how long""). Alternatively, if you think there's some real advantage to the menu of pre-defined time options, add a list entry called ""other"" or ""custom"" that offers the user one of the input fields described above when selected.

As a bonus, it would be nice if the ""dismiss alarms after"" setting offered an ""after x repetitions"" option as an alternative to ""after how long"". Also conspicuously absent is the option for ""never give up, just keep repeating until I address the alarm"" (Although that might want to be refined to ""keep repeating until the next scheduled intake"", to prevent having an indefinite number of active alarms overlapping, while providing an option for relentless stubbornness in which the alarm stays active until either the user acknowledges it or a new alarm takes over.)

Oh, and as a minor wording suggestion, I think something like ""repeat alarm up to"" [x hours | y repetitions | whatever] might be a little clearer and more accurate than ""Dismiss"", especially given that ""dismiss"" has a specific meaning in the context of Android notifications, and the current behaviour of keeping the notification in place and updating its content to reflect a missed dose is not the same as what happens if the user dismisses it."
citiususc/calendula,open,"Make the ""delay this intake"" dialog more flexible (and open-ended?)","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","First, a small suggestion of word choice: as a native English speaker, I think that the use of ""delay"" here is not wrong, but ""postpone"" would be more precise. Also, a small UI design detail: the little clock-face-with-arrow icon that is used in the ""delay this intake"" context and also the ""missed dose"" context should be oriented so that the arrow points counter-clockwise for a missed dose (and any context where the thing we're dealing with is in the past) but clockwise for postponing a dose (and any context where the thing we're dealing with is in the future).

Anyway. My real issue is that the time options available are inadequate. Suppose I'm just arriving at a movie theatre when the notification goes. Now, it's probably going to be 3 hours or more before I get home to take my meds. (Taking a medicine several hours late may be fine, depending on the medicine, of course.)  Currently, I can only postpone the reminder by max 1 hour, at which point the movie is less than halfway over and my phone is put away in silent mode. So as it stands, I gain nothing by delaying the notification, because it'll be showing as a missed dose by the time I get to it anyway.

### Proposed solution: ###
I think that a menu of pre-defined options is a needlessly restrictive tool for this job, and it would be better to use Android's built-in time picker to let the user choose *at what time* the reminder should come up again. (Incidentally, this might also serve to make it more obvious what the difference is between the ""repeat every x min"" option in Settings→Notifications and this interactive ""postpone until"" action.)

If you're concerned about users accidentally postponing a dose way too far, you could define a warn threshold so there will be an ""are you sure?"" dialog if the new time is more than x hours in the future, instead of simply forcing users to choose from a few pre-defined options.
**Note:** If you are going to have a warn threshold and/or an enforced maximum on how long a reminder can be posponed, those values should be made available for the user to change them in Settings."
citiususc/calendula,open,Allow user to acknowledge taking an intake ahead of schedule,"[Label(name=""accepted""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","If a user wants to take their medications *before* the scheduled intake for whatever reason (maybe it's a medicine that has to be taken with food and a meal is ready earlier than usual, or maybe the user is going out somewhere and takes the medicine before leaving rather than having to carry it around...)

Currently, if I scroll ahead in the timeline on the home tab→select an intake→hit the checkmark to acknowledge that I took my meds, the app pops up a dialog telling me that the intake is ""not available"" and that's that. So if I have actually taken the medication early for whatever reason, now I am forced to remember that the upcoming reminder from Calendula is bogus and I should acknowledge it but *not* take my meds.  This is counterproductive, and may lead to accidentally taking the dose twice.

(As a general design principle, I would suggest that you try not to assume that your users are incompetent and need to be restricted to doing things the way you think is right, and put more emphasis on making Calendula flexible so that it can accommodate a wide variety of circumstances.)

Suggested solution:  Similar to what happens when the user hits the ""Take Medicine"" checkmark on a stale notification: pop up a dialog warning the user that this intake is not scheduled to happen for [x hours and y minutes] or some such, and ask whether they really mean to take it now. Have two options to choose from: one for ""No, cancel"" and one for ""Yes, I really am taking this intake now."" Naturally, if the user selects the ""Yes, I really mean it"" option then you need to update the inventory accordingly and also make sure to skip the selected occurrence of that intake reminder when its normally-scheduled time comes."

citiususc/calendula,closed,Proposal to enhance the security measures of calendula app,"[Label(name=""accepted""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","#### Components
The calendula app is personal medication assistant app that help users keep track and effectively manage their prescriptions and drugs use without going through the mental stress of trying to keep it on mind or setting multiple alarms or reminders so as not to miss medications.
As good as the application is, I noticed an important feature that is missing in the privacy settings of the app that is responsible for the users privacy protection of information stored in the app.

#### Proposal
I am proposing that the app request inputting of the current pin in use whenever users are trying to modify/delete or deactivate the pin or fingerprint that is current functioning and being used by the user . And also, the app should request for the pin/fingerprint whenever user is trying to access it even if the app was only minimized after the last use and not totally stopped from running underground as users most times forget to totally shut down an app from running when they are through using it.
While using the app, I found out one of my friends bring up discussion about my health/medication issue which I have stored up in my calendula app which I believed was really secured because my pin and fingerprint security was setup.  But unknowingly for me, the app does not require a pin or fingerprint authentication before it can be accessed if it was only minimized and never totally closed or shut down. This was how my confidential info got out.
Unfortunately, It didn’t stop there as I later found out that my login authentications which include my pin and fingerprint previously set up for the app has been successfully deactivated without my input, this really exposed me to a lot of risk which would be discussed further in the benefits section. 

#### Mockups / Examples

This is an image showing how the current security measure can be easily manipulated by modifying and deleting easily without any form of confirming through user:
This image shows how the modify features currently looks![Screenshot_20180518-130126.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUT7DJJzCPwZhd7qXigx3m2Lkvb5uZutbM4hjRtKB4Vzj/Screenshot_20180518-130126.png)

After clicking on modify, you would be taken straight to this page where you are able to enter entirely new pin without having the knowledge of the current one![Screenshot_20180518-140931.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSj2eEfQHGE6VeyMBuMBAR4iQ7Pg4QvGTKp9Ps4Pb5cSv/Screenshot_20180518-140931.png)

Here is an image showing how the pin can be deleted easily without any forms of confirmation of being the true user![Screenshot_20180518-130139.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPc98Skr7yq7F23xjufZUTCb9X68sUwcexTMhi2UJAxaP/Screenshot_20180518-130139.png)

Here is how the the security measure can be improved which will ensure only authorized users can make security modifications. when the modify button or delete button is clicked, this window will pop up to ensure the user is the authorized to do such by demanding for the current pin![PicsArt_05-18-02.18.50.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQhHCVKT3Cbu2CnaUCwBrnVADuDPp21i97kw2JxnCTHV8/PicsArt_05-18-02.18.50.png)
 If the pin is entered coreectly, here is how the app will look like when the pin is deactivated or pin was deleted![Screenshot_20180518-130150.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZiHHZ5nVwzFrX5N5qB9PNgou8HmF88TcxjVc4qV6Sg2z/Screenshot_20180518-130150.png)

If the pin is entered correctly, then this window will pop up to change to new pin![Screenshot_20180518-140931.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSj2eEfQHGE6VeyMBuMBAR4iQ7Pg4QvGTKp9Ps4Pb5cSv/Screenshot_20180518-140931.png)
#### Benefits
Security is of great importance whose importance can never be overemphasized , so if this proposals is implemented the benefits are much part of which are listed below:
-If authentication is requested for everytime users are trying to access the app (even if the app was only minimized after the last use), this will prevent unauthorized people from getting access to the app and information contained in the app. For instance, currently anybody can access the app if the authorized user only minimized after the last use and didn’t properly close the app.
-If the app request for pin before the current security measures (pin and fingerprint) already set up by the authorized users are modified/deactivated, this will be of great benefits as apart from confidential medical info getting leaked, it will prevent a total hijacking of the authorized user account. How you may ask, the original authorized user can lose access over the control of the log in if the intruder decide to delete the original user security authentications  and set up his/her pin instead and there is no other way to recover such password.

Medical information are really confidential and its even a crime in most nations if it was disclosed to unauthorized people by medical practioners , so I believe this proposal should be implemented as soon as possible.
Thanks."

Also suppose I take a handful of vitamins and supplements that all follow the exact same schedule, eg a dose at breakfast and a dose at supper every day.

I add listings for all the medications, which proves to be unexpectedly tedious because for every entry, I'm forced to scroll through all the ""near-match"" database suggestions before I can add the medication exactly as entered, as described in issue #113 . After a detour to the settings menu to disable the database, (see issue #114 ), it gets much easier to add the rest of my medications.

I add routines for breakfast and supper, which proves complicated and frustrating as described in issue #112 , but okay. I work around that and get my routines added.

Then I start to create my first schedule, thinking that I will select the five relevant items from my list of medications and then the app will present me with a dialog where I can give the Schedule a name and enter all five dosages and then hit Save, but no! What should be one entry process resulting in one Schedule item for ""all the pills I take with breakfast and supper every day"" must instead be painfully entered as five individual-but-identical schedules, going through the exact same steps five times. (Ten times when you factor in the ""weekday breakfast"" and ""weekend breakfast"" workaround per issue #112 ).  Once I get through that process, there seems to be no way to consolidate, group, rename, or sort the 10 or 15 resulting entries in the Schedules list, which is such an unreadable mess of nearly-identical entries that I'm not likely to spot an error except by setting alarms to remind me to check whether my Calendula alerts are coming up when they're supposed to.

This is a major frustration, and given that the user is presented with a checklist of medications that totally *looks* like you can select as many as you want--but the app unexpectedly leaps into a screen forcing you to specify the dosage and Routine for only one medication at a time as soon as you tap one, and bizarrely limits you to only one medication in any given Schedule...

I do not want my medication alarm going off at 06:30 on weekend mornings when I'm still asleep, reminding me to take medications that are perfectly fine to take at 09:30.

The solution: allow the user to apply a time offset to any given routine on certain days of the week, so when we create a routine such as ""breakfast"" and its associated time of day, such as 06:30, we could then check a ticky-box for ""apply time offset some days of the week?""...

Maybe throw a warning if the offset pushes the routine up to or past a routine that already exists on those days.

Right now, I'm using a crude workaround where medications that I take with breakfast every day are listed in a Mon-Fri schedule with a ""weekday breakfast"" routine and then listed again in a Sat-Sun schedule with ""weekend breakfast"" routine (but then if it's a twice-a-day med, supper time is the same all seven days, so do I need to have two identical routines for weekday supper and weekend supper at the same time of day to avoid getting duplicate entries in the supper routine from my twice-a-day meds that reference ""weekday breakfast"" and ""supper"" in one schedule and then reference ""weekend breakfast"" and ""supper"" in a second schedule?) Either way, this workaround is ugly and results in having two or three entries per medication in the list of schedules, thus making the schedule view essentially useless--especially if the issue affects several medications a user is taking."

citiususc/calendula,closed,Incompatible SDK API use which may cause crash to your APP,[],"Hi Calendula Developers,
I develop a tool to detect incompatible SDK API use in android application. Today I use my tool to check Calendula downloaded from F-Droid. My tool report many bugs. Although I believe most of them are real bugs, I cannot be 100% sure because I am not very familiar with Android developing. So
please help to check it, it must be very helpful to your APP.

The attachment below is the bug report that my tool give. please help to double check!
I also really hope to get your feedback.
thank you!

**[Supplementary explanation]**
There are totally two type of bug in the report. The first one is like this: ""API called in method not in [list]"", the list here are sdk levels, it means your app run under these SDK version can not call API because no such API in these sdk levels.
Type two is like ""API called in method no living level"", it means your application can never reach this API
use, so if these API uses are not in external library, you can remove it from your own code.

APIs or methods in our report are given in signature format like ""<declaringType: returnType methodName(paramTypeList)>"".

And finally, the reachable path is actually one possible call stack. it is always start from dummyMainMethod which is created by our tool. So you should read it from bottom to top.

Yes, many of these bugs seem to be in third-library codes. But it do cause problems in your app. Some third-library API say that they can only be run at specific SDK Level by using ""@targetapi(Build.VERSION_CODES.N)"", however, Application codes tend to ignore this warning.

3. Create hourly schedule for Med2 with 13:15 as the start date.

##(2) Both notifications are shown, but the second one is automatically dismissed.##

Create routine schedule for Med2 with 13:15 as one of the dates.

Tap on the notification for Med1.
In Calendula, tap the checkmark indicating you have taken Med1.
Press either the arrow in the upper left, or the Android back button.

**(2) Expected Behaviour**
You should now be presented with the second Calendula screen for Med2, in order to tap the checkmark, indicating you have taken Med2. The notification for Med2 should still be there.

citiususc/calendula,closed,WIP: Use exact alarm scheduling for API versions >= 19,[],"Fixes #52 

Tested for two days on my device (CM13, Android 6.0.1), alarm times are exact with these changes. No errors were observed, but I could not yet test on older devices. Also, no significant battery usage increase happened.
Looking forward to your testing and feedback.
"
citiususc/calendula,closed,Alarm time is inexact for API versions => 19,[],"> Note: Beginning with API 19 (KITKAT) alarm delivery is inexact: the OS will shift alarms in order to minimize wakeups and battery use. There are new APIs to support applications which need strict delivery guarantees; see setWindow(int, long, long, PendingIntent) and setExact(int, long, PendingIntent). Applications whose targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will continue to see the previous behavior in which all alarms are delivered exactly when requested. 

([Source](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html))

For my device (running CM13, Android 6.0.1) the alarm times are very unreliable - sometimes more than an hour off. Since this application is supposed to help with medication intake times, I think reliable alarm times should be a critical priority in regards to battery usage - at least as important as your daily wake-up alarm. There are certain medications where even half an hour makes a large difference for the affected patients condition.

Since `setExact` only exists on API versions >= 19, conditional branching based on `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` could be needed if support for older API versions must not be dropped.
