adrian-bl/bl-battstatus-android,open,Android 5.0: problem with notification on lock screen,[],"Hi,

Android 5.0 shows notification on the lock screen, so Battery Circle always appears there. That has following problems:
1. it's not suppoesed, that the lock screen is cluttered with an app, that actually does not show a notification
2. the shown battery value is wrong (outdated?). E.g. it shows 94 % at the moment, while actual value is 75 %.

It never happened for a whole month with android 4.4.
