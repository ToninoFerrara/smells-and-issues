koelleChristian/trickytripper,open,"add ""weight"" to travelers","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","There is a feature missing that was a problem during my last calculation. We had a group of ""person groups"", meaning 4 Families, some with 3 children, some without. Children are not paying, and partners share the same purse, so I created a ""traveler"" for each family. We wanted to split the money in a ""fair"" way, so that a family with more ""eaters"" (=children) pays more than a family with just two adults.

In my understanding, I would say, I needed a ""weight"" per traveler (=persons in this calculation group) that mirrors the relative payment. A family with 2 parents and 3 children would have ""weight"" 5, a single person would have ""weight"" 1 - and the couple without children would have ""weight"" 2 - the payments should then be split according to this weight: 5:1:2.

This would be a big improvement IMHO to this (already excellent) software. The weight could be a property of a traveler, when creating it, and changed later, let's say, because the group decides that one child in a traveler subgroup is so small that it does not count - so decreasing the weight should update the splitting accordingly, automatically."

   Explanation for issues of type ""ExtraTranslation"":
   If a string appears in a specific language translation file, but there is
   no corresponding string in the default locale, then this string is probably
   unused. (It's technically possible that your application is only intended
   to run in a specific locale, but it's still a good idea to provide a
   fallback.).

   Note that these strings can lead to crashes if the string is looked up on
   any locale not providing a translation, so it's important to clean them

koelleChristian/trickytripper,open,Split evenly is reinterpreted as Custom split,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","When reviewing payments in TrickyTripper 1.5.5 from F-Droid, I noticed that, while I entered them as _Split evenly_ in the edit they appear as _Custom split_ with an equal amount. I think that is confusing and makes to check if the amounts are equal and whether I had entered some error inadvertently.
I can understand that, when splitting an odd number between two people, a _Split even_ is converted to a _Custom split_ with one traveller taking the remainder, but it should be avoided if the amounts are equal.

_field1_

GBP Rate EUR
`<<`
_field2_

_field3_

I doubted and finally wrote 0,8667 in the _field2_ which is the right place. But I was confused by the >> << characters.
Maybe a better interface is:

`=`
_field2_  EUR

_field3_

koelleChristian/trickytripper,open,Decimal separator in CSV export,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello, I used Tricky Tripper 1.5.5 from F-Droid in my last trip and had some nuisance that you may want to look on.
I exported the report to CSV and sent it through GMail. I am using a Spanish locale so the export uses comma , a as a decimal separator and tabs as cell separators.
From the GMail web site, I noticed that the GMail preview split the cell as if comma were the cell separator instead of tabs. When opened in Google Spreadsheet, it is still misinterpreted as if comma were the cell separator. Downloading and opening in LibreOffice allows me to choose the decimal and cell separators, so there is no problem.
So it is not a big nuisance and more a lack of features on Google's part, but maybe you want to rethink the export format. I understand that the Android interface rules disapprove cluttering the interface with many options so maybe the tradeoffs are against letting users to choose.
In any case, thanks for the program and for making it open source.
