lkorth/screen-notifications,closed,Permission <READ_PHONE_STATE> is declared but not used,[],"Hello, I'm Denis Bogdanas, a research assistant at Oregon Stat University.
I'm working on a tool that automatically introduces runtime permission checks and requests for Android 6 apps. As part of this study I analyzed this app. I was looking at the way permissions are referred in the code.

This app declares permission <READ_PHONE_STATE> in the apk manifest, but doesn't have any code that requires them. It is possible that source code doesn't declare the permissions. I only analyzed apk builds from f-droid. Yet android build mechanism may introduce them when the app uses certain libraries:

https://commonsware.com/blog/2015/06/25/hey-where-did-these-permissions-come-from.html

It won't create any problems on Android 6, but on Android 5- users may wonder why the app needs these permissions and be skeptical of installing the app.

Do you think this is an issue?

best regards,
Denis

lkorth/screen-notifications,open,Use accelerometer and other fixes,[],"Mainly i wanted to use the accelerometer, so that i can have e.g. my phone on my desk; a notification comes in and then only if i lift it up, the screen goes on. I don't have any lookscreen or so, so i usually also have the option on to scroll down the statusbar.

But then i also updated the gradle tool builds etc. and had problems that the service didn't started on Android M(N5, 6.0.1r3). Therefore i added a binder to the service and manually invoked it. Even then sometimes the user needs to restart the device(added that as a hint to the preferences).

Next thing was to have an option to test the whole app. This is also nice for a user, so i added this option to the settingsfragment.

Lastly i wanted to avoid that the whole service fires, when the screen is already on (if the status bar scroll is on this can lead to some weird behaviour a la ""ups why did my statusbar scrolled down?!"")
