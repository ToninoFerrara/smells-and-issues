I've tried a number of times and eventually gave up; This is completely counter productive and nonsense in my opinion. You waste the time of people that want to help, and you waste material that could be added to those people when they give up.

* Why is not the forum open to edit for anyone?

* Can you please give everyone edit permission?

* Can you at least add an email that can be used to request editing permission on the wiki; eg create admin@wiki.tripsit.me and add it to the [login](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Special:UserLogin) page?"

TripSit/tripmobile,closed,Combo fix,[],"Major changes are
- removed .idea folder - this is generated by Gradle when opening the project for the first time
- added a CombinationActivity which uses the tripbot api rather than the combos.json object
- a new combination category (caution) will need adding to separate translation documents
- changed some style parents to use appcompat styles - themes unaffected
- changed activity parents to use appcompat activity - brings in bugfixes for older platforms

TripSit/tripmobile,open,Download and cache all factsheet info upon load ,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Instead of caching each individual search, we can download all of the factsheet info in one go (maybe in an AsyncTask on app load) and cache that instead. The only issue this would cause is we then need to find a way to parse the aliases ourselves, but that shouldn't be too hard. I guess it would all be loaded into a Map where different keys point to the same object.

TripSit/tripmobile,closed,Factsheets error handling doesn't work,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","To reproduce, type any invalid drug name into the factsheets search. This is happening because we're not allowed to show error messages from a background thread (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3875184/cant-create-handler-inside-thread-that-has-not-called-looper-prepare)

I suggest using a callback in `Factsheets` to use the `handleGenericError(String)` method it inherits from `ErrorHandlingActivity`

TripSit/tripmobile,open,Feature request - Fun & Games,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I think it would be good to include some fun activities for people to play about with when they are on various drugs. Some examples of this could be images to flick through on psychedelics, music to listen to on dissos, or some drawing tools.

Examples of websites/apps we could try and integrate, imitate or link to (depending on copyright):
http://weavesilk.com/
http://beautifulfuckingshit.tumblr.com/
http://radio.tripsit.me/

It also needs to have links to the combos and factsheets data to say where we get that from.

We can also add links to the website and information about donating. It would be a good idea to include some contact info (assumedly jimmycarr@tripsit.me or we can make android@tripsit.me) for people to send in bug reports and feature requests. We might even be able to integrate this with someone's gmail account within the app to send the email directly from the app.

TripSit/tripmobile,closed,Implement themes,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","We require at least a light and dark theme, with the possibility of having more in the future. The following changes should be made to allow for this:

- [x] Allow users to select a theme from the settings page
- [x] Create icons, buttons and other images such as ExpandableListView
- [x] Define all colours to be used in the colors.xml file and allow the different themes' styles to use them.
