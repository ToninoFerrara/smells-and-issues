jerickson314/sdscanner,open,translation strings too rigid,[],"I just created a german translation (PR will come). It tourned out a little difficult, because the way the translation strings are used is a little unflexible. For example, in english, one says `Examined /storage/emulated/0/foo/bar`, while a proper german sentence would be something like `/storage/emulated/0/foo/bar examined`.
It would be cool if you could change the usage from

```
R.string.something + ' ' + filename
<string name=""something"">Examined</string>
```

to

```
String.format(R.string.something, filename)
<string name=""something"">Examined %1$s</string>
```

I hope it is clear what I mean.
(Of course this should not only be changed at that ""examined"" place, but everywhere other text is going to be added.)

jerickson314/sdscanner,open,Warning if .nomedia exists in the root folder and aborting the scan,[],"It took quite some time to realize that SD Scanner didn't work for me just because of a .nomedia file got planted somehow into the root of the sdcard.
This pull request contains code that will look for a .nomedia in the root of the given path, and if found, will both issue a message and abort the scan (which won't yield any results anyway).

If you accept this pull request, feel free to adjust the message text, which should probably be translated to the other supported languages.

Cheers.

(*) The better solution would be to introduce the ability to remove this /sdcard/.nomedia file with a click of a button, but this will require adding the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. So I leave it up to you.

jerickson314/sdscanner,open,doubled pictures due to symlinks,[],"it seems sd scanner doubles all pictures which are also avaiable via symlink.

i found this setup on my device:

 /storage/emulated

 /sdcard -> /storage/emulated/legacy

i scann from /storage to scann emulated and real sd card. after that most pictures (and dirs) are doubled. i assume the symlink /storage/sdcard0 is not disregarded by sd scanner as it should be.

anyway i wonderful & usefull app because if often push images via adb! thank you!

jerickson314/sdscanner,open,Direct Access to External SD card (new feature),[],"SD scanner always opens up pointing to /storage/emulated/0.  Phones with a physically external SD card also have /storage/extSdCard.  (Lots of Android/manufacture/upgrade history over the definition of SDcard -- is it physical or logical... TL;DR).

Anyway, it would be nice for SD Scanner to have an easy way to direct the scan to \storage\extSdCard\,, as opposed to having to carefully edit (capitalization counts!) the path before starting the scan.

PS: When I first opened the app, I saw what is the ""refresh arrow"", and assumed it was ""browse for folder"".  Couldn't figure out why it didn't do anything until I was in the middle of editing the path and accidentally brushed it.

jerickson314/sdscanner,closed,Allow option to skip examining existing entries,[],"For some reason, whenever I scan a directory, e.g. /storage/external_SD, after the examination phase, the app keeps processing files under /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.

I suspect that this is due to the app not having permission to access files under /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/, hence assuming they are removed and being processed.

I have millions of small picture files and the processing phase takes hours every time, so I often have to leave it on overnight. The process could definitely be sped up if it avoided reprocessing directories where I know there do not exist photos.

Maybe there could be an option to skip examining existing entries, and/or only process update/deleted files under the specified directory?

Anyhow, the app is great!  Saves me from the frustrating unreliable alternative of repeatedly plugging in and out my SD card and rebooting. Ugh.

jerickson314/sdscanner,open,Tasker plugin (feature request),[],"Hi @jerickson314 .

First: thanks for sdscanner, it's the best (only) rescanner I've found for KitKat.

Here's a big ask:  Any chance of a Tasker plugin?

In particular, with a Tasker plugin, you could trigger rescans programatically, either based on time or based on events.

Second best: export a ""rescan now"" broadcast intent receiver.  That's probably easier and could be called from Tasker.

Once again, thanks for your efforts!
