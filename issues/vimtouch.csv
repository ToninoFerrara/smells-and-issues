momodalo/vimtouch,closed,Remap Caps Lock from analog keyboard?,[],"I'm using VimTouch on an HTC One smartphone. I use a Mac bluetooth keyboard so I can type and edit text files at pretty much the same speed as on my computer when I need to. On my computer I always remap Caps Lock to send an Escape signal, which makes mode shifting so much faster because Caps lock is so close to the home row.

This remapping is a little problematic, even on a PC, because Caps lock doesn't handle input like other keys. I've accomplished it on Windows with AutoHotkey and on Linux with a custom Xmodmap file.

But it gets worse, because now my muscle memory is to hit caps lock when I want to exit insert mode. In VimTouch, this inevitably enables caps lock and causes all sorts of problems due to momentary confusion.

So I don't know if this is the right place to ask (the solution may be beyond the scope of VimTouch), but is there a way I can remap Caps Lock on my analog keyboard while connected to my phone? I would really prefer not to need to maintain two distinct muscle memories (one for Vim editing on my phone, and one for Vim editing on my PC, which allows me to use Caps Lock for escape).

Being an avid user of vi (actually: [Evil](https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home)) I am now making more and more use of VimTouch on my Android mobile phone, and phasing out the Notes app.

As I'm not carrying a keyboard while I'm on the move, I rely on the phone's own input methods. There is IMHO no alternative to character-based input in normal mode (and in command mode and in visual mode). However in insert mode I often prefer word-based input, as it allows input by swiping over the virtual keyboard, and as it provides auto-completion. Therefore **I would appreciate being able to define the VimTouch input mode separately at least for insert mode**. Additionally it might help if it were possible to switch the input mode more easily than by going to Preferences. E.g. with a quick button.

I was trying to update your app on F-Droid from 2.3 to 2.6, and I came across a few issues:
- No AndroidManifest.xml. It is fine if you want to move them at build time, but we use them to check for updates and check for source code integrity (correct package id, etc). Could you please supply a base AndroidManifest.xml file with the basic info? (I know you put the version data in project.properties, but that's just your format and we really can't adapt to every single specific case). We can work without an update check for your app, but then it might be some time until we notice there had been an update for months (like it is now with 2.3 -> 2.6).
- You request for ANDROID_SDK_HOME and ANDROID_NDK_ROOT to be declared to run your script. Which is fine, but I'd rather use ANDROID_HOME for the SDK and ANDROID_NDK for the NDK. These are the standards and most systems already have them declared by default.

I use Vimwiki, a personal wiki built on top of Vim, and it requires Vim to be compiled with conceal support. It looks like Vim Touch isn't built with +conceal (though I can't get a vim --version so I can't say for sure).

If this could be tweaked, that would be awesome.

Thanks!

Or am I missing something about vim touch?

Installation Instructions

Step 1 of 4: Download and extract the archives

Extract one of the archives above into your ~/vimfiles directory (if you are using windows) or ~/.vim directory (if you are using *nix).
If you are updating after a long time, it might be a good idea to remove the ~/vimfiles/ftplugin/latex-suite directory from previous installations before reinstalling.

NOTE: If you already have some latex ftplugin files, read the Advanced Installation Instructions to make sure you do not over-write any of your files.

Step 2 of 4: Set a few things in .vimrc

The recommended settings for vim-latex in your .vimrc file are now only described in the vim-latex manual.
Step 3 of 4: Install the help files

To install the included latex-suite.txt and latexhelp.txt files as vim help files, start vim and do the following:
helptags ~/.vim/doc     (for *nix users) 
helptags ~/vimfiles/doc     (for windows users) 
Step 4 of 4: Done!

Thats it! You are done! Now start editing a latex file in vim. Latex-Suite should start up automatically. You can do

:help latex-suite.txt
from within vim to get the online Latex-Suite reference.
