I have dig into the crash log, and found that this is a bug of `MPAndroidChart`. The method `getClosestStackIndex` of `com.github.mikephil.charting.highlight.BarHighlighter.java` in `MPAndroidChart` with version `v2.1.3`, doesn't process the occasion that the length of input parameter `range` is `0`. And then I viewed the current code in `MPAndroidChart`, and found they have fixed this bug two years ago. Maybe upgrade `MPAndroidChart` can fix this bug.
 
Oh, upgrading dependency directly will cause building error, because of the API changing.

Thanks."
codinguser/gnucash-android,open,Feature request: Disable gnucash numpad,[],"#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
Do something that pulls up the custom gnucash numpad (say, add a transaction, and click the amount box)

#### Expected behaviour
The gnucash onscreen numpad doesnt pop up, allowing me to type in a number with my physical keypad, which should also be autoset to number input mode.

#### Actual behaviour
The gnucash custom numpad appears, taking up half the screen. When i try to enter numbers on the physical numpad (i use a galaxy folder 2, one of the few android flipphones), it defaults to text-input, causing me to have to switch input mode.

The suggested solution would be a switch in the settings disabling the custom numpad, and if toggled, instead when you click a number box, just telling the android keyboard to pull up a number input (and not pulling up the gnucash one), which should allow us few smart-flipphone (or blackberry, i guess) users to use our keypads.

When I scheduled the repeat transactions on the to-post transaction (of yesterday), the date that appeared in the repeated transactions is two weeks (which I set) today (not yesterday).

When I tried to change the posted transaction to correct the error, Android GnuCash crashed. It isn't obvious what is crashing, no error message, but the delay/hang before crashing makes me think it's failing to post to the database through a conflict.

BTW I don't think I should really be posting the reoccurring transactions in Android. Probably better on the desktop version. Depends whether the delete after export function deletes the transaction scheduler/repeater."

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,QIF export crashes due to illegal denominator,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","GnuCash Android crashes a few seconds after starting to export my transactions to a QIF file, either local or in Dropbox. File is created, but empty. I've been exporting my mobile transactions to desktop app this way for a long time, and it had worked last time with the same database.

I've checked Android logs with CatLog and found this error message:

01-18 09:59:44.314 W/System.err(23088): org.gnucash.android.export.Exporter$ExporterException: Failed to generate export with parameters: Export all transactions created since 2017-11-22 01:36:43.359 UTC as QIF to DROPBOX - split quantity has illegal denominator: 1000000

I've searched Google for this error message, and found source code (QifExporter.java) that throws it if a split has the QUANTITY_DENOM column set to an unsupported value. It seems that allowed values are only 10, 100 or 1000.

Then I've opened the current book's database file with SQLite and ran a query to find out which transactions had the unsupported 1.000.000 value as QUANTITY_DENOM, and found a few of them, as shown in the attached screenshot. These were transactions created with GnuCash Desktop and imported to GnuCash Android 2 months ago, with a recent beta version of the mobile app (not sure which of them).

After deleting those few transactions (didn't try to fix them in the database, as they're already in GnuCash Desktop), export works fine.

I don't know GnuCash internals to tell if setting the denominator column to 1.000.000 was a mistake of the desktop or the mobile app, but I believe it should be properly handled at export time.

Edit any simple transaction (just two acounts) without decimals. You won't be able to insert a decimal comma (or a decimal point) in the amount.

#### Expected behaviour
You should be able to add decimals when editing the transaction amount.

#### Actual behaviour
As a workaround, you have to select the ""split transaction"" button to be able to add them.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Cannot export to non-ZIP format,[],"#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
1. <!-- List the detail steps to reproduce the problem here -->
Export a file.

#### Expected behaviour
Exports would remain unzipped and be in the file format that the users selects for the export (like .qif)
While it may make sense for certain users that the export files be zipped to save on bandwidth, it doesn't make sense for all. In fact, most US users would rather not have to unzip the export files in order to import them into native gnucash.

Additionally, for some exports, the ZIP file is LARGER than the unzipped one. 

At least provide the end user the option as to whether the export files are zipped or not.

#### Actual behaviour
All exports are zipped and the user can't change that in the settings

1. Set ""Default Transaction Type"" to ""CREDIT"" (under ""Settings"" > ""Transactions"" > ""Default Transaction Type"")

2. Create new transaction from Account ""Assets:Current Assets:Cash in Wallet""
Description = ""Test 1"" 
Amount = ""0.01""
Direction ""Spend"" (set automatically)
Account  ""Expenses:Auto""
3. Save transaction
4. Check the total amount for Account ""Cash in Wallet"" = -0.01 (ð)

5. Create new transaction from Account ""Assets:Current Assets:Cash in Wallet""
Description = ""Test 2"" 
Amount = ""0.02""
Direction ""Spend"" (set automatically)
Account  ""Assets:Current Assets:Saving Account""
6. Save transaction
7. Now you see two transactions in Account ""Cash in Wallet"": -0.02â¬ and -0.01â¬.

8. Check the total amount for Account ""Cash in Wallet"" = -0.03â¬ (ð)

9. Now change the Account in the transaction ""Test 2"" 
Change Account: ""Assets:Current Assets:Cash in Wallet"" => ""Expenses:Auto""
10. Save transaction 
11. You still see two transactions in Account ""Cash in Wallet"": -0.02â¬ and -0.01â¬. (ð)

12. If you check the total amount for Account ""Cash in Wallet"", you will see **+0.01â¬**! (â).

codinguser/gnucash-android,open,Feature Request: Choosing the Account on the New Transaction screen,[],"I find the current way of quick-entering new transactions quite cumbersome. Correct me if I'm wrong, please.
It seems that the quickest way to enter a transaction is to create a widget and then tap the plus sign, fill in the details and tap Save. However, this only works for one account. Entering transactions for 2 or 3 accounts becomes heavy on home screen realestate as multiple widgets are needed to accomplish the same thing for multiple accounts.
It would be great if we could choose the source account on the New Transaction screen. 
This way, only one widget would be enough to enter new transactions for any account in the book.

In addition, I would really appreciate if the widget would scale correctly when resized onto 1x1 square. This is more than enough to display the balance of the selected account and a '+' sign for entering new transactions. Takes the same amount of space as an icon but serves multiple purposes.

The ""from"" account list might be made useful if it would filter only the Favorite accounts, as well. Then, entering new transactions (i.e. right after shopping) would be a breeze. If it is cumbersome, nobody will bother to enter expenses, which defeats the purpose of actively using Personal Finance app and budgeting.

For an example of the described functionality, you can have a look at MoneyManagerEx for Android app and source code. 

This goes hand-in-hand with #110, which would allow quick selection of the destination account. "
codinguser/gnucash-android,open,Feature Request: Database Sync,[],"So far, people have been mostly asking about synchronizing their mobile database to desktop. Which is the most common need for any GnuCash user, naturally.

Here I would like to have synchronization between different Android devices. Meaning uploading the whole database to a cloud service and using it at another device.

Again, this is something I've worked on before (in MMEX) and would be happy to share any insights. The code is also available at [MMEX 4 Android](https://github.com/moneymanagerex/android-money-manager-ex) repository for anyone to have a look at the implementation.
Using a built-in sync service would be my preference, instead of having a custom scheduled task. And this also seems to be the direction in which Android 8 APIs are moving, it seems.

Any thoughts?"
codinguser/gnucash-android,open,Feature Request: Asset Allocation,[],"The main obstacle to using GnuCash for Android (or GnuCash in general) for me would be inability to maintain asset allocation for investment accounts.
I am wondering if you would be open to implementing such a module in the Android version even though there is no such thing in the desktop application.
Since I implemented the same functionality in MoneyManagerEx for Android, I'd be willing to contribute code, if you agree. 

I would not go too much into conceptual explanation as much has been written about asset allocation. Essentially, different investment types would be assigned an asset class. Each class would be assigned a percentage of the portfolio total amount. 
Then, over time, as asset prices change, this allocation would go off balance due to price oscillations. Having ability to see the current allocation and offset from the pre-set allocation is crucial.
I'm happy to answer any questions or comments and am looking forward to them."

Hi, I've implemented hourly scheduled actions, and tested them to work by creating an hourly Dropbox export. There are three notes, however:
a) I've not implemented changes related to Budgets. Unfortunately some of these methods were difficult to understand with my limited GnuCash experience. I believe this feature is not production-ready yet? I've marked all spots where code needs to be filled in with the comment TODO:HOUR.
b) I changed the AlarmManager interval for ScheduledActionService from HALF_DAY to HALF_HOUR, i.e. form half the old minimum unit to half the new minimum unit. I hope this does not impact battery drain, etc.

[USER REPORT] I am seeing consistent crashing during export to Google Drive. I tried my first export in about 6 months. It was the first time since different currencies exported to different files (in case this is related). I was trying to export to Google Drive (using ""Share..."" and selecting Google Drive). Oddly, it isn't GnuCash crashing, it is the Google Drive app crashing. But it crashes immediately after I select a folder, and the files are not uploaded. I have never seen Google Drive crash under any other circumstances.
I tried about 5 times, and it failed consistently each time. I tried the same thing on my wife's phone and got the exact same crashing results. (Her phone is a more standard Android setup than mine.) But exporting to SD card and then doing a Google Drive upload from the file manager worked without issue.

codinguser/gnucash-android,open,Feature Request : Custom Quick Purchase Menu,[],"Idea for a new useful convenience feature in the GNUCash Android App : Shortcut menu for purchasing options users can set-up themselves.

Enter the new transaction window, have a button for ""Quick Transaction"" - loads page with a list of companies/establishments you routinely go to, sub-menu of common item you usually purchase (for instance drinks at your local establishments or set meals).

Having this would be helpful in quite a few ways:

1) Saves time entering the transaction for regular entries multiple times a day in common locations

2) Helps keep all those transactions entered the same way as you initially entered them so less sync issues.

3) From the new transaction window you click 2 entries on a shortlist (most commonly used / alphabetical) to enter the purchase made at the time. (Saves the amount & Transaction type)

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Bugfix 617: Weekly scheduled exports are listed with the wrong day,[],"Fixes #617 

There some are important changes, so I thought you might want to review it.

Instead of storing the days of the week as a string (""MO;TH"") in `mByDay`, which is painful to work with, I've changed it to store as a List of Calendar constants (`Calendar.MONDAY`) instead. If later we want to support specific days in the month, we can just change the list type to some other class to hold the new information.

As this was meant for hotfix/patches, I haven't changed the database structure but, in my opinion, we should think of storing `recurrence_byday` in a separate table. Apart from not conforming with the first normal form, the parsing of the column (`RecurrenceDbAdapter.{byDaysToString,stringToByDays}` ) makes it awkward to work with."

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Widgets stop functioning after changing book,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
1. Create two books.
2. With `Book 1` active, create a widget looking at any account in `Book 1`
3. Open `Book 2` (making it active), then restart your device
4. Observe that the widget created in step 2 no longer displays the selected account
#### Expected behaviour

The widget continues to display the account it was created with.
#### Actual behaviour

The widget displays ""Account name"" and one button which does nothing (there are two buttons if this is done on the `develop` branch). Clicking on the widget also does nothing.

If you re-open `Book 1` and restart your device the widget will return to displaying the correct account.
#### My Thoughts

I've taken a look at the code, and the configuration saving/restoring needs to be rewritten. It's currently stored in the `SharedPreferences` for the account's book, but then if/when the widget is updated it tries to read the active book's `SharedPreferences`. We can solve this by either
1. having one big ""widget"" `SharedPreferences` object, and storing the book as another option for each widget, or
2. we can have a separate `SharedPreferences` object for each widget

I have a slight preference for the second option, but the first is more similar to the current implementation.

Would reduce the need to mark Favorites on each import. In our case this could mean a reduction in the number of clicks from 25 to 0. Ultimately, it would provide a more user friendly experience.

Priority:
Low/Nice to have. However, we suspect if others are doing the same they too may have run in to this situation and would also appreciate a reduction in the number of clicks.

This is a fairly minor issue that I've been seeing for a while that I just haven't gotten around to posting. In fact it took me a while to realize what was going on. When doing a post with split currencies, the work flow does something unnatural. I'll try to explain:
- post a transaction that splits currencies (such as a 300 THB expense paid for with a USD credit card)
- once everything is setup in the transaction window, click save
- the currency exchange window pops up. (This is expected.)
- once you complete filling in the currency exchange window and close it, it returns back to the transaction window. (This is the unexpected part.)
- you then have to click save in the transaction window a second time in order to complete the transaction.

Since for single currency transactions, clicking save closes the transaction window and completes the transaction, is there a reason that you have to click save twice to close the split currency transaction? Isn't the expected behavior that after completing the exchange rate step, the transaction is already completed and saved (since you've already clicked the save button) and the transaction window closed?

There seems to be some issue with the scheduled transaction defined in the file, because the splits aren't balanced. This causes a template transaction to be created with an imbalance split (in [`GncXmlHandler.endElement`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/importer/GncXmlHandler.java#L691)) and with a currency code as account UID.

The currency code as account UID in the split should be fixed when we finish parsing in [`GncXmlHandler.endDocument`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/importer/GncXmlHandler.java#L901), however, the scheduled actions are parsed first, and here's the problem. When a scheduled action has been parsed, [`GncXmlHandler.generateMissedScheduledTransactions`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/importer/GncXmlHandler.java#L795) is called. This method clones the template transaction, but the split with the currency code as account UID isn't added to `mAutoBalanceSplits` so as to be fixed at the end.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Crash on export with Xiaomi5,[],"I'm using 2.0.3 at the moment, with a new install.

`logcat` displays the following:

`
/data/user/0/org.gnucash.android/cache/OFX/20160621_183543_gnucash_export.ofx: open failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory)
`

The odd thing is that on first ever export, gnucash-android created the `export` folder where expected, just next to the `backup` folder in `/sdcard/org.gnucash.android/` but apparently was not able to create the file in it.

Any idea on how to change this folder?

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Total balance is incorrect for one of my accounts,[],"For one of my accounts the total balance is not correct. At the moment the total balance should be 1656.01BGN but the total balance shown is 1714.77BGN. There are no future transactions. I actually went through all transactions and calculated them by hand and came up with the exact same number as is shown in my actual bank account: 1656.01BGN.

I'm managing 9 accounts but this seems to be the only one exhibiting the problem. What is special about this account is that it is in BGN, but it contains several transactions that are done between this account and a couple of my other accounts which are in EUR. Possibly something has gone wrong in the currency conversion.

I'm willing to privately share a backup of my data files if this could help in debugging the problem.

In addition, the converted amount is (wrongly) stored with the currency of the 
original amount and rounded to its decimal places. If the original amount has
no decimal places, even more precision is lost.

For example, if the user transfers from a Yens account (no decimal places) to an
Euros account (2 decimal places) and enters:
- transaction amount = 10 (Yens, no decimal places)
- exchange rate = 0.123456

GnuCash calculates:
- converted transaction amount: 1 (1.23456 rounded to 0 decimals)
- exchange rate (stored in DB): 1/10 = 0.1

GnuCash should store directly the exchange rate instead of calculating it.

Normally, the split itself should have a zero balance, but when one of the splits goes to a Liability this split is not taken with the correct sign, so when balancing the total, one gets an additional split that goes to Imbalance.

Could this may be fixed by adding a num field to the QIF file. Looking at the QIF spec, such a field is supported and Gnucash shows one, too. Or is there an easier solution I am overlooking?

```

Steps to reproduce with default accounts:
1. Enter ""Assets"" account.
2. Select ""DELETE"" from the ""Current Assets"" account's menu.
3. Press ""Delete"".
4. The application crashes.

The problem is due to the code in [`mOkButton.setOnClickListener()`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/ui/account/DeleteAccountDialogFragment.java#L211).  The code under the condition `mMoveTransactionsRadioButton.isChecked()` is always executed, even when there aren't any transactions to move. This happens because, when the layout is loaded, `mMoveTransactionsRadioButton` is set to checked state.

The concrete condition under which the application crashes is when `mTransactionsDestinationAccountSpinner` doesn't have any item. Then, the call to `mTransactionsDestinationAccountSpinner.getSelectedItemId()` returns `INVALID_ROW_ID` (-9223372036854775808, see [javadoc](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.html#getSelectedItemId%28%29)) and `accountsDbAdapter.getUID(targetAccountId)` fails.

I'm working on a fix.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,New scheduled transaction like an existing one,[],"Hi, All,

I have a scheduled transaction for my home loan repayment (of course). I receive a letter from the bank saying that from a date two months away, my monthly repayment will change. So what I want to do is change the existing scheduled transaction so that it stops when appropriate and create a new one that starts the month later.

So, I place the cursor on one of the past transactions and click on the button,""create a scheduled transaction ... "". But, instead of creating a new one, it wants to edit the old one.

Now, of course I don't want to create a new transaction from scratch. The ""create"" button is just too easy. The only work around I have found is to go to a similar transaction several years ago, one, I suppose, not created by the existing scheduled transaction. Then the system does create a new scheduled transaction.

This isn't a big deal. It just doesn't work the way I expected it to.

Cheers

OfxExporter.generateExport() returns a file name with a time stamp different to
the first call in the same method. The root of the problem is
getExportCacheFilePath(), which builds the file name with the current time.

GnuCash Android version is 2.0.1 on both.

1. Enter any number of transactions.

3. Hit the Export Button
4. Select ""Sending"" as Export Target. Format is qif; all transactions
5. Hitting ""Export.""

Expected outcome:

What does happen:
Nothing. It claims to export. Then the ""Export to external Service"" message pops up, but the service selection never shows.

What else did i check:
I tried to send files via other apps. The ES Explorer opened the menu without a problem and let me put files on my owncloud as usual. 

As for now, i workaround the issue by exporting to SD card and sending with another application, but to put it frankly: That's a bit tedious.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Changing the transfer account of the split with the total amount set it to zero,[],"If a transaction is edited and the transfer account of the split entry with the positive amount is changed, the amount of the transaction is set to zero.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new transaction in _Expenses:Education_.
2. Enter a description and an amount.
3. Save the transaction.
4. Edit again the same transaction.
5. Open the split editor.
6. There will be two entries, one with negative amount and the other with a positive amount. For example -100 and 100.
7. Change the transfer account of the entry with the positive amount (100) to _Expenses:Books_.
8. Save the changes.
9. The split editor closes and the transaction account appears with 0 as its amount.

Some observations:
- The transactions disappears from _Expenses:Education_ and appears in _Expenses:Book_, just as expected.
- The amount of the transaction and its splits are set to 0.
- If after step 2, the split editor is opened instead, there's only the split with the positive amount and its transfer account can't be changed (the combo box is disabled).

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Unable to Sync with Google Drive,[],"I may just be doing it wrong, but I figured I'd ask here.

I currently am using both the Desktop version and decided to use the Android version as well today. My current book is stored in XML. I copied my gnucash data to a folder on Google Drive, and I've verified that it is syncing between devices. I can open it on the Android app just fine, and add additional transactions, but those transactions aren't reflected when I open it on the Desktop version. I have enabled Google Drive Sync in the Backup Preferences menu, and allowed it to run on my Google account. I have set the Default Export Format to XML, and have enabled `Export all transactions`. 

When I make a change or add a transaction, I see it reflected in the application. It does not seem to automatically sync. If I select the `Export` option in the `Transactions` section of the menu and select `Google Drive` as the Export Destination, I see that it has connected to Google, and it says `Exported to: Google Drive -> GnuCash`. However, I don't see any new or modified files in my Google Drive folder after syncing, and opening.

When I try to export to the SD card, I can't find any files added or removed that deal with GnuCash.

# Why I made this patch

After upgrading my Samsung Galaxy S2 to Cyanogen mod 12 with Lollipop 5.1.1 my Gnucash widget became ugly!
With dense home screen grid (5x5 and 6x5) it started to use 2 vertical grid cells instead of 1:

![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7319485/10416806/57889b72-702e-11e5-8cda-6d509d9b74f9.png)
# What I did

I created this patch to solve this problem.
It was not enough to decrease widget minHeight  to 40, because widget button does not fit:

![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7319485/10416807/5dda3224-702e-11e5-8f8e-8cf96003ba37.png)

So I made corrections to widget button properties to fix that. I also made widget vertical size resize-able, so anyone can return to 2-row widget if he got used to it :)

Result:

PS: Why button is not square ? Android has no easy way to ""centerInside"" backgroung of buttons, so it is not trivial to make it square. And squeezed button looks pretty good too.

PS2: This patch does not change widget view on standard screens, widget button is as square as before on standard screens.

Split.setValue will NOT set quantity any more. If quantity is null it will print an error message. Remove this check and error message when everyone knows this.

During import, the amount format should not contain any special characters according to gnucash XML doc. So I removed the special treatment for special characters.

Auto balance for multi-currency should work for gnucash generated XML files, but it won't work for old GNCA exports. Extra splits would be created.

The issue was introduced in commit bc84bc26e024fd7729d832d8496fe8af5ffe453b with the change of buildToolsVersion from version 21.1.2 to 22.0.1.

This new version of build tools removes the `showAsAction` attribute from the resource file when assembling the APK. I guess, because it's an attribute only supported since API level 11, while GnuCash defines `minSdkVersion 10`.

In [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17914017/android-4-3-menu-item-showasaction-always-ignored) they suggest to change the attribute's namespace, but then it doesn't compile. I guess it only works with `ActionBarCompat`.

If there's no reason behind the build tools version change other than using the latest, it could be reverted to the previously working one.

Another possibility would be to migrate to `ActionBarCompat`. Not sure how hard it would be or if it would even solve the problem. By the way, is this change in planned? I could do it if needed.

This happens with version 1.6.0 of GnuCash from a Huawei Ascend G300 (Android 2.3.6, API 10).

3. create a hashmap for fast UID query for account
4. FIX: import `split:quantity` instead of `split:value`.
   `split:quantity` uses currency of the split's account, not the currency of the transaction. This will make the account balance calculated in GncA the same as the on Desktop
5. If there's not ROOT in XML (old backups), create one.
6. Create non-exist Imbalance account when auto balancing transactions.
   The account is not created in the DB directly, but will be imported into the DB together with all other account.
   Fixes #318, while also specifying correct transaction UID.
7. Delay UID generation
   UID generation is delay until it is queried. A lot of instances will be created when importing, and the generated UID is useless as it will eventually be replaced by the imported UID. With UID generation delayed, UID generation will not be triggered when importing, which saves some time.
8. Delay generating amount and faster money parse
   `Money` and `BigDecimal` operations (such as `abs`, `divide`, `withCurrency` with generate new instances. By generating the necessary data before any instances is generated, a lot less objects would be generated, which will save some time and space.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,The new transaction autocomplete behaviour in develop may have usability problems,[],"I've had some confusion with the new transaction autocomplete function based on templates and I think it make bring some usability problems.

I've been looking for advantages of the new system, but the only I can think of is that now the user can select which transactions will appear in the autocomplete llist. This makes the list smaller and saves typing.

However, I see some disadvantages:
- When the user upgrades she'll have to either edit each transaction and check the option for it to appear in the dropdown or she'll have to type again these transactions.
- Requires more interaction from the user. In addition, she now has to scroll to the end of the form and check the option.
- The user must know the option exists. Taking into account that it's at the end of the form and, provably below the fold, makes it more difficult for the user to discover it.
- The user may not relate the ""Save as template"" with the autocompletion. In my case I didn't relate it until I looked at the code.
- The user may forget to check the ""Save as template"" option. He'd have to edit the transaction again to check the option or remember to check it when he enters the transaction again the next time.
- The behaviour is different from that of other applications and from previous versions of GnuCash. This can confuse users that expect the previous behaviour [[1]](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-top-ten-web-design-mistakes-of-1999/)(point 3) and think (like me) that it's a bug. I can't think of any application where the autocomplete entries of a form are explicitly selected by the user.
- The option adds more clutter to the interface. In my opinion, GnuCash should strive to have simpler screens instead of adding more options.
- If the user decides he no longer wants the transaction to appear in the dropdown, it may be difficult for him to find the one he marked as template.

Is there any other problem that the new behaviour solves apart from the number of transactions in the autocomplete dropdown? I there isn't, I'd rather go for improving the quality of the entries. For example, listing at the top the ones matching from the same account, the more recent, avoiding duplicates, etc.

Right now, in the worst case, the user just has to continue typing some more to filter out the unwanted entries.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Autocomplete problems,[],"(My experience with this bug relates to issue #254 but is perhaps separate.)

When I create an entry for a purchase, the autocomplete list shows up, per usual.  If I pick one of the suggestions, the previous amount associated with that suggestion populates the field (normal behavior).  Even if I change the value before saving the entry, the old value is retained.  Editing the entry later has the same result, the old transaction amount sticks.  Luckly I caught this before too many entries were affected.

I would like to be able to completely disable the autocomplete feature, or at least disable the automatic population of the transaction amount.  The majority of my transactions are not repetitive (different dollar amounts at the same stores, varying bills each month, etc), and it ends up creating a lot more work than it saves me time.

Thanks for your hard work on this project!

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Export using GnuCash log format (don't merge),[],"OFX and GIF both have their limitation, GncXML cannot be used for transfer transactions (it cannot be imported). Looking at the GnuCash import menu, it seem that only replay GnuCash Log can report everything GnuCash needs: multi-currency, double entry, description, notes, memo, etc. So I created this exporter for generating (fake) gnucash logs.

However it also has its limitations, making it not a good way for normal user to use.
1. The replay log function in GnuCash is not intended for export/impot, it will assume that the log is generated by GnuCash, so only limited error check is applied. This may easily cause the GnuCash book result in error state.
2. Accounts are identified by GUID in the log, so only accounts already exist in GnuCash book can be corretly used.
3. The log is basicly recorded in a split by split style, with two possibkle edit action: Edit(insert) and delete. With the current GnuCash Android internal DB, deletion of split cannot be recorded. So if a transaction is edited in GCA, with one split deleted, others modified, the deletion cannot be replayed in GnuCash. (In OFX or GIF export, a new transaction will be created in GnuCash in this situation, possibly)
4. No auto-balancing after replay. In the situation in 3, if the exported transation is balanced, the transaction in GnuCash will not be balanced with one extra split. Imbalanced transactions in the log will not be corrected either. The GnuCash book will result in a strange state.

But for people who understands all the odds of log and replay log function, it can be a good way of export / import.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Project structure,[],"Let's continue our dicussion in #247 here, as it is already unrelated with the original topic.
1. You're right the develop is ahead of master, but that also means that we cannot merge from develop to master unless we are ready for 1.6.0 or 2.0. bugfixes must be cherry picked from develop to master. I think merge is better than cherry-pick.
2. As develop is ahead of master, some edits can only be applied to develop, but not possible on master. It will be hard to test which commit should be cherry-picked to master with a branch from it.
3. Bugs on master should be tested on master, and so does the bug fixes.

So I'm suggesting project structure like this:

----master
      ----hotfix

----develop

Bugfix (pull requests) can be made on hotfix. bugfix/hotfix will be merged to both master and develop.

New feature and bugfixes for bugs introduced by new features will be on develop.

When hotfix is ready, it can be merged to master to get v1.5.4 , and a new bugfix branch should be branched from v1.5.4.

Like #248 and #249 , I started these bugfixes both from seeing #247. But as the new features on develop, master and develop branches behave differently. It will hard to get a fix on master if we work only on develop.

Pressing ""save"" or changing the account dropdown list on the upper left corner wouldn't change the transaction, an warning is shown instead.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Discussion: Multi-currency support,[],"1. Accounts in different currencies.

This is already implemented in GnuCash Android, and works well.
1. Transactions between accounts in different currencies

This is not officially supported by GnuCash Android. Currently, a use cannot create new transactions between different currencies. However, throw importing, such transactions can be added to GnuCash Android, and should also be edited and exported (maybe not correctly).

Implement proper support for this possible, but the problem is, the user will ultimately export the transactions and import them into GnuCash Desktop. Currently I see no possible way to do this. 

So I think even we implement the feature, we should limit what users can do with these transactions.

i. When importing form GnuCash, multi-currency transactions should be kept, in order get correct account balance. Amounts in the split's currency (`split:quantity`, instead of the transaction's `split::value`) should be used. Multi-currency support is only need for balancing these transactions.

ii. Transactions involving multiple currencies cannot be edited or created (as they cannot be transferred to GnuCash Android). However, they can be deleted.

iii. Transactions involving multiple currencies cannot be exported to QIF. QIF does not support these transactions so the result would be in error. They can be filtered out when exporting.

iv. Proper multi-currency support should be needed to generate correct GncXML export. Both `split:quantity` and `split:value` should exist, and they will differ if the transactions currency is different from the split's currency.

I think ii and iii should be enforced from now on, until we can find a way to transfer such transactions into GnuCash. i and iv can wait for proper multi-currency support.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Separate QIF export files by transaction currency,[],"up to 913120d , it only deal with export to SD card, and will break export by file sharing ( due to the altered QIF file, see bellow)

Altered the QIF file in the internal storage. Transactions with grouped by currency, and each group will have a ""*XXX"" line at the beginning, where XXX is the currency code.

Then, when export to SD card, this file is split up into multiples files in `copyFile()`, each file containing only transactions in one currency, according to the currency tags added previous. The `currencyCode` is attached to the exported QIF file name.

Nothing has been done on exporting by file sharing yet. Suggestions are welcome.

This will break the QIF export `MigrationHelper`. I didn't seem to find where the QIF export in `MigrationHelper` is used.

The QIF format does not mark currency. When you import a QIF into GnuCash Desktop you may select one (and only one) currency per import, and that is applied to all transactions in that import.

Therefore, GnuCash Android needs to be able to export multiple QIF files. If a user of GnuCash is using two different currencies then he/she should be able to (with one click) export two QIF files (one for currency A, and one for currency B). The user will then do two imports into GnuCash Desktop, and select the correct currency for each QIF file imported.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Some thought on DB.,[],"1.
Now the join :
`transactions , splits ON transactions.uid = splits.transaction_uid , accounts ON accounts.uid = splits.account_uid`
is used a lot. What about creating a [VIEW](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_createview.html) on this? The duplicate column name may cause some problems though ...
I may try to play with a temporary view first.

2.
With `FOREIGN KEY` constraint, which already exists in the DB, `ON DELETE CASCADE` can be add to the `FOREIGN EKY` constraint, so that when the parent key is deleted, the row referencing the key is also delete. This will save some work when deleting Accounts/Transactions, as the splits get deleted automatically.
This would result in unbalanced transactions. The current App does enforce the transactions to be balanced, and a lot operation will result in unbalanced transactions.
With `ON DELETE CASCADE`, we must be careful not to delete account/transaction first if splits are meant to be kept. Their account_id and transaction_id must be set to other appropriate values before deleting the account/transactions.
According to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10719425/foreign-key-constraint-on-delete-cascade-not-working-in-sqlite-database-on-andro), `ON DELETE CASCADE` should work from Android 2.2 , which is API level 8.

2. After the parent account is changed, the full name of the edited account is updated, but the descendant accounts' full name are not updated.
3. There's no way to set parent account to the ROOT account. In a book imported from GnuCash, top level accounts have their parent account checked, but the account name empty (development branch). The ROOT account never appear in the candidates. I tried that remove the parent account will put an account in top level, but I think this is a little inconsistent.
   There's maybe two things to dicuss:
   In the DB, will account without a parent be allowed (except the ROOT account)?
   I think they should not be allowed.
   In the UI, how to set an account to top level (direct child of ROOT account)?

Tested with my multi-currency book and the balance shown is the same as the original approach. Didn't test when recurrence transactions are involved.

Created a new entry function taking GUID as parameter instead of rowIdx.

Now the balance is calculated in this way:
1. get the all related accounts, i.e. all descendent account of the current account whose currency is the same the parent account. 
2. Use SQL query to get the balance. The SQL statement is something like :
  `SELECT TOTAL ( CASE WHEN splits.type = 'DEBIT' THEN splits.amount ELSE - splits.amount END ) FROM splits, transactions WHERE splits.account_uid in ( accounts_list ) AND splits.transaction_uid = transactions.uid AND transaction.recurrence_period = 0`
3. adjust he returned value with the parent account's type. 

Possible draw backs may be that floating point calculation and floating point number are used in step 2, which is always bad when money is involved. However, double precision should be precise enough for this task with proper rounding, when no number more than 10e12 is involved. Don't know if any currency would need that large number.

This let me think, should we allow importing two different book? If we allow it, how to merge them?

My idea is to forbid such importing, to make things simple and clear. Importing is only allowed when:

Main modifications on bulk mode:
1. Account, Transaction, Split are not inserted into the db when they are encountered. The information are gather and saved, and they are all inserted into the db at the end of the parsing the XML file.
2. `beginTransation()`, `setsetTransactionSuccessful()`, `endTransaction()` methods are used to control db transactions, thus _all or none_ of the accounts (or transaction, splits) would be inserted/updated into the db.
3. `SQLiteStatement` is used instead `insert` or `update` call. (Several articles [like this](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/turbocharge-your-sqlite-inserts-on-android/) claims this should much faster)

The 'db access time' is the time used by bulk insertion after the commit. It is hard to calculate the db access time before the commit as they are scattered everywhere during import process.

Note in debug mode (when you hit 'debug' in the IDE instead of 'run'), the App can be much slower, and will take 30min to import File1 before the commit and 8min after.

Possible defects:
1. Exceptions during db insertion are caught, so the main import procedure will not know about them and report success. May consider re-throwing.
2. Insertion of Accounts, Transaction and Splits are independent. So there is a possibility that all accounts are imported, but no transactions or splits, or all transactions are imported but no splits. I think the former may be tolerable, but the latter may cause problems.

More commits may follow up to deal with the defects.

More commits may also follow up in the performance improvements in other parts of the App ( Such as balance calculation, exporting, etc). Do you think it is appropriate to put them all here? Or should I use new pull request?

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,Export format incorrectly defaults to QIF,[],"## Setup

Nexus 5
Android v4.4, build KRT16M
GnuCash for Android v1.2.6, installed via Google Play
Set default export format to OFX
## Expected Behavior

Exporting transactions will result in a file of the chosen format
## Observed Behavior

Export Transactions window shows OFX radio button selected for export format, however, the exported file is of QIF format.  Problem does not occur if the user selects first the QIF radio button and then switches back to the OFX button; in that case, an OFX file is produced as expected.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,OFX file generated with incorrect account type,[],"Possibly linked to #100 , I'm having trouble importing transactions from GnuCash Android to Desktop v 2.4.11.

I exported an accounts file and GCA created the correct account structure, but then when I tried to create an OFX file of transactions to import back into the Desktop version it told me the accounts were unrecognized and I had to manually select them.

I suspect this is because the account type is being set incorrectly in the OFX file.

For example, the details of one of the accounts was:

```
<gnc:account version=""2.0.0"">
  <act:name>Piano</act:name>

Currently, when I add a transaction on an asset account 'A', enter value 50 and chose debit (a red ""DEBIT"" with a green bar below is displayed), then the amount is displayed as negative and A's balance will be decreased.

codinguser/gnucash-android,closed,ReOpen: GNUChash cannot detect encoding in new version of OFX file (my comment in issue #16),[],"Hello, codinguser.

It is SERIOUS problem for users use CJK characters.

Gnucash supporse import OFX is SGML type.
For example (http://www.ofx.net/OFXExamplesPage/OFXExamples.aspx).

But,  GnucashMobile exports XML type OFX.

Gnucash (exactly libofx) cannot interpret XML header like
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> .

So, Gnucash(libofx) judge OFX file(UTF-8) is encoded by ""CP1252"" .
I tested to use Japanese characters, it all changed garbage bad characters when it was imported !!

libofx's header reading code is around line 202 of https://github.com/bdonlan/libofx/blob/master/lib/ofx_preproc.cpp

And, default value ""CP1252"" defined line 50 of same file.

4. Exit from the app (hit the home or back buttons)
5. Open GnuCash
6. Open the account from (1)
7. Touch the transaction to edit. At this point the app crashes.

I'm don't think it is required to exit the app (4) but I haven't tested that yet.

I had thought the problem was to do with updating to version 1.0.2 ( from 1.0 beta 2), but I can reproduce the crash on the older version too. I was running Android 4.1.2 until recently so it may be something to do with the OS update.

So I repost it here:

Hi!
Today I've made apk from latest develop and tried export OFX and import.
Suppose fix didn't resolve problem... GnuCash cannot understand encoding (version 2.4.11 too).

I dug more about OFX file format and found out this:

Old version of OFX header was a set of parameters as I wrote in previous post including ""ENCODING:UTF-8"",
new version has only several required params and another syntax (that one you use):

<?OFX OFXHEADER=""200"" VERSION=""211"" SECURITY=""NONE"" ENCODING=""UTF-8"" OLDFILEUID=""NONE"" NEWFILEUID=""NONE""?>
And parameter ENCODING=""UTF-8"" hasn't to be there and should be ignored by software.
So, latest changes should be rolled back :(. Sorry.

Idea is xml header (<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>) already has encoding information.

Only way I can make Gnucash show correct encoding is to add old OFX version header part ""ENCODING:UTF-8"" in the very beginning of OFX.

It seems problem is in Gnucash, I'll try inform developers.

But only as walk-around is it possible add old styte header in OFX?
