- Change title/author delimiter from â€˜,â€™ to â€˜.â€™ and print title in bold for better readability and clarity (see e.g. third item where is wasn't particularly clear where the title ends and the author starts)
- Remove details about person after Â¬ sign (at least Dresden municipal library often has further information such as author, editor, producer etc. after the person's name) (see first and last item)

Add branch information to the list. I regularly borrow books from different branches of the same library. When I need to return a book I want to see what other books I hold from the same branch. This was only possible by clicking for details of each individual item which is quite cumbersome for a longer list.

I suspect the reason for this is that the app may load the second page more than once because there are multiple links pointing to it (link to page 2, link to the next page, link to the last page). I changed the code so that the links are saved in a HashMap, so a link cannot appear more than once. The result is checked with a unit test, but I couldn't test it in the app with a real account because none of our working SISIS test accounts has more than 10 lent items (actually, none of them has *any* lent items)."

We try to write this issue as instructive as possible, but as we're humans we almost certainly forgot to write something important in here. If you want to try to tackle this issue and get stuck at _any_ point, please do not hesitate and ask us, either here on GitHub or via email at info@opacapp.de. We'll be very happy to help! 

We think this issue is very suitable to people who are just starting with Open Source or Android development in general and have never done it before. We'd like to ask people with wide experience in contributing to leave this issue to beginners. Thanks!
## How to get started

First of all, we recommend that you [install the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.geeksfactory.opacclient) and play around with it so you know how it looks and feels. Next, you should use git to download this GitHub repository and open the folder `opacclient/` in Android Studio. Press the green ""Play"" button to run it on your device. If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!

If you don't have an account in one of the [supported libraries](https://en.opacapp.net/libraries/), you can select the library that just has the name ""Test"". Note that this library is only included in the list if you compile the app yourself, you will not find it in the builds from the Play Store.
## What this is about

When you search for books in the catalog of a library, in many cases the app will display the cover picture of the book -- in the search result list, in the detail view or even both. A few users have requested that there should be an option in the app to disable downloading these covers while they are on a mobile data network so that the app uses slightly less data.
## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.
- Create a new setting (`CheckBoxPreference`) in the [settings.xml](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/xml/settings.xml) file and add the corresponding strings in English. We can handle the translations for you. We think the setting best fits in the general category called ""Web Opac"". The default behavior should be to always load covers (as previously).
- We have recently decided to access all new preferences not directly, but using our [`PreferenceDataSource`](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/storage/PreferenceDataSource.java) class. So you should implement new methods there that access the new preference.
- Have a look at [`ResultsAdapter`, Line 156](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/ResultsAdapter.java#L156). As you can see there, if `item.getCover()`, which holds the cover URL, is set, the cover will be loaded. Here, you need to add an additional check the state of your newly-added setting and then, if needed, check whether the user is on a mobile network (e.g. using [`ConnectivityManagerCompat.isActiveNetworkMetered()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/net/ConnectivityManagerCompat.html#isActiveNetworkMetered(android.net.ConnectivityManager)). If the cover should not be loaded, we can just show the media type icon as already implemented here.
- The same logic also needs to be implemented in [`SearchResultDetailFragment`, Line 1299](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SearchResultDetailFragment.java#L1299) so that the `LoadCoverTask` is only executed when the preference is set to always load covers or when the device is on an unmetered network.
- Test your new setting on a device or emulator with a library that supports displaying covers.

We're excited to see your pull request!

We try to write this issue as instructive as possible, but as we're humans we almost certainly forgot to write something important in here. If you want to try to tackle this issue and get stuck at _any_ point, please do not hesitate and ask us, either here on GitHub or via email at info@opacapp.de. We'll be very happy to help!

We think this issue is very suitable to people who are just starting with Open Source or Android development in general and have never done it before. We'd like to ask people with wide experience in contributing to leave this issue to beginners. Thanks!

## How to get started

First of all, we recommend that you [install the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.geeksfactory.opacclient) and play around with it so you know how it looks and feels. Next, you should use git to download this GitHub repository and open the folder `opacclient/` from within the repository (not the repository itself) in Android Studio.

Before running the app, you should run the `downloadJson` Gradle task which loads the configuration files for all the libraries in the app from our server. You can either do this using Android Studio's *Gradle Tool Window* or by running `./gradlew downloadJson` on the command line.

Press the green ""Play"" button to run it on your device. If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!

## What this is about

When you start the app and set up a library account (just choose any library and select ""anonymous account"", you do not need a password), you can search for items in that library. If you click one of the results to go to the detail view, there is a ""star"" icon to add this item to your favorites list.

The favorites list is only saved locally in the app - so when users switch to a new phone, the items that were saved to their favorites list will be gone (if you don't use any backup solution). This is why we would like you to add a simple export and import functionality to the app.

We already have a feature that allows to share the items on the favorites list as a human-readable text (including the book title and the link to the library catalog), but we think that for an export/import functionality, the better data format would be a JSON file.

## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.

The favorites list is displayed by the `StarredFragment` class, which also contains the [implementation of our current sharing feature](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/StarredFragment.java#L228). We would like you to create a similar function that exports the data to a JSON file and allows the user to choose a location to save it to. You can add a menu item to the Action Bar that will trigger this export feature.

You can create the JSON data either manually using the [JSONObject](https://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONObject.html) and [JSONArray](https://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONArray.html) classes included in Android or automatically using the [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) library, which we already use in the app for other purposes. The JSON file should include:

- The ID of the library which this list is for (-> a list of favorites cannot be transferred to a different library), which can be obtained using `app.getLibrary().getIdent()`
- The list of items on the list, which their three properties `mNr` (media ID in the library catalog), `title` and `mediaType`. (see the [Starred](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/libopac/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/objects/Starred.java) class)

When you are ready with creating the JSON data, you can let the user choose where to save it. We think the best way for this is using Android's [Storage access framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html#create), because it does not require additional permissions and already provides you with a file chooser dialog. However, it is only available on Android 4.4 and above, so you need to make sure that the app displays an appropriate message (or allows to save the data using a ""share"" intent instead) on older versions.

The last part would be to add an additional menu item to the Action Bar for the import feature. This should then again display a file chooser, load the JSON data, check if the list is for the same library and then save the items to the favorites list.

We're excited to see your pull request!

When you start the app and set up a library account (just choose any library and select ""anonymous account"", you do not need a password), you can search for items in that library. If you click one of the results, you get into the detail view. Here, (either as an icon in the top-right area or in the menu) there is a share button that allows you to ""Export details"".

This will allow you to send the media information (author, title, year, ...) to another app. If you scroll down in the detail view, you see that in most libraries we also have information on the specific copies of that item, e.g. how many there are, where, if they are available, etc. It would be nice to include them in the exported output as well.

## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.

The Java source file you need to look at is [`SearchResultDetailFragment.java`](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SearchResultDetailFragment.java). In the `onOptionsItemSelected` method around line 670, there is a part that constructs a string `text` that can be sent to other apps via the ""share"" option in the app if a search result is opened.

You should add some code there which
- reads all ``Copy`` elements from ``getItem().getCopies()``
- adds appropriate blocks to `text`

You can have a look at the ``onBindViewHolder`` method in ``CopiesAdapter.java`` or at ``Copy.java`` itself to see which fields are available.

## What this is about

When you start the app and set up a library account, you can input details of your account, namely a label, your username or library membership ID and password. This issue is about the password input field.

The Android Support Library supports adding a button to password input fields that allows you to toggle the password between the normal ""disguised"" state and a visible state. An example of this can be seen [here](https://material.io/guidelines/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-password-input).

We would like you to add this button to our password input. As a security measure, it should only be shown when an account is first created or when there is no password currently set for the account. This makes sure that the password can not be revealed later by a malicious user opening the account editing view again.

## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.

The Java source file you need to look at is [`AccountEditActivity.java`](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/AccountEditActivity.java). In the `onCreate` method, the password field (`etPassword`) is filled with the password if one was already set.

You should add some code to the end of the `onCreate` method which
- checks if the contents of the password field are empty (which means the account is new or there was no password set before)
- if so, enables the password visibility toggle for the `TextInputLayout` called `tilPassword`.

You can find the documentation how to enable the toggle [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/TextInputLayout.html#setPasswordVisibilityToggleEnabled(boolean)).

## How to get started

First of all, we recommend that you [install the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.geeksfactory.opacclient) and play around with it so you know how it looks and feels. Next, you should use git to download this GitHub repository and open the folder `opacclient/` from within the repository (not the repository itself) in Android Studio.

Because of a [Bug in Android Studio](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=172347), some configuration files in the `.idea` folder might be deleted after opening the project for the first time. Run `git checkout -- opacclient/.idea/` in the repository to revert this.

Press the green ""Play"" button to run it on your device. If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!
## What this is about

When you start the app and set up a library account, you can input details of your account, namely a label, your username or library membership ID and password.

We would like to replace the `EditText`s for these three inputs with the [`TextInputLayout`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/TextInputLayout.html) from the Android Design Support Library.
## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.

The XML layout file you need to look at is [`activity_account_edit.xml`](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/layout/activity_account_edit.xml). Replacing the three `EditTexts` with `TextInputLayouts` should be quite straightforward. Make sure that the `ImageView` `ivBarcode` stays on the right side of the input for the username/membership ID.

If you should need to change something (such as View IDs and class imports) in the Java code of the Activity, it is located [here](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/AccountEditActivity.java).

## What this is about

When you start the app and set up a library account, you can search this library's catalog, view the search result list and click on the results to get detailed information about a single item, including things like where it is located in the library. Pull Request #440 (see also issue #431) added a printing feature to the app, which means that these details can be sent to a printer using the print button (or overflow menu item on narrow screens) on devices with Android >= 4.4. The print feature is based on an HTML page that is generated by the app.

The printing feature is not yet included in the current version of the app on the Play Store, so you have to install the app from Android Studio if you want to try it.

This issue is about making the printed output a little nicer by applying some CSS to the generated HTML. We have listed some suggestions below, but if you have more ideas, feel free to ask us here and implement them afterwards.

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.

The file you need to look at is [`print_template.mustache`](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/raw/print_template.mustache). It is basically an HTML file that is filled with data using the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templating language. You can add a `<style>` tag to the `<head>` section for your CSS. Below are some suggestions what could be done to improve the printed layout:
- Text in tables should be aligned to the top of the cell (instead of centered). Text in the first column (`<th>`) should additionally be aligned to the right edge (instead of centered).
- Cell padding could be increased
- Data for copies and volumes is shown in multiple tables, one for each copy/volume. These tables should
  - have a vertical margin between them so that they are distinguishable from each other
  - be shown in two-column layouts (two tables next to each other). You can look at [CSS3 multi-column layouts](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp) for this. Don't forget the `-webkit-` prefixes that are needed to support older versions of Chrome. We have not tried if it works like this with tables in the columns, so please contact us if you run into problems.
- Below all the data, a text ""printed from Web Opac App (opacapp.net)"" should appear. You can make this slightly smaller than the rest of the text and change its color to gray.

As mentioned above, we are also open to additional suggestions about what could be improved.

Next, you should use git to download this GitHub repository and open the folder `opacclient/` from within the repository (not the repository itself) in Android Studio.

Press the green ""Play"" button to run it on your device. If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!
## What this is about

When you start the app and set up a library account, you can search this library's catalog, view the search result list and click on the results to get detailed information about a single item, including things like where in the library it is available. Users who only have a tablet (not a smartphone) have requested a feature that sends these details to a printer to be able to take them to their library on a sheet of paper.
## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.
### Adding the print function

In this part, you are going to add a ""Print"" button to the app that prints a sample HTML document.
- Have a look at the [Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/printing/html-docs.html) on printing HTML documents to familiarize yourself with the API you are going to use.
- In the [menu resource file](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/menu/search_result_details_activity.xml), add a new menu item labelled ""Print"". If you like, you can also add an appropriate Material Design icon and set it to show as an action button if there is room.
- In the `onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem)` method of [SearchResultDetailFragment.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SearchResultDetailFragment.java#L577), add an additional case to handle clicking the ""Print"" button. You can create a new method that is called when this button is clicked.
- Add some code to your method to print a sample HTML document when the button is clicked, similar to the sample in the documentation mentioned above.
- Make sure that your code is only called on Android 4.4 (API level 19) and above and hide the ""Print"" button on other versions. The Printing API is not available on lower versions.
- Make sure that the details are already loaded when the print button is clicked, similarly to how it is done for the [Favorite button](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SearchResultDetailFragment.java#L693).
- Test the printing function by running the app on your device or an Android Emulator.
### Generating the HTML output

In this part, you are going to write the code that generates the actual HTML that is going to be printed, using the data from the detailled search result. This can be done conveniently using a templating language such as _mustache_.
- Have a look at some [documentation](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) about the _mustache_ templating language and its [usage](https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java/blob/master/README.md) in Java.
- Add the _mustache.java_ library to the project by inserting the following line into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/build.gradle) file:

``` gradle
    compile 'com.github.spullara.mustache.java:compiler:0.8.18'
```
- We have prepared a [sample](https://drop.rami.io/GHkmIX/) how the generated HTML should look like. Copy this HTML code to a new `.mustache` file in the `/src/main/res/raw` folder and adjust it so that it contains _mustache_ templating tags instead of the sample data. The documentation linked above should be helpful for this.
- In the [utils](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/tree/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/utils) package, create a new class called `PrintUtils` that contains a static method called `printDetail`. This should take a [DetailledItem](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/libopac/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/objects/DetailledItem.java) as a parameter and return HTML code as a string.
- Implement this method by using the _mustache.java_ library, similar to this:

``` java
    InputStream is = getContext().getResources().openRawResource(resourceId);
    BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));

    MustacheFactory mf = new DefaultMustacheFactory();
    Mustache mustache = mf.compile(r, ""print_template.mustache"");
    StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
    mustache.execute(sw, detailledItem).flush();
    return sw.toString();
```
- Go back to SearchResultDetailFragment.java and use the new `printDetail` function to generate the HTML from the `DetailledItem` stored in the `item` field.
- Test the printing feature once again.

We try to write this issue as instructive as possible, but as we're humans we almost certainly forgot to write something important in here. If you want to try to tackle this issue and get stuck at _any_ point, please do not hesitate and ask us, either here on GitHub or via email at info@opacapp.de. We'll be very happy to help! 

We think this issue is very suitable to people who are just starting with Open Source or Android development in general and have never done it before. We'd like to ask people with wide experience in contributing to leave this issue to beginners. Thanks!
## How to get started

First of all, we recommend that you [install the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.geeksfactory.opacclient) and play around with it so you know how it looks and feels. Next, you should use git to download this GitHub repository and open the folder `opacclient/` in Android Studio. Press the green ""Play"" button to run it on your device. If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!
## What this is about

When you use the app to search for a book, you can save it to your favorites list, which is accessible through the navigation drawer. When you delete an item from the favorites list, it is currently directly deleted without any warning. We would like to provide the user with a [Snackbar](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar.html) that offers a button to undo removing the last item.
## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.
- Have a look at the `remove(Starred)` method in [StarredFragment.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/StarredFragment.java#L177). This removes an item from the database.
- Save the removed item in a new `private` field and show a Snackbar using [Snackbar.make](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar.html#make%28android.view.View,%20int,%20int%29), [setAction](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar.html#setAction%28int,%20android.view.View.OnClickListener%29) and [show](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar.html#show%28%29). You need to add appropriate strings to [strings.xml](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).
- Implement the `OnClickListener` you set in `setAction` to re-add the removed item to the `StarDataSource`.

Next, you should use git to download this GitHub repository and open the folder `opacclient/` from within the repository (not the repository itself) in Android Studio.

Because of a [Bug in Android Studio](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=172347), some configuration files in the `.idea` folder might be deleted after opening the project for the first time. Run `git checkout -- opacclient/.idea/` in the repository to revert this.

## What this is about

When you first started the app, it showed a list of all the available libraries. This screen is also shown when the user later decides to create an additional account. If a library is missing in the list, there is a yellow button at the bottom that allows you to suggest another library. The first text field here allows you to input a location and shows ""auto-complete"" suggestions when you input a city name. There are two things we would like to improve about these suggestions:

First, we are currently using the Google Maps Geocoding API for this auto-complete functionality, while there is a special ""Places Autocomplete"" API that would better suit this use case. Using that API, meaningful suggestions should already appear after typing a few letters (currently, you usually have to type the whole city name before the correct suggestion appears).

Second, the suggestions are currently always in German. We would instead like to switch the language for the suggestions depending on the current language of the app.
## How to do this

We recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.
- Have a look at the `autocomplete(String)` method in [SuggestLibraryActivity.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SuggestLibraryActivity.java#L176), which calls the geocoding API, and the relevant portion of the [Places Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete#place_autocomplete_requests) documentation. 
- Update the `GEOCODE_API` constant at the top of the file to instead use `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/autocomplete/json` as the base URL.
- Go back to the `autocomplete(String)` method and update the parameters that are appended to the URL in line [183](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SuggestLibraryActivity.java#L183). You should specify the `input` parameter and set `types=(cities)` to constrain the result to only include cities. You additionally need to specify an API key in the `key` parameter. We have already prepared such an API key for you: `AIzaSyDau_9TkGF8hVqLlcHhq6yDUUN9c3rqehU`
- Also specify the `language` parameter. You should be able to get the correct language code using `getResources().getConfiguration().locale.toLanguageTag()`.
- Look at the response the API returns. You can either do this by opening the same URL in a web browser or by using [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/), which we have already set up for you (just open `chrome://inspect` in the Chrome browser on your computer and connect to your device, you can then see the HTTP requests in the `Network` tab).
- For each suggestion, you need to get the `place_id` attribute from the JSON data. To get the detailed data, you can then do do a second HTTP request for every single suggestion, e.g. `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=ChIJAVkDPzdOqEcRcDteW0YgIQQ&key=AIzaSyDau_9TkGF8hVqLlcHhq6yDUUN9c3rqehU`, which returns data in the same format that the previously used [Geocoding API](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?sensor=false&language=de&region=de&address=berlin) had, which means you do not need to change much of code used for parsing the JSON data.
- Test if autocompletion works on your Android device. Also try if changing the device language influences the results.

If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!

If you don't have an account in one of the [supported libraries](https://en.opacapp.net/libraries/), you can select the library that just has the name ""Test"". Note that this library is only included in the list if you compile the app yourself, you will not find it in the builds from the Play Store.
## What this is about

When you try to renew a lent item (clicking the ""refresh"" symbol next to an entry in the account view), you will be asked whether you really want to do this, because in some libraries this might cost money etc. Some of our users get annoyed by this, so we want to provide a ""Do not ask me again"" option to them.

Luckily for you, we already have this feature somewhere else in the app (when trying to reserve an item) and you can take lots of inspiration from there.
## How to do this

I recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.
- Have a look at `reservationDo()` in [SearchResultDetailFragment.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/SearchResultDetailFragment.java#L879). As you can see there, if the `reservation_fee_warning_ignore` setting is set, `reservationPerform` will be executed immediately, otherwise the user will be asked to confirm using a dialog built from the [dialog_reservation_fees.xml](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/layout/dialog_reservation_fees.xml) layout. If the dialog is confirmed positively and the checkbox ""do not ask again"" was checked, 
- Create a similar dialog layout `dialog_prolong_confirm.xml` (or a similar name)
- Go to `prolong()` in [AccountFragment.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/AccountFragment.java#L525) and restructure it in a similar way. You probably want to split it into two functions as well, e.g. `prolong()` and `prolongPerform()`. Decide on a new name for a setting used to store the ""do not ask again"" state. You do not need to copy over the `getSupportFlags`-related condition from the `if`-Statement `reservationDo`.

If this works, you have a working development setup, yay! If it doesn't, feel free to ask us for help!
## What this is about

When you first started the app, it asked you to create an 'account' for a library so the app knows which library's catalogue you want to search and how to log in there. If you do not actively use a public library, you probably created an anonymous account that can be used for search only. However, if you wanted to add login information, you'd need to type in a username and a password. In most libraries, this user name is an account number that is printed on your library membership card in form of a barcode.

We think it'd be cool if there was a ""scan barcode"" button to directly scan the barcode of the membership card and enter the number into the text field. This is the task of this issue.

For actually scanning the barcode, you'll need a barcode scanner app like [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android). The app already contains code to communicate with these external apps.
## How to do this

I recommend forking this repository and creating a special git branch for this issue before you start. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request later. If you've never done this before, there are a lot of good guides out there and you can always ask us questions.
- The first step would be to add the respective button. Luckily, we also have barcode buttons in the search form where you can take some inspiration. You find the account editing layout in [activity_account_edit.xml](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/layout/activity_account_edit.xml) and a sample for a field with a barcode button in [searchfield_barcode.xml](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/res/layout/searchfield_barcode.xml).
- In [AccountEditActivity.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/AccountEditActivity.java), you need to listen to a click event on the newly created button and initiate a barcode scan if it is pressed. You can do this with two very simple lines that look like the `scanBarcode` method you can find in [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/opacapp/src/main/java/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/frontend/MainActivity.java#L284). This will start an external barcode canning app.
- If the user scanned a barcode using the external app, he will redirected back to our app. To receive the result, you need to implement the `onActivityResult` method. Again, you can take a look at the `onActivityResult` of `MainActivity`. It again uses the `BarcodeScanIntegrator` helper class to obtain the result and then passes the result to `SearchFragment`. In your case, you should replace this by inserting the scan result content into the account number text field.

This happens after clicking on a notification and is thus less dramatic than a failed notification. Nevertheless, it means that MainActivity is called with an invalid alarm ID.
This is probably fixed by 4ca2e91a7616e502db0a3597712b95ffdf96786c.

"
raphaelm/opacclient,closed,Updated reminder feature,[],"I completely reimplemented the reminder feature and its background service. The new procedure can be roughly described as follows:
- `ReminderCheckService` was replaced with `SyncAccountService`, which is only responsible for downloading account data and saving it to the database. It is currently set to run every hour, see the comment in `SyncAccountAlarmListener` for explanation. `SyncAccountService` uses [commonsguy/cwac-wakeful](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-wakeful/) to be assured stay awake while working.
- After downloading account data, lent media will be grouped by its deadline dates and corresponding entries will be saved to the new `alarms` DB table. They contain the list of items expiring and the scheduled notification time. All saved notifications from the DB will be scheduled using `AlarmManager` and rescheduled every time the device is rebooted. This allows notifications to be shown in times without internet connection, which is why the corresponding note in the settings was removed.
- Notifications will contain a list of expiring media and two buttons: `Don't remind again` and `Remind me again at...` (""Snooze""). The latter will open dialogs to select the date and time (these dialogs don't use Material Design in older Android versions, because they are not included in the Support Library).
- Notifications that were swiped away or clicked to open the app will automatically be re-scheduled between 12 and 2 hours after dismissal (depending on the time left until the media needs to be returned). This functionality can be disabled in the settings
- Known problems:
  - Notifications displaying while the app is being updated or force-closed will disappear and not come again
  - ~~The titles of the two buttons in the notification are too long to be completely visible~~ fixed in 135dd31.
  - `SyncAccountService` will also run when notifications are disabled. This is not necessary. The simplest option would be to check the settings before doing work in `SyncAccountService`, but this would still wake the device every time it runs.

In this process, I refactored the data structure for lent and reserved account items so that we have proper classes for those objects (instead of the previous `Map<String, String>` which actually was a remainder from the implementation using the `ContentValues` for Android's SQLite database directly prior to that). They also use Joda Time instead of timestamps for all dates.
Refactoring all the APIs to use Joda Time was quite complex and could cause issues because it was not tested for all the APIs, especially for the fields `readyDate` and `expirationDate` in `ReservedItem`, which only used Strings and no timestamps before.

The notification functionality and also the refactored APIs (see above) were not tested much, so we should do that before merging. Testing it with the larger amount of test accounts that @raphaelm has access to is probably a good idea.

Besides the fact that our PICA implementation apparently does not notice wrong account data (but displays an empty account), which I fixed in fe4558f, it looks to me as if this code tries to parse URLs based on positions, assuming e.g. that PW_ENC is the last query argument. In this case, it fails as PW_ENC is not even in the URL. @johan12345, would you mind to change this to use the `BasApi.getQueryParamsFirst`  utility method -- with a check whether the parameter is present?
I do not know what this error is caused by in Hamburg, but I do not have account data for _any_ PICA library so it is _really_ hard to change that kind of stuff blindly.
