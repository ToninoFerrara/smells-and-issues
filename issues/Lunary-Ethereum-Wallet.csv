I have been contributing to open source projects lately, and I wish to also add to yours. I noticed your project have no Privacy Policy and FAQs, which I will like to do that for you. 
A Privacy Policy lets users of the app know about the policies regarding end-users information collection and use. Also, FAQs will answer some question users might want to have and save both you and the users the stress of asking and you answering the same set of question over and over again.

What's the recommended way to fix this?  Is there a default password that would have been used?"

However, I've created a 2nd wallet and using a password generator to generate password with symbol, now I cannot send fund because it says password invalid, I'm guessing if there's something wrong with symbol encoding.

If the SD card is missing/distroyed/etc, and i have only the seed phrase, the workaround is to go to ""MyEtherWallet"", give the 12 word seed phrase, and empty that wallet into a new wallet on the android.

It would be easier if we could simply restore the same wallet directly on the android from the seed phrase."

When i open up Lunary, the wallet that was created when i initially ran the app shows my balance--it knows how much eth I've got and the corresponding USD continues to be accurate. So clearly the thing knows how much I've got. However, any attempt to send from that address gives me a notification along the bottom of the UI reading ""can't fetch account balance."" Suddenly I'm at zero eth the moment I try to move it to a more secure wallet where this nonsense doesn't happen. 
Why can't it ""fetch"" my balance when I hit SEND but seems to have fetched it just fine when I look at it?"
manuelsc/Lunary-Ethereum-Wallet,closed,Display Address as ERC-67,[],"Hi, I just implemented main-net support into WALLETH and wanted to try out the interoperability of our wallets - but then I saw you use the following format in the QRCode:

iban:<plain-eth-addres-hex>

I think this is wrong. The only document I found regarding this is: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/ICAP:-Inter-exchange-Client-Address-Protocol 
And I find no mention of the style used in Lunary.

I would propose you use ERC-67 - was also giving some arguments in my talk (http://walleth.org/2017/07/01/WALLETH-talk-video/) why I think this is a good idea.

Would also be OK with ICAP - but imho then this should be in the correct style. But then this also makes intent-filters hard and we would clash with other apps that use iban for other purposes - I would prefer ERC-67"
