geecko86/QuickLyric,open,Show song track title in notification title when available,[],"On (at least Android 8 and 9), the app's name is always on the notifications they are displaying. This makes setting the notification title to the app name redundant.

This change changes the notifications (for both phones and wearables) that relate to music playing to have a title that is the current playing track (as far as QuickLyric assumes).

If the song title is very long (e.g. ""Our Lawyer Made Us Change The Name Of This Song So We Wouldn't Get Sued""), it'll just truncate as it would any way in the fully expanded notification.

is there anything i can do to still be able to save all my lyrics? 

can you maybe add a feature for manually stopping a download, so that it still recognises the lyrics?

geecko86/QuickLyric,closed,Download the lyrics before the overlay is even opened,[],"I would like to suggest the following:
Make like an option on quickLyric to open itself in background when a music app is opened and that closes itself when a compatible music app is closed. Adding to that, the app could fetch the lyrics automatically (without the user clicking the overlay button) so they would be already ready to read. Of course, making it a switch or a check on the settings because of small data plans, so when you install the app its disabled by default. 
This would require a permission to use WiFi and data in background I think, so to don't alarm people that permission acceptance could be triggered when the option is turned on, so users would know why the app is requesting that permission (because of those folks that think that the app is gonna steal information or something because of the internet usage allowance).
Also, and this is like a feature I would love, is, if there's no lyric, the app wouldn't show the overlay button on top of music playing app.
To make the app able to start and stop when a compatible music player is opened and closed, I think that would require like a monitoring service or process that starts with the system on boot. Another permission I think.

I think it would be great to do have that, I think it would turn the app much more easy to use and user friendly, specially if you introduce the automatic online search and not showing the button if there's no lyrics.

I have some very very creative ideas sometimes but I don't even know if all of this is possible, so all I wish is that this helps in future development in some way :)

geecko86/QuickLyric,closed,Romanize asian characters,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The goals is to have a button to convert

* Japanese (hiragana, katakana, kanjis)
* Chinese
* Korean

to the latin alphabet to allow non-native speakers to follow the song phonetically.

[See this tweet](https://twitter.com/QuickLyric/status/862816292188950529).
Japanese speakers will quickly see that this is absolutely wrong. Shame on me, I should've checked.

What happens is that Kanjis are presumed by [xuender/unidecode](https://github.com/xuender/unidecode/) to be Chinese characters that should be transliterated in Mandarin. Therefore, we need a conversion table (a dictionary) from Kanjis to Kana.

* We need it to be of sufficient quality and size for proper transliteration of Japanese music.
* We need it to be as light as possible, so that it doesn't impact the APK size too much. For instance, we don't need a dictionary that converts Kanji to hiargana, katakana *and* romaji. Just one of the three will be sufficient.

Besides size, I have to admit I'm unable say what differentiates [these dictionaries](https://github.com/atilika/kuromoji#supported-dictionaries).

The lightest I was able to find is [nicolas-raoul/kakasi-java](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/kakasi-java), but I was not able to make it work on Android. Nicolas has also worked on [nicolas-raoul/jakaroma](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/jakaroma), apparently it's much better (**how so?**) but also much heavier. I'm also not sure I understand what makes **jakaroma** better than the lib it's based on ([atilika/kuromoji](https://github.com/atilika/kuromoji)).

Finally, an interesting idea would be to rely on a separate APK. That said I'm not sure I would be interested in maintaining such an app given the fact that I do not understand Japanese. QuickLyric would query this ""dictionary app"" via an intent and would obtain a romanized version of the input string."

geecko86/QuickLyric,closed,Use queue for lyrics retrieval,[],"The lyrics retrieval for anything that will update LyricsViewFragment should be in queue of some type, loose `DownloadThread` can cause race conditions.

One easy way to demonstrate is turn on 'Automatically Refresh Lyrics' place

in DownloadThread

and

```
delay -= 5000;

Start program and skip tracks repeatedly from the notification drawer. You will get it turning the LyricsViewFragment to the earlier ones after the later. This kind of thing not unlikely with spotty network access and more likely to happen (and more annoying) with recent tracks addition.

There should be a single queue for retrieving the lyrics from refreshing and recent tracks. I wouldn't trust the http connections to ever return even with a timeout unless I was really familiar with it, I'd have a way to basically abandon the threads and ignore callbacks after my own timeout, otherwise you could get in situation where it simply not refresh anymore, unless the app was force stopped."

If a user changes devices or uninstalls/reinstalls the app for some reason, Google Play will have backed up some of the app data, including whether or not they've seen the intro.

Another possible scenario is people with super low-spec devices who prefer to keep the background service disabled.

**Possible solutions:**

* DIsplay a warning (where?) that says they need to enable the notification access again
* Re-enable the broadcast receiver while notification access is disabled
* Disable Google's automatic backup

geecko86/QuickLyric,closed,Save all spotify tracks instead of just saved tracks,[],"Hi,

A little back story : I use QL to download spotify lyrics from my library and for some reason it was only saving 8 songs always. 
So today I took a look at the code and saw that only the saved tracks are used to fetch lyrics. Not sure how other people use Spotify, but I never save a song. I store playlists for offline use. I imagine everyone doing the same. Downloading the playlist and when you add a song to it, the song gets automatically downloaded. 

So, I am wondering can we download lyrics for all the songs in the users library? It will be a huge number (I know people who have 1000's of songs). Is this feasible to do(api restrictions, too late in the project's timeline etc). If yes, let me know I can do this and submit a PR. Did a dirty version of this, and seems to work. Wanted to ask if this is something you would be interested in or not, before I look more into it. 

Thanks.

geecko86/QuickLyric,open,Listing out provider name rather than genres?,"[Label(name=""fdroid"")]","In my opinion, listing genres will result in some user put focus on wrong target, when they can't found lyrics they want.

I can understand author want to make it as simple as possible, but I think it's gone too far that deciding which provider used for which genres.

1) Most provider have a wide range of genres in their database. If I add another provider similar to LyricWiki, what genres should I tag?
2) It's recommended not to add redundant provider, but what if the only provider don't have a specific subclass? Maybe it's not as popular as others, maybe the artist or album is banned due to some reason, maybe they just forgot it.

Listing genres is a good idea, but it could work as a group and select a bunch of predefined provider automatically. So can user select more when necessary while others don't need to care about it.

And, sorry for my poor English.

geecko86/QuickLyric,closed,Improve lyrics catalog,"[Label(name=""Hi Priority"")]","Some lyrics can't be found. This thread will list songs that QuickLyric couldn't find.
- Please ~~double~~ **TRIPLE** check that you couldn't find a song before reporting such issues with the catalog.
- Please, don't report that ""this Madonna song couldn't be found"". Work on the assumption that if the music is mainstream, it's in the catalog and you're probably doing something worng. Again, triple check before you report such an issue.
1. This issue thread should be used to report certain **patterns**. For instance, if you've noticed that QuickLyric hasn't been successful in finding lyrics for, say, Metal songs or J-POP or Opera (etc.), you can report that QuickLyric needs to improve support for Metal/J-POP/Opera.
2. If you did find a pattern, you can report it here. _Ideally_ you would also indicate a good source (typically a website or an app) that is very good with that specific genre. For instance:
