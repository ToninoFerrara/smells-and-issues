SASAbus/SASAbus,closed,Bug fixes and performance improvements,[],"This pull request includes some bug fixes and performance improvements:

- All maps now default to online OSM tiles if no offline tiles are available. Offline tiles are still preferred to the online tiles to save bandwidth. They can be downloaded by accessing the map page listed in the navigation drawer.
- Fixed a crash in line paths, caused by an invalid custom view
- Fixed a crash in line course, caused by RecyclerView inconsistencies
- Added a link to this GitHub project to the about page
- Updated all outdated dependencies to their latest version"
SASAbus/SASAbus,closed,API Compatibility Issues,"[Label(name=""f-droid""), Label(name=""won't fix"")]","Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.view.ScaleGestureDetector: boolean onTouchEvent(android.view.MotionEvent)>:[8,25]
<android.view.ScaleGestureDetector: boolean isInProgress()>:[8,25]
<android.view.MotionEvent: int getPointerId(int)>:[5,25]
<android.view.MotionEvent: int findPointerIndex(int)>:[5,25]
<android.view.MotionEvent: int getPointerCount()>:[5,25]
<android.view.ScaleGestureDetector: void <init>(android.content.Context,android.view.ScaleGestureDetector.OnScaleGestureListener)>:[8,25]
<android.view.MotionEvent: float getX(int)>:[5,25]
<android.view.MotionEvent: float getY(int)>:[5,25]
<android.view.ScaleGestureDetector: float getScaleFactor()>:[8,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

An event consists of multiple checkpoints where users can go and learn something about the event's topic. There will be attached beacons at every checkpoint of the event. If a user has scanned all beacons he will be awarded with a badge and a QR code. The QR code is used in order to proof the completion of the event to staff members who are handing out gifts to the users who went to all checkpoints.

Bus details show the users which type of bus they have selected. Bus data includes the manufacturer and model of the bus along with the fuel it uses (hydrogen, diesel or methane, in the future electricity might be added). The user additionally has the possibility to report a problem in the selected bus.
### In-app badges

The first two badges the user can achieve are:
- Scanning a bus stop beacon
- Scanning a bus beacon

The completion of these badges is detected by the app itself, unlike the other ones which are handed out by the server upon the upload of the driven trip.
### Favorite lines and bus stops, new list order of driving lines

In case the user does not have any favorite lines or bus stops, the app automatically swipes to the second tab, instead of displaying an empty screen. The order of the driving lines was changed to match the one of the all lines tab.
### Removal of vehicles 257, 263 and 265

These vehicles are no longer in service and have thus been removed.

SASAbus/SASAbus,closed,Added eco points,[],"This commit adds eco points.

Eco points are some sort of ""gamification"", where users can collect points by driving with SASA buses or by earning badges. The users will be displayed on a leaderboard with their corresponding points. Eco points use the beacon technology to track a bus ride and determine the driven meters, which will then result in the rewarded points. Each kilometer will earn you 10 points.

Each user also has to create his own account to be able to participate. Account creation and login will be handled in the app.

Google Analytics can be replaced by the mock Analytics implementation which was previously added by @danielegobbetti with issue #13, but GCM probably has to be replaced entirely by another system to still receive push notifications on F-Droid builds. Also Crashlytics needs to be replaced or removed as it is not open source.
