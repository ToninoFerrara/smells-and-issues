dmfs/tasks,open,OpenTasks loses tasks when force stopped,[],"On OnePlus 6T with Android 9.0 using DAVDroid to sync to a Nextcloud backend.

After a while (no idea how much time it takes though. Definitely hours) the widget will stop showing current tasks. Pressing on the widget will open the OpenTasks app with all the tasks present there, but they will not show up on the widget. The tasks will be there after I recreate the widget but will disappear after a while."
dmfs/tasks,open,RELATED-TO field removed when marking as completed,[],"I use a task manager that has support for subtasks using RELATED-TO. When I mark such a task as completed in OpenTasks, after updating, it turns out the RELATED-TO field has been removed. Can it be that OpenTasks is responsible, or is it the sync adapter? (I currently use DavDroid.)"
dmfs/tasks,open,Request account visibility,[],"Android 8 adds some limitations on account visibility for apps which target SDK level 26+.
In particular an app no longer sees available accounts until it has been granted a certain ""visibility"" on that account.
As a result, OpenTasks now removes task lists, even though the account they belong to still exists.

Sync apps should call [setAccountVisibility](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager#setAccountVisibility(android.accounts.Account,%20java.lang.String,%20int)) for every account they wish to sync to OpenTasks.

We need to decide whether OpenTasks should also ask the user for access to that account. The problem is that we'll have to do that for every account which no longer exists because we won't be able to distinguish between accounts ""invisible"" to OpenTasks and accounts that don't exist without tracking the accounts we have been granted access to."

dmfs/tasks,closed,Fix wrong ID being used. Fixes #723,[],"In an earlier commit we changed how the lists are loaded. Instead of loading them from the tasks table we now load them from the instances table. This was meant to prepare support for recurring tasks.

Unfortunately we missed on line where we were still using the `_id` column to get the task id (when we should actually use the `task_id` column now). This didn't cause any problem as long as the task id and the instance id where in sync (hence it wasn't an issue while testing). However, under certain circumstances this assumption is no longer true and caused an illegal Task URI to be loaded when clicking a task.

The list now uses the `task_id` column to create the task URI to show."

* If all tasks have no starting day and are therefore shown all under ""Someday"" consider hiding the whole ""Tasks starting"" tab, as this only clutters the interface in this case.

* Likewise for ""Tasks due"" - it shows correctly everything under ""Someday"", but if all entries are under ""Someday"" then the ""Tasks due"" tab can be hidden in order not to clutter the interface.

* Likewise, if all tasks have ""no priority"", or have the same priority, consider hiding the  ""Task priority"" tab.

dmfs/tasks,open,Dynamic widget doesn't refresh on Android 8.0.0,[],"On my Huawai P10 with Android 8.0.0 I want to see my owncloud 9.1.6 tasks. Therefore I use the CalDAV-Sync app - version 0.4.32 and the OpenTasks app - version 1.1.13.

When I add the dynamic openTasks widget, the one which I can resize, to a home screen and the tasks are changed I can not see the changes on the dynamic widget.
If I click the widget to open the OpenTasks App, or open the OpenTask app otherwise, the changes are there.
If I add the fixed width and height widget to any home screen, every change is visible."

dmfs/tasks,open,Moving cursor left or right in tickbox items spanning +1 lines moves the cursor back to the 1st line,[],"Hi,
This is possibly the most specific bug I've reported, but I'm hoping it's an easy fix, so even though it's minor, I thought it would be worth reporting.

My version of Android lets me enable left and right arrows to move the cursor around in text (without having to touch the text directly, providing better fine control).

I discovered that when editing a tickbox item in a task, if the item spans more than a line, then moving the cursor left or right moves the cursor one step left or right, but back to the first line.

That's it :)
Thanks!

dmfs/tasks,closed,CardDAV not always synching?,[],"I have several phones and a tablet, and computers (Thunderbird) syncing their addressbooks against an owncloud backend. I have discovered that the phones not always, or it takes several days, to sync updated addressbook information. The phones and tablet settings for CardDAV is set to sync every four hours in both directions.
Is there possibly a bug in addressbook syncing? I have confirmed that both owncloud and Thunderbird contain the correct, updated addressbook information so it seems the problem is on the Android side."

dmfs/tasks,open,"Review dependencies (remove unused ones, remove excludes if possible)","[Label(name=""maintenance"")]","It is possible that there are unused dependency declarations for the modules, find a way to detect them. The `exclude` statements can also be potentially removed due to new gradle system.
---

I've tried the following two tools but neither of them seemed to work for Android project:

nebula-lint
https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin
It could potentially detect everything needed:
https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/wiki/All-Dependency-Rule
The comments about this supposed to be working for Android project or not were contradicting.

dependency-analyze
https://github.com/wfhartford/gradle-dependency-analyze

So at this point I don't know if there is any tool we can use.

---

Specifically about the excludes:

'org.dmfs:android-xml-magic' could be updated to use `implementation` for xmlpull, so this exclude could be removed from here:
```
    implementation(d.xml_magic) {
        // xmlpull is part of the runtime, so don't pull it in here
        exclude group: 'xmlpull', module: 'xmlpull'
    }
```

Worth checking if this has been done:
```
    implementation(d.codeka_carrot) {
        exclude module: 'iterators' // TODO Remove when iterators have been removed from codeka:carrot
    }
```

dmfs androd carrot could be updated with `implementation` for this libraries
```
    implementation(d.android_carrot) {
        exclude module: 'carrot'
        exclude group: 'com.android.support'
        exclude module: 'iterators'
        exclude module: 'jems'
    }
```

Could be checked if it works without the exclude now with new gradle system used supposedly in these libraries:
```
    androidTestImplementation(d.support_test_runner) {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
    }
    androidTestImplementation(d.support_test_rules) {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
    }
```

jems could have `implementation` in contentpal modules (or does it have already?)
```
    androidTestImplementation(d.contenttestpal) {
        exclude module: 'jems'
    }
    implementation(d.contentpal) {
        exclude module: 'jems'
    }
    testImplementation(d.contentpal_testing) {
        exclude module: 'jems'
    }
```"

They are not wired in yet here.

Many additional types, classes have been added for the implementation, to support code re-use and to move towards having every date-time interpretation code/logic defined only at one place in the code base.

There is already a `DateTimeFieldAdapter` for the other type of `FieldAdapter` (org.dmfs.provider.tasks.model.adapters.FieldAdapter) in the codebase, the next step could be to update that with the classes used here, while also reviewing that it interprets date-times the same way.

Notes, questions, comments:

- [x] 1. New classes, types to for jems: `Conditional`, `MapFlattened` (flatmap), `Procedure`
I am going to add tickets and pull requests in jems, we can discuss the names, details there.
-> submitted and listed them for next jems release ticket: https://github.com/dmfs/jems/issues/147
-> they may not be needed after all, just Procedure is used currently (that doesn't required a new jems necessarily)

- [x] 2. Unused classes that used `Time`: `NotAfter`, `NotBefore`, `ShiftIfAfter`, `ShiftTime` - okay to remove them? -> I've removed them, let me know if they should be kept instead

- [ ] 3. Remove the `if start or due then timezone != null` validation in `Validating` allowing floating times? https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/pull/646#issuecomment-359837306

- [ ] 4. General (not provider related) `Single<DateTime>` classes to new datetime module? And separate ticket, once they are settled. https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/pull/646#issuecomment-359857075

.. there are many more questions, general comments, I will put them down later.
I also plan to change some of the new classes, for example to introduce `Evaluated` decorator where `Cursor` is passed in. Also not use that new `ContainerArgument` but the `Single<>` decoration as you did in the provider."

@dmfs It took some time to get everything correctly working here but it looks good now for me.

There is a field in `TaskListActivity` now to save the last used color, so it can be used while the selected task is loaded. It is useful upon starting up the app and after rotation.

`EmptyTaskFragment` also has a hint color now, so we don't change back the color to primary after a deletion but keep it as it was for that task. 

`ViewTaskFragment` can be further simplified after these changes, I've created a separate ticket for that: https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/issues/628

This pull request should fix https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/issues/609 and https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/issues/525, too.

This commit improves the instances view by returning the instance start and due times as task `DTSTART` and `DUE`. This way the UI will see the correct instance times.

This way we don't have to deal with all the old instances of completed tasks. Also some clients seem to support this model only (i.e. Apple clients).
The drawback is, we loose the information about the recurrence, i.e. the current instance would appear as a single task, not a recurring one. One solution to this could be to add a special relation which identifies this task as a part of a recurrence set.

---

I am submitting this now to allow a preliminary check but I will get back to it and have a second look myself as well.

I couldn't reproduce the bug but the stacktrace suggests that it happens after a configuration change / restoration, when the Activity is started and there is already a `ViewTaskFragment` available instantiated by the framework, and we call `loadUri()` on it, and its views are not initialized yet.
It looks like a clear bug that there is no `savedInstanceState == null` check before doing that.

The log I captured for the rotations with the branch `bugs/609-investigation`:
[Tablet-TaskListActivity-Rotation-Fragments.txt](https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/files/1607603/Tablet-TaskListActivity-Rotation-Fragments.txt)

I've added that null check in this pull request. I've also removed the `else` branch there which would remove the fragment in case of single pane mode - which I don't see how could happen. @dmfs Please check that part if you can see any case when that makes sense. Can a two pane mode transform into a single pane one?

I've also done some clean up around and removed unused fields, and created a `Unchecked(Single)` which adapts from `Fragile` to avoid the need to catch checked exceptions for a constructor call in `onCreate()`."

To remove the chance of errors around that and help maintain it more easily, consolidate the solution with the steps below.
---

1. Define the calculation from `DateTime` to `long` at a single place in the code base,
possibly with a `TimeSorting implements Single<Long>` class that takes the start/due `DateTime`. (Or `TimeSortingValue`, `TimeSortingKey`).
    
    Current implementation in `org.dmfs.provider.tasks.processors.tasks.instancedata.Dated` is this:
    ```
    dateTime.isAllDay() ? dateTime.getInstance() : dateTime.shiftTimeZone(TimeZone.getDefault()).getInstance()
    ```
    Consider using `getTimestamp()` instead and consider and test different scenarios (all-day, floating, etc.)

2. Replace every usage of the sorting value calculation in the code base with the new class.

3. Add DB upgrade migration procedure to update all existing values using the new calculation.

4. Revisit `org.dmfs.opentaskstestpal.InstanceTestData` class and its usage in the provider tests. If possible move the sorting value calculation inside.

Before upgrading to target SDK Level 26 we need to figure out a way to handle these changes (probably even before doing so). We only need to read the accounts in order to remove orphaned lists when an account has been removed or a sync app has been uninstalled.

The later case could be handled by checking if there are authenticators for every account in the lists table. That won't solve the account removal case though.

If I understand the changes correctly a sync app could give OpenTasks access by default and OpenTasks would be able to get the accounts without asking the user. If a sync app doesn't do that, the lists might either be removed frequently (like in #404) or lists of removed accounts would not be removed automatically."

dmfs/tasks,closed,"When Adding Items to Existing Checklist, Typing ""Space"" Key Moves the Insertion Point Backwards","[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""opentasks"")]","This behavior only began occurring after the most recent update to Opentasks earlier today, earlier versions worked fine.

When I add an item to an existing checklist by pressing the ""+ Add Item"" button, text entry in the new box works as normal until I enter the first space character.  On pressing ""space"" after entering several characters the insertion point immediately returns to the beginning of the entry, after which spaces work as normal.

dmfs/tasks,open,Show subtasks on details view. #442,[],"
This is far from finalized but I submit it now to get the discussion going.

Questions, notes:

Will using `Tasks.PARENT_ID` be okay for the subtask query?

UI: How should the subtask list look like? Same view repeated, with only the first having the icon, but same spaces between them as with other task details? Or should subtasks be listed within a 'frame' with maybe less vertical gap between them? Use some actual frame lines?
(Current state is just a quick initial setup, not intended to stay like this)

About the loading using RxJava2, I guess there can be many questions there, please check the code and let me know.

I haven't given much thought about packaging the new classes yet, so that's left as well.

Important thing about the loading: currently it is started in `onLoadFinished()` because when it was in `onCreateView()`, the view items didn't show up after loading the screen the second time. Not sure what that was, maybe it's only because `SubtaskView` currently adds the items to a `LinearLayout` and calls `requestLayout()` after it, all within a `ScrollView`, so maybe if that happens before the original content is loaded, then it doesn't work for some reason.

Please check the loading multiple times, it varies greatly for me, sometimes immediate, sometimes delayed compared to the original content.
So unfortunately this multiple loading does add some uncertainty here. As I mentioned before, I think one approach could be to do one loading, so zip/merge the 2 flows together and deliver the results once. That requires to 'Rxify' those loading, if we used Rx for the zip.

A little bit related that compared to current state where loading is handled in the fragment, I think it could actually be nicer to have a custom view for the subtasks (/properties) part that handles loading on its own, when let's say `update(mTaskUri)` is callled on it. But this would mean separate loading.

Please feel free to also comment on specifics already even though it is in initial state."

The majority of all actions is irrevocable (at least as far as it concerns the OpenTasks UI). This Epic will introduce an Undo option for more operations. It should be possible to undo pretty much every operation which modified the database.

The basic idea is to use OpenTasksPal when working with the provider. Every time an operation is created and committed a matching ""undo operation"" is created and stored in a stack (along with a label that describes the operation). That is, when committing an Operation which sets a task to completed, another operation is created which restores status and percent complete and wipes the completed date.
Executing the undo operations from the top of the stack will restore the previous database state.

The undo stack is limited to a specific number of entries and will be cleared whenever the app is closed. So it doesn't need to be persisted.

If an action can not be undone (like when deleting a local list) the undo stack is cleared.

Handling of async changes from other apps (like sync apps) still needs to be defined. I.e. how can we prevent an ""undelete"" of a task if the list it belongs to has just been deleted by the sync adapter?"

dmfs/tasks,closed,Task lists and tasks not cached across app restarts,[],"Hi OpenTasks team,

when I open the 'Tasks' app, tasks and task lists are almost always gone. Waiting for a while or hitting 'Refresh' from the menu brings them back. However, this takes almost a minute until the calendar names are back and then it starts slowly to show one task after another. When airplane mode is active (i.e., no data connectivity to the CalDAV-Server), no tasks or calendar names show up.

This issue persists since I switched to a new phone with LineageOS. I've been using DAVdroid and OpenTasks before on Android 4.2 on an older phone without these problems.

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Manually close Tasks app (or do not use it for quite a while) - i.e., make sure it's not running in the background.
2. Open Tasks app -> No tasks and no calendar names are shown.
3. Hit 'Refresh' (or wait for a long while)
4. Calendar names come back
5. Wait some longer: tasks reappear

### Configuration:
- Motorola Moto G4 Plus
- Android version: 7.1.2
- LineageOS version: 14.1-20170918-NIGHTLY-athene
- OpenTasks version: 1.1.9 (installed via F-Droid)
- DAVdroid version: 1.8.1-gplay

Submitting this now for first check. There are many TODOs left in code.

A few specific notes:
- opentaskpal classes are not reviewed yet
- the contentpal test support ended up being one simple `Matcher` class basically, but I used this `Check` type to implement it and make an adapter for `Matcher`. I haven't thought it through yet since things got much more simple with the `Assert` operations. One thing is that `Matcher` seems not to be completely straighforward for me with the 3 base classes, also I think what we do here is more an execution which can throw Exception than a simple comparison of an already calculated value, so that's why this interface may be better.
We could also forget the hamcrest assert as well, I suppose, to write something like:
```
execute(batch).with(client).andVerifyContent(assertOperations)
```

Implementation may depend a little bit on the eager queue stuff as well.
- not sure where the convenience `Assert*` composed operations should go, to contentpal module or contentpal-testing module
- I've left `AA_TO_*` package names to indicate which module the sibling packages are intended to end up in
- There is one bigger test case left in original form, I will update that, too, so the related private methods can be removed as well
- All test cases are based on the original ones from the old code
- There are possible ways to improve the test code usage, there are some issues to be solved as well (TODOs in code)
- `Assert` for `RowSnapshot` is not available yet, so that will result in changes as well

A new `NotificationSignal` type is introduced to handle this aspect better.
The intent extra indicating that a notification should be silent has been renamed to ""no signal"" along with boolean variables representing it, in order to make it less ambiguous - ""silent"" and especially ""withSound"" can refer to only sound, while as I understand in these cases we need the notification to not signal in any way.

The changes also fix https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/issues/399 by using no signal for pinned notification.

Knows issue:
Task started notification for already pinned task doesn't blink the LED, only plays sound and vibrate (when all is enabled). I don't know why is this, maybe it's a system behavior that updating existing notification doesn't use the lights.
But I suppose it's not that important, let me know if I should look into it, create a separate task maybe."

I used the `getSystemService()` override solution to fix this, `Activity` can provide its reference through that method.

This should fix #384 and #385 as well.

Notes for after reviewing the code:
The 2 Activities that don't extend `BaseActivity` now:
- `DashClockPreferenceActivity extends PreferenceActivity` - I assume `ContextActivity` is not used from within this Activity, so it's okay. By the way, where is this Activity used, how is it started? I don't see direct usage in code, nor intent-filter for implicit intent.
- `ColorPickerActivity  extends FragmentActivity` 'overdefined' in the manifest. No extra code added in this app, so I suppose it's also safe from `ContextActivity` point of view."

I've removed these:

There was a missing, commented out super call in `TextFieldEditor` `onFinishInlfate()`, do you know if there was any reason for that or okay to put it in?

Added a CZ translation here (""few""):
```
    <plurals name=""number_of_tasks"">

        <item quantity=""few"">%d úkoly</item>
        <item quantity=""other"">%d úkolů</item>
    </plurals>
```
Lint said ""few"" is required for CZ, so I checked with Google Translate and it seemed to understand the plurals well, it was different for ""1 task"", ""2 tasks"", ""200 tasks"" with the first and last version corresponding to our existing translation, so I think that ""few"" should be good.

I've also corrected 2 translations in Hungarian.

dmfs/tasks,closed,Add support for recurring tasks,[],"@dmfs commented on [Wed Jun 19 2013](https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks-provider/issues/1)

The task provider needs support for recurring tasks. That is, the instances of a task with `RRULE` or `RDATE` values have to be expanded and stored in the instances table.

If a task has neither a `DTSTART` nor a `DUE` value no instances get expanded.

A second table should contain the completed and the upcoming incomplete instance of a series of tasks. This table doesn't exist yet and needs to be created.

There already is a library to evaluate any `RRULE` values: https://github.com/dmfs/lib-recur

dmfs/tasks,open,Give more information about affected task if validation fails,[],"@korelstar commented on [Mon Aug 22 2016](https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks-provider/issues/8)

`TaskValidatorProcessor` throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if a task does not comply with all constraints. However, sometimes it is not possible to reproduce which task is affected. Therefore, it would be nice, if the exception's message would contain some information in order to identify the affected task, i.e., it's title.

Background and motivation: if there are tasks on a server with `DUE < START` (yes, that is not allowed but some server do not enforce this) and these tasks should be synchronized using e.g. DAVdroid with OpenTasks. Now, the user gets the error message `DUE must not be < DTSTART` but is not able to find out which tasks are affected, without complicated and time-consuming debugging. Extending the exception's message with the task title would be very helpful in order to quickly correct the wrong data on the server.

Thanks for this great app!
I have had a crash for a long time, I've just figured out how to reproduce it \o/
I'm not experienced enough on Android apps (yet?) to be able to fix it, so I rather open an issue

**To reproduce it**
Open the app. Click on a list so that it unwinds, and gives access to the 'quick add' button (the little plus at the right of the screen).
Click this 'quick add' button (not the large, main 'add' floating button at the bottom the screen), and type any name in the Title field.
Click ""Save"", then press the Android home button (timing is important) when the dialog has changed to ""Task created"", but before the dialog has disappeared.

**Expected behaviour:**
Task is saved, and Android leads the user back to the launcher screen

**Actual behaviour:**
Task is saved, Android leads the user back to the launcher screen, but OpenTasks crashes, and Android show the ""Unfortunately, OpenTasks has stopped"" notification.

dmfs/tasks,open,feature Request: Alternate CalDav-Description Rendering,[],"Background: I am using OpenTasks, Davdroid on Android and Thunderbird with Lightning on my Desktop to sync with a Davical-Server.

Most Clients Render the Description of a Tasks as plain text which does not result in a usable Task-Overview especially if the task is more complex. Using OpenTasks with other Clients results in strange plain_text e.g.. OpenTasks uses [ ] and [x] for checkboxes but if one line of the description text contains [ ] OpenTasks will add a [ ] to all following lines so its not possible to to something like:

""my nice description of the task. Do Following:
[ ] text1
[ ] text2
[ ] text 3
and dont forget to do:
[ ] text
[ ] text""

Would it not be a good idea to expect the description field to contain markdown and parse markdown to a UI (e.g. html on client side with [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)) with this approach it is more compatible between clients.

Features needed summarized:
- Add a markdown editor to modify the Task description --> replace description and checkbox field
- Convert markdown client-side to UI e.g. as html
(- additionally it would be nice to weight ""checkboxes"" e.g.
      -[ ]{1} Write this request  -> default
      -[ ]{8} Implement Features
so you can calculate the overall progress with weights.)

Looking forward to a controversy. If the request is excepted I am willing to develop a Thunderbird-lightning add-on so support markdown ( Does not make sense for me atm if there is no android client which supports this feature.)"

The bug now is: When you click on the n'th item in the widget, the editor opens and jumps also to the n'th item. The problem is: Those are not the same items.

Just a note: Rather than syncing the sortings I would prefer some kind of ID, by which the widget identifies the clicked item so that the editor can load the fitting one.

I just noticed a very strange bug. 
I edited the to-do-list of one specific task. 
During that, I switched to another app and / or went back to the task overview (start screen) in OpenTasks. 
During input of text, I wanted to switch to another line of the To-Do-List. An input cursor in the line I wanted to edit did indeed appear, but unfortunately, the input cursor in the line from which I switched away *stayed*. All the text input I made with keyboard unfortunately went to the wrong location: not where I tapped to (second cursor), but where I had tapped before (first cursor). There was no possibility to change the location of the cursor, the cursor always stayed at the one location.

dmfs/tasks,closed,New constraints and defaults (forbid DUE=START),[],"- [x] `CustomizedDefaultFieldAdapter`: Introduce customizable default values (new interface `Default`) in order to provide different defaults for `DUE` (should be after `START`: new class `DefaultAfter`) and `START` (should be before `DUE`: new class `DefaultBefore`).
- [x] New constraint `After`: requires that a value is *after* another value (e.g. `DUE` must be after `START`); if constraint is violated, set value to the default (`DefaultAfter`); similar to the old `NotBefore`.
- [x] New constraint `BeforeOrShiftTime`: requires that a value is *before* another value (e.g. `START` must be before `DUE`); if constraint is violated, then the reference value (e.g. `DUE`) is shifted with respect to the duration of the task.

With the two new constraints, we prohibit `DUE=START` and therefore fix #262. The constraint `BeforeOrShiftTime` is a tradeoff between shifting always (cp. constraint `ShiftTime`) and shifting never (cp. constraint `NotAfter`); maybe this is sufficient in order to close #197."

2. by `PRIORITY` (high priority first, no priority last)
3. by `START` (early start first, no start last)
4. by `CREATED` (new tasks first)

Then, already started tasks are listed before tasks which haven't been started yet, and tasks which have been started a long time ago come before recently started tasks. This helps the user to keep the number of active tasks low in order to concentrate on finishing already started tasks. Furthermore, it allows to influence the order of tasks without `DUE` more fine-grained than using priorities.

If I have a full-day Task for a day far away in the future, this task will be shown. However, the 5-minute Task which comes tomorrow will not be shown.

1. Show check list
2. Show dates (and times)
3. Show detailed progress
4. Show privacy

For each item, I would like to provide a rational that also applies to normal users.
1. The ""Show check list"" will show checklist related controls and info. Not many people use this, so it might be hidden as default, making the app more lighter in use and not bother people with these options if they do not use them. This should also hide/show Tasks due tab.
2. The ""Show dates and times"" or shorter ""Show dates"" will show all date and time related controls and info for start, end and due date and all day and time zone. I know this is supported in VTODO, but some people should be encouraged to use their calendar for date and time related events so it is stored in a VEVENT. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done (What could be offered is a feature to convert a task into a calendar appointment by adding date and time and delete it as a task. Thunderbird offers this for example. For that another feature request should be created.) Hiding and showing thesecontrls and info shoudl also be reflected in the Tasks due and Tasks starting tab.
3. The ""Show detailed progress"" or ""Show progress details"" shows completed date time and percent completed as is now. But when switched off, only shows if a task is completed or not. Simple and what most users probably need.  Hiding and showing these contrls and info should also be reflected in the Tasks progress tab.
4. On ""Show privacy""; privacy is usually covered by the url and credentials of the calendar service being used. Controls and info for this can be hidden by default as well as not many users use this and is only confusing to novice users.

Implementing these features will greatly simplify and improve the user experience for those who do never use certain aspects and/or are easily distracted with too many functions.

dmfs/tasks,open,Installation Error CyanogenMod,[],"Hi,

I am using F-Droid and CyanogenMod (Android 5.1.1). The last update to Version 1.1.8.2 failed with ""Installation Error"" (was no real update a message said i have to reinstall the app). Since then i tried to reinstall manually. I also tried to download the apk file directly from github - same error. I have also tried to update Cyanogenmod. It is not even possible to install an older version of opentasks, wich runs perfectly before.

I'm afraid i cant deliver more information. Is there a way to gather more information during an installaton process? tried catlog.

dmfs/tasks,open,opentasks-davdroid sync error ?,[],"Hi,
I have a owncloud server, and I sync my task list with davdroid (last version from f-droid) - opentasks (last version form f-droid) on my samsung S5mini/Android 4.4.2. It works fine, I'm very happy with it
But there is a strange behaviour when a create/modify a task on my phone. 
Davdroid is configured to sync every 24h and imediately after a modification is made (this second part can't be changed)
When I write some items, and it take a long, I see them disappear. 
I saw that it's happen when a davdroid sync is made. 

Is it a davdroid problem ? A opentask problem ?

dmfs/tasks,open,FR: Change priority without having to open the editor,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Users who make extensive use of priorities may find it annoying that changing a priority takes so many steps (open task, edit task, scroll down, tap priority, select priority, save).

At this time I see 3 options:
1. Allow changing the priority in the details view with a single click and automatically commit changes. This may require some redesign of the details view, also it requires that the priority field is always visible, even for tasks that don't have any priority value
2. Allow to move tasks to a different priority group by using drag'n'drop in the priority tab, the major challenge here is adding drag'n'drop support to the expandable list view
3. Change the ""fling functions"" in the priority tab to ""increase priority"" and ""reduce priority"" rather than ""edit"" and ""complete""

Any other options?

dmfs/tasks,closed,CalDAV tasks without start date but no due date are not shown in widget,[],"Hi,
First of all thanks for your app. I used to use Mirakel with an old version of DAVdroid and it's nice to move to something much more reliable.

I've found that if I don't set a due date on my tasks they also don't show on the widget. Is this by design, and if so can an option be added to modify the display settings for the widget? Considering the requests to modify the way tasks are displayed in the widget, I believe adding options to adjust the widget display is worthwhile.

I'm also looking forward to the addition of alarm editing within the widget.

"
dmfs/tasks,open,Features request,[],"Hi,

I have some suggestions for this great piece of app, if you are interested :)

1 - I use tasks everyday, and to be honest I think there are too much options while creating a task : in my case, but I'm sure I'm not the only one :), I enter the task's name and have to scroll down to set the due date (I have 1280x720 display). I don't use anything else, or rarely.

Could it be possible to have a basic mode when creating the task, with just the name, the due date, the location for example, and eventually a box to hit to expand the advanced mode and access the remaining options ? I think it can not be a general configuration option, as it depends of the task and the needs of the user for each one.

2 - Is it possible to create an event in a specified calendar when creating a task with a start and a due dates ? Or maybe it is already happening, I never checked.

3 - In the widget, could it be possible to have an option to sort the tasks by lists ? I personally prefer the current behavior, but a friend suggested it.

4 - In the task creation/modification screen, I really dislike the current calendar (with the 3 wheels for month/day/year) as I need to scroll again and again... I would prefer a classical one, a small window showing the traditional calendar and allowing me to just ""click"" the day I want. For me, it is faster and easier to visualize (the time/distance between two days, the remaining weeks before the due date, etc). As I know many people like the wheels, could it be an option ?

5 - In the widget, but it depends of the display's resolution and size, is it possible to add a validation button for each task ? The same size than the ""+"" for example ? Because every time I want to set one as finished, it opens the app, I click the button, it backs to an other task (still on the app) and I have to use the back button of Android to return to the widget. So I know the widget is not intended to replace the app, but some small functions like this would speed up my ""workflow"" xD

Thanks for your remarks, I hope I made some interesting points :)

## Prologue

A few days ago, my Nexus 4 with Android 5.1 rebootet automatically into Safe Mode. After another reboot to get back to normal operations, all my custom (non-Google) accounts and widgets were gone (including CalDAV account to sync my calendar and task list). It seems that Safe Mode deletes 3rd party widgets and accounts rather than deactivating them while in Safe Mode.

According to the thread [Accounts/widgets lost in safe mode](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2364444) on the XDA Forums, this is a known bug (at least I'm not the only one). And this problem is easy to solve: Just re-add the accounts and the widgets and everything is restored.
## The actual problem

Before restoring it, I noticed that all the tasks are still in the Tasks app (contrary to the calendar events).

After restoring the accounts, I checked this and all task lists in the app are doubly present (even in the activity **Synchronized Lists**). Hence, all tasks are listed twice, too (in every view). Even if I deactivate (unselect) **all** lists, the _old_ tasks are still listed (only the first view, where all tasks are grouped by list, is empty).

I thought this is a caching problem and get solved after a while, but the old tasks are still visible (and editable). I even pressed a few times `reload` and restartet my Nexus.
## Side note

While readding my caldav account, I selected new and different colors. But I don't think, this is relevant.

dmfs/tasks,open,"Task groups in ""DUE"" tab not updated when date changes","[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi everyone,

I'm running ""Tasks"" on an Xperia Z1 Compact with Android 4.4.4 orignial stock rom and I do experience the following issue: The task groups ""Today"", ""Tommorrow"", ""Soon"", ""Someday"" inside the ""DUE"" tab are not updated when the date changes.

Example: Its Monday and I have three tasks A, B and C on my list. Task A is due today (Monday). Task B and C are due tomorrow (Tuesday). I close the ""Tasks"" app, go to sleep and wake up on Tuesday morning. :-) I open up the ""Tasks"" app to see what's to be done today: Task A is still due today and Task B and C are still due tomorrow, even though they should be due today.

Workaround: Change to the ""PRIORITY"" tab and back to the ""DUE"" tab and tasks get updated correctly.

Question: Shouldn't the update be done directly, when the app starts up or is being re-displayed on the screen after idling in background during the night?

Thanks for having a look at this! :-)

dmfs/tasks,open,Creating a task on Nexus5 looses dates when reading task in SugarCRM (CalDAV),[],"Hi.

I am not sure where the problem is, whether it's in TASKS, CalDAV or Activity Sync - I have to start somewhere finding the issue ... so here it goes.

When I create a task in SugarCRM, the task will show up correctly on my Nexus5 with dates correctly set (and everything else).

When I create a Task on the Nexus5, it will be synced to the Server (SugarCRM running Opacus Activity Sync) meaning it is set in the database as an entry, but it will loose the start and end dates. Because it looses the date/time it will not show up in the task list correcty.

What can I do to help and debug this issue?

dmfs/tasks,open,Hide date and time functionality for GTD,[],"For people who are using Getting Things Done (GTD) time management method, see
also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done, this app very good. However, when using tasks in GTD, these never have a start or due date. Those are destined to be calendar events. I know this is part of the VTODO in iCalendar format and all apps working with it should support it.

If people are never using this, it would be good to have a general option to hide all data functionality in the GUI. It will make the GUI more easy to use and (new) people using GTD will not be tempted to use
dates in tasks while they should actually create calendar events for this. Thirdly, it will make creating tasks faster because you don't need to scroll past the fields for dates to get to the priority setting etc.

See screenshot feature-request-show-date-functionality-GTD.png how it would look if this feature request is implemented. This general setting would also show/hide the DUE and START tabs.

If Tasks is GTD-friendly that could lead to positive publicity in the GTD-community (which is not so pleased with tasks offered by Google, Evernote, etc. that allow deviating from their method) and increase the
number of people using Tasks.

You may ask why not to use 'Today' view for this. Well, pinned notifications allow you to select only relevant tasks for now and do not mix them with other things you need to do today, for example when you get back to office after the running around the town.

I use this app together with Thunderbird's [Lightning v2.6.5](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/projects/calendar/) via various CalDAV servers. Lightning can do a wonderful thing: create recurring tasks, and hide them until their next occurrence after marking them as completed. Not sure how it works on the technical level, but to the user, they are automatically marked incomplete upon the recurrence. Super useful :-)

Unfortunately [Tasks v1.0.8](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.dmfs.tasks) always shows these tasks in the widget as overdue. Because of the limited space on the smartphone, relevant tasks are pushed down the list, often hidden from immediate view.

Please make your app respect the intermittent completeness of recurring tasks and hide them until they are due again.

dmfs/tasks,closed,Feature request: Notifications and the possibility to select (server side) categories for new task,[],"Would be nice if the Tasks app could raise a notification (in the status bar) based on the Start/Due date and time of a Task so i don't need to setup an additional event for a task to get a reminder.

Or maybe something like the Tasks app creates a new appointment in the CalDAV syncronized calender whenever a task with a reminder is created so we can let the native calendar app take care of the notification?

Furthermore the possibility to synchronize all server defined categories (like ""Meeting"" or ""Work"") using CalDAV and make these available in the Tasks app, so the user can select to which category a task belongs instead of having every task in the same list on the server.

CalDAV 0.3.8 w/ Tasks 1.0.6 on KitKat 4.4 Stock
Backend is nginx running ownCloud 5.0.13 on CentOS x64 6.4
