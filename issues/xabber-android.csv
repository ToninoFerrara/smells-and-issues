It's not a big hassle, I'm just wondering why I have to tap on the URL to have it displayed in another app (chrome).
I know that XEP-0363 specifies that just the URL of the sent file is transfered from the sender to the receiver, leaving the task of opening it to the client, so I'm asking if the receiving xabber client can use some kind of ""inline helper apps"" to quickly open the files (e.g. an inline picture viewer for images or a mini-media player for media files).

I have three conference ""rooms"" that I want to be connected to and the xabber app from my Android won't stay connected. I can establish a connection and send a line. It will then give me a ""connection unavailable"" message. BUT, subsequent lines /are/ sent to the conference. It just seems to not know how to stay connected.

Attached is a log. I sanitised it a little.
What do I need to tell our end to correct this?

https://LOCALNAME:5281/DDNSFQDNupload/SLOT/FILE

So I notice the following inconsistencies:

- Xabber is composing the destination URL using the LOCALNAME (e.g. ""server.private"") instead of the ""CUSTOM HOST"" as server address, that is not addressable on the public internet
- Xabber is also adding the DDNSFQDN address (the one set in CUSTOM HOST, e.g. ""server.dyndns.org"") immediately followed by the folder name ""upload"" (missing slash)

Occurs on 453 but didn't occur on 405. I believe the bug is probably related to the new UI design as the person who uses this client never clears their history and after I cleared the history the performance issue went away.

Possible solutions would be adding a setting for how much history can be remember or only loading a page of recent history etc.

**Preamble:** I have a problem of incoming authorization requests spam. Sometimes, their amount gets such requests up to 20 a day. And I have to decline each of them one-by-one from alert-panel (```+``` sign on screenshot). And this is rather annoying.

**Idea:** To create a dedicated list for authorization requests analogically to ```Active chats``` list (see screen).
![img_20171218_181625_929](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7167300/34277151-46a631be-e6ad-11e7-9fe5-2978fca2283b.jpg)

**Common**:
1) If there are no authorization requests (both of counters for incoming and outgoing reqs are = 0), then no authorization requests list to display.

2) Touching on ```+``` sign should open authorization requests list instead of opening each incoming request one-by-one.

**For example**: Authorization Requests (10/1) , where 10 -- number of incoming authorization requests and 1 -- user's outgoing request.

**User's Profit**: In authorization requests list user can:

- accept selected\all requests,
- decline selected\all requests,
- sort requests by time\alphabetic order\type (incoming or outgoing).

Auto-Reject authorization requests from blocked accounts.
 - This way, xmpp spammers won't flood my notification bar, which I can't prevent. Ignoring doesn't help, since the same request will reappear over and over again. If a contact is blocked they shouldn't be able to continue spamming and bothering the person that blocked them.
- Currently, I get bothered each few mins with the same request, making any notification from Xabber almost always a waste of time and annoyance.

Block all messages and/or authorization requests from specific servers.
- This is kinda emergency solution, as xmpp-spamming in combination with inband registration allows spammers to circumvent blockades.

Reason:
XMPP Spamming really gets out of control, and while it is not as heavy as eMail Spams, it's worse due to absence of minimalistic features to combat it on clientside. It's frustrating and annoying, espechally when users need to be online.

I can only get the avatar to update if I manually open the contact and open the 'Contact Info' pane, or if I clear the Xabber app data and re-add my account, causing all my contacts to be re-populated.

Xabber logs show that the VCard is being requested and sent, but for whatever reason it's not updating the UI or not detecting the new VCard. The logging isn't verbose enough to tell me exactly what is happening in Xabber code though.

I want to know more details about that:
* Who and why blacklisted DIGEST-MD5 mechanism? 
* Blacklist is stored in Xabber client or in 3rd party lib (smack/android)?
* How can I remove DIGEST-MD5 from blacklist? (I know it is not good idea, but I have no chance to 
change server configuration).

Thanks!

I understand that you removed the capability of being able to create an XMPP account from Xabber because some servers do not support it and it causes confusion to some users.Yet this will require that some users will need another XMPP client just to create an account for the first time, eapecially that some servers (such as rows.io) don't support web registration. @andrew.nenakhov suggested adding a hidden option to enable inband registration."

This is serious security flaw as once stored on device, information can be recovered later by scanning with special software.

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,"Resolving SRV DNS record fails, no retry -> cannot connect to A record",[],"Hi,
I had some trouble with reconnections when roaming or switching from wifi to mobile in Xabber 2.0.1! Maybe you can use the information to improve the connection handling in Xabber.

Setup: 
- Prosody 0.9
- Xabber 2.0.1 on Android 6, using Java DNS resolver
- SRV DNS record for the XMPP server
- A record to another server (which is a web server)

Problem: when wifi drops and Android switches to mobile, the DNS server of my provider fail to resolve the SRV record (edit: it fails, because the connection fails, see comment below). Xabber then tries to reconnect to the A record, and obviously fails. Same problem happens while roaming when the connection must be reestablished.

What I tried: I looked into Prosody first, but it's not a server issue. Then I looked into Xabber, which led me to Smack - nothing suspicious. I analysed Xabber logs and compared them with logs from logcat and could pin the problem to DNS.
```
2017-04-19_17-05-23 D/org.jivesoftware.smack.util.DNSUtil Could not resolve DNS SRV resource records for _xmpp-client._tcp.<domain>. Consider adding those.
2017-04-19_17-05-23 D/org.jivesoftware.smack.tcp.XMPPTCPConnection Trying to establish TCP connection to <domain>/<ip_of_webserver> at port 5222
```
```
2017-04-19_17-05-53 W/ConnectionThread: <user/resource>: org.jivesoftware.smack.SmackException$ConnectionException: The following addresses failed: '<webserver>:5222' failed because: <webserver> exception: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: failed to connect to <webserver> (port 5222) after 30000ms
```
There's no problem with the record, since everything works when starting Xabber while a stable connection exists (stable mobile, wifi). I have now pointed the A record to the XMPP server as well, so people don't get mad :smile: 

- So maybe you could improve requerying the SRV record when it fails? 
- Or add a delay for DNS queries when reconnecting to make sure a stable connection to the providers DNS server is established?
- I know this is more a Smack problem, but why does a DNS query happen if the TTL cannot yet be expired? If I connect via the SRV record, and reconnect, why does it not reuse the cached SRV record?

Thank you guys for the update to Xabber 2.x, I really enjoy the UI with the new features!"

But there can be of course other errors, e.g.:

RECV (2): <iq id='Bf77q-515' type='error' to='alice@domain.tld/xabber' from='domain.tld'><error type='modify'><bad-request xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/><text xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'>MIME type does not match file extension</text></error></iq>

In that case, the message ""MIME type does not match file extension"" is more useful than ""... Too large?"".

edit:
A disadvantage would be, that if the string is taken from the server response, it cannot be translated.
IMHO a concrete error message in the wrong language is better than a general, perhaps misleading one.

I am running a private XMPP server (prosody) behind my router and cannot use Xabber to transfer files. The issue is, that Xabber is trying to establish a connection to the local IP or the ""virtual host"" (e.g. 192.168.1.1) on port 5281, instead of connecting to the custom host that I've specified. I guess that file transfer works just fine, if you provide your server's domain name, but as I mentioned I do not have a dedicated domain and use my router's public IP as host. Is the way that the XEP-0363 handles the file transfers compatible with my configuration at all? Should the client connect to the custom host, or to the server when file transfer is initiated? I've read that you are planning to release an update soon, could you please review this issue, in case that it is a Xabber related one?  I am also curious whether you plan a future support for Jingle (I saw a probably abandoned fork on GitHub). Thank you in advance ! "

Summary
-------

An incorrect implementation of XEP-0280: Message Carbons[0] in multiple
XMPP clients allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user, including
contacts, in the vulnerable application's display. This allows for
various kinds of social engineering attacks.

Details
-------

The XMPP protocol extension ""XEP-0280: Message Carbons""[0] allows
a user to run multiple clients on their XMPP account by sending ""carbon
copies"" of outgoing and incoming messages to the user's other devices
(besides the one that directly sent or received the original message).

This feature must be supported by the user's server and must be
explicitly enabled by the client. Carbon copies are always generated by
the user's server and originate from the user's bare JID (their account
address).

For example, the following is message ""Hi!"", sent by Alice
(`alice@xmpp.example`) to Bob's client 1 (`bob@xmpp.example/client1`):

        <message from=""alice@xmpp.example"" to=""bob@xmpp.example/client1"">
            <body>Hi!</body>
        </message>

Bob is also logged in with carbons-enabled client 2, which receives the
following carbon-copy of the message:

        <message from=""bob@xmpp.example"" to=""bob@xmpp.example/client2"">
            <received xmlns='urn:xmpp:carbons:2'><forwarded
xmlns='urn:xmpp:forward:0'>
                <message from=""alice@xmpp.example""
to=""bob@xmpp.example/client1"">
                    <body>Hi!</body>
                </message>
            </forwarded></received>
        </message>

Now, client 2 can extract the original message from the carbon copy and
display it accordingly. The ""Security Considerations"" section of
XEP-0280 explicitly states that:

| Any forwarded copies received by a Carbons-enabled client MUST be from
| that user's bare JID; any copies that do not meet this requirement
| MUST be ignored.

The Carbons implementation in the affected clients was lacking this
test. It simply checked all incoming messages for presence of a Carbon
element (`<received/>` or `<sent/>`), extracted and parsed it like a
regular message.

Therefore, it was possible for Mallory to send the following specially
crafted message to Bob:

        <message from=""mallory@evil.example"" to=""b@xmpp.example"">
            <received xmlns='urn:xmpp:carbons:2'><forwarded
xmlns='urn:xmpp:forward:0'>
                <message from=""alice@xmpp.example""
to=""bob@xmpp.example/client1"">
                    <body>Please come to Creepy Valley tonight,
alone!</body>
                </message>
            </forwarded></received>
        </message>

This would appear as an authentic message from Alice, including Alice'
proper screen name, allowing Mallory to perform social engineering
attacks on Bob.

Mitigation
----------

While the attacker can send messages in the name of somebody else, they
can not see your responses. Therefore, if you receive a phony message
while using an affected client, reinsure with the message sender by
either challenging them with a question that can not be guessed by the
attacker, or by using out-of-band means.

Xabber: disable the experimental Carbons feature in the app settings.

yaxim: Disabling Message Carbons under ""Settings"" / ""Edit account"" /
""Message Carbons (XEP-0280)"" will not solve the problem, as the
malicious messages still will be interpreted.

As far as I can tell it happens with all HTML entities if the conversation is private and only on xabbers side. Pidgin shows them just fine when sending a otr message from xabber.  
It doesn't happen when sending from xabber to xabber so maybe it's a bug in pidgin or pidgin-otr.

The tests:
1. Caught pidgin sending the same stanza
2. Was done with a just-installed Xabber that never had sent messages to that user
3. Only showed one message stanza: the one with the message itself. There was no preceding message stanza with the <composing> tag

The strophe.js code that does I used for testing:
function pega(stanza) {
  if ( stanza.getElementsByTagName('composing').length > 0) {
    console.log('composing');
  }
  if ( stanza.getElementsByTagName('composing').length === 0) {

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,Proposal for beating WhatsApp and supporting open communication,"[Label(name=""Suggestion""), Label(name=""rejected"")]","Also see https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1802

This is not an issue in the existing version - more a proposal how we may get Jabber/XMPP to become a **real** alternative to WhatsApp, since I fear that people now think WhatsApp is ""good"" and ""secure"" as it introduced end-to-end-encryption. But with WhatsApp people are still depending on one single company - Facebook. And this should not continue like this. But just telling people, they should move to Jabber doesn't really help since many users find Jabber too complicated and only suitable for ""tech-savvy geeks"".

_What makes WhatsApp so popular?_

Well - you don't need to create any account using a username/password and you don't need to know the account names of your friends - their phone numbers are enough to check, if they use WhatsApp as well and to reach them. And as you already have the numbers in your phonebook you literally can start to chat with your friends instantly after installing WhatsApp.

_How to achieve the same goal with XMPP/Jabber?_

My idea:

1) Offer to enter an existing account OR to create an account using one of several well known Jabber providers (e.h. jabber.org, jabber.de etc.) with a password which is automatically created locally and which can be displayed or saved for later reference. The list of providers could be loaded dynamically from a server (see point 3) where providers could register their service.

2) Detect the local phone number and/or allow the user a way to enter and confirm it manually.

3) Provide an online service for a central registry where the client can send the hash the telephone number together with the Jabber-ID.

4) Offer a function where the use can look up existing (hashed) phone numbers at the central registry to see, if others in his addressbook already use the service and if yes which Jabber-ID they have - so you can easily get in touch with others without the need of manually exchanging Jabber-IDs.

I'm aware, that the central registry may be seen as ""evil"" - but this should be implemented as open source and should be run by a non profit organisation. To cover the cost for the servers, backup, maintenance etc. one could either rely on donations or ask for a yearly usage fee by the users with the first 1 to 3 months for free - if a user decides not to pay, the registered hash gets locked with a status ""user does not want to use the service any longer"", so others will not find it any longer. However - communication is still possible, as the central registry is only needed to find others more easily, not for the communication itself. Of course you still can contact Jabber-IDs directly without using a registry server.

It's only a very rough proposal and there may still be things I forgot - but what do you think? Does this sound interesting? Did anyone try this yet?

I've been a professional software developer for the last 20+ years (see [http://arnowelzel.de/wp/en/about-me](http://arnowelzel.de/wp/en/about-me)). I have experience in Android development as well as in running and maintaining Linux servers (I run my own Jabber server as well as a number of domains and services for friends and family members) - so I can help wherever needed. But I don't want to do this without the support of others.

It then hints but doesn't come right out and say that you need to send `<status code=210>` embedded in the self-`<presence>` stanza to enable this. Because it doesn't say it outright, it might be correct to interpret it this way: the `<status code=110>` stanza tells you your current nick.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,How to proper delete downloaded images,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Xabber Beta 1.0.74

I just noticed the ""SD Card/Xabber/Cache/"" directory on my phone. When Xabber automatically downloads images in a chat, they are saved to that directory.

But even if I delete the whole message history, the downloaded images remain in that directory.

I also tried ""Debug Settings - Delete cache"". All history etc. is gone, but the cached images remain.

What is the proper way to completely delete images from a chat & sd card?

I found very old images from months ago there. That indicates, that there is no clean up routine or something.

Thanks in advance for any hints.

I encounter also a problem with that: Alice sends an image (URL) to Bob. Bob's Xabber downloads that image and displays it in the chat window. Alice replaces the original image with another one but keeps the same file name / url. Alice sends the URL again to Bob. Bob's Xabber will display another image in the chat window, but unfortunately the one downloaded before and not the new one.

URL could be something of http://example.com/image-of-the-day.jpg

Xabber has the same system: ""use a persistent notification to keep the program in RAM"", but it seems to be using a different system for this, one which is arguably less suitable for an always-running background messaging service:

but only test3 was joined from Xabber. The other two Xabber didn't know about until it got these messages. What Xabber does then is show the two unknowns as if they were regular direct message contacts. Xabber seems to be ignoring the 'groupchat' key, and instead using an internal lookup table to decide whether something is a conference or not.

Your behaviour here is like https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1687 and https://github.com/boothj5/profanity/issues/731, yet different. It seems that, unlike those two, you catch the initial <presence> with <status code=110> and spawn a room. So this weird case of getting messages from rooms you haven't joined only happens in degenerate situations with lazy transports. But you should still be checking the message type!

## Actual result

When selecting text to cut or paste, the cut/paste banner comes down, but all the icons (except the confirmation checkmark) are white on a white background. The options are still available if you know where to tap.

What this amounts to is that messages aren't sent correctly, and the receiver of the incorrectly encrypted messages does not receive them but instead receives a perpetual ""the other person is typing"" message. Furthermore, Xabber does not seem to re-establish an OTR session when the other person switches clients mid-conversation (i.e. the other person starts chatting from a desktop computer, and later switches to a mobile client during the same conversation).

I also removed the unnecessary cast from `AbstractXMPPConnection` to `XMPPTCPConnection` because we actually do have a `XMPPTCPConnection` here and I see no reason to cast here. Feel free to prove me wrong.

In my second commit, I have sorted the list of supported XEPs which is not really in the scope of this PR. I usually don't like sidetracked changes like this, but I think it really improves readability... Feel free to complain, I'll happily remove this commit if needed.

- Do not to encode any semantics into the resource, let the server generate a resource for you
- Show the type and name of a resource (mobile, pc, home, work, etc.) by means of Service Discovery and not the resource string itself. Also set meaningful 'identity' information yourself

I'm not actually sure if Xabber already sets the XEP-30 identity or does display the identity of other entities. If not, it should do so.
Also Xabber should provide a option to let the server assign a resource and probably default to this.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Addressbook integration,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","It would be very useful to get integration with Android addressbook.

What that means:
- XMPP accounts are listed in the **""Accounts"" list in Android**. It's already possible to add an XMPP account this way, but you can't see the existing accounts.
- XMPP contacts appear in the **addressbook** as individual contacts. Of course Android allows you to merge contacts together, so you have 1 entry point to join someone no matter if it's by a phone call, SMS, Telegram message, XMPP message, etc.
- The XMPP buddy's avatar can be used as the **Android contact's picture**.
- Android addressbook also has a concept of **groups**, which maps perfectly to XMPP groups.

Why is that interesting for the user?
- You can see your XMPP accounts where all the accounts are.
- One place to reach your friends without having to know which app to open.
- You can place a shortcut to your friends on the home screen.
- Xabber could offer to choose which name to display: roster or addressbook.
- Your XMPP groups are preserved in the addressbook, so you can e.g. filter which groups to show in the addressbook.

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,feat(MUC): Add Preference to Suppress XEP Status Code 100,[],"XEP Status Code 100 tells the XMPP client application, that a room is not
anonymous, which means that JIDs of all members are revealed.

Unfortunately, XEP states, that the Server should send an body together
with the status code, containing 'This room is not anonymous'.

Extract from XEP 1.24:

```
Example 24. Service Warns New Occupant About Lack of Anonymity

<message
    from='darkcave@chat.shakespeare.lit'
    to='hag66@shakespeare.lit/pda'
    type='groupchat'>
  <body>This room is not anonymous.</body>
  <x xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user'>
    <status code='100'/>
  </x>
</message>
```

Therefore each time a user enters a non-anonymous room he receives a
message containing ""This room is not anonymous"".
A problem with this is the fact, that this happens with every reconnect
of the mobile connection. For each room with every internet change (WiFi
to mobile or vice versa, or just unstable internet) one'll get a
notificaton.

To stop this from happening I added an Option to the Chat-Room-Settings,
which allows to suppress this messages. This way users can suppress them
for the rooms they don't need this notificaton.

### What's Xabber?

Xabber is an **open-source XMPP messenger for Android platform**. It is built around open standards, interoperability, design and user experience. Xabber supports many popular XMPP extension protocols, Off-The-Record Chat Encryption and is available in multiple languages.
### Wait, what's XMPP?

**Note**: I've used the [xmpp.org definition](https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/), which I think it's more official.

The **Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol** (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.

The protocol was originally named **Jabber**, and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging (IM),presence information, and contact list maintenance.
### Why should I use it?

XMPP is **highly extensible**, via extensions known as XEPs (XMPP Extension Protocol). Xabber supports a number of popular XEPs that are essential to providing great chat experience for our users.

Although the core technology is **stable**, the XMPP community continues to define various XMPP extensions through an open standards process run by the XMPP Standards Foundation. There is also an **active community of open-source and commercial developers**, who produce a wide variety of XMPP-based software.
### Why should I trust Xabber?

Xabber is **free software**, so the code it's totally open and everyone can see, modify and distribute it as they want. It's also economically free, so **you'll never have to pay for it** and it's advertisements-free. Xabber also allows us to **encrypt our messages** by using the Off-The-Record (OTR) Chat Encryption. But one of the best reasons is because it uses XMPP, which allows you to use the server that you most like so you have **total and real privacy**.
### How can I contribute if I'm a developer?

Xabber was originally developed by [Redsolution, Inc.](http://www.redsolution.com) — an international software and services company based in Russia and United States. Xabber was licensed under GNU/GPL v.3 license early in 2013. Since then, a number of individuals joined Xabber as developers, testers and translators.

Our goal is to create a stable, reliable and user friendly ecosystem for instant messaging that does not rely on proprietary services. We welcome anyone who believes in open standards and free information interchange to take part in moving Xabber forward.

Visit [our website](http://www.xabber.com/), send us an email to info@xabber.com and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xabber_xmpp) and [Github](https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android).
### What if I'm not a developer?

Xabber is available in multiple languages thanks to many fine people from all over the world. We have created a [special page](https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android/wiki/Top-translators) on our website to acknowledge their efforts.

You may join their ranks and help us improve translation quality by [contributing](https://crowdin.com/project/xabber/) your translations to Xabber project.

I've thought in adding a check item to the roster menu (up/right) or the Recent chats list, the Chat settings or wherever you prefer to include this option with the sentence ""keep open the latest conversations"". So it would automatically load the latest chats and keep them open until the user uncheck this option.

Why? because when we share a room ID, we write just _`name-of-the-room@conference.jabber.org`_ instead of _""In the server `conference.jabber.org`, the conference `name-of-the-room`""_, so IMO sounds more logic to input first the name of the room and later the server.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,A few changes in the chat menu: no export/show history and add a local searcher and a muter.,[],"I want 2 things in the menu: a local searcher and a contact muter but the menu already has a lot of items so, in order to introduce these 2 features, I think it should put off 2 others items, so I thought: 
- Export chat: I think that it should be done automatically instead of manually (the user could choose an hour to do it or every X time, eg.: everyday at 4am or every 8 hours).
- Show history: maybe it should be loaded by scrolling down (even if there's no text), so Xabber detect it as a petition for more history, so it should load more messages, but just scrolling, no buttons at all. I.e. my definition of scrolling is: pushing the screen and holding it while the finger go down.

The local search just would search in the loaded history of the conversation and the contact muter (input time / until new advise (just like conversations does)) could be also configured in the chat settings.

Please, read [this Conversations issue for more information about it](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/69), specially [this message](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/69#issuecomment-49864163):

> I like to have pictures of my contacts. In fact this is pretty much the reason Conversations had contact list integration from day one.
> I see that adding every jabber contact to your address book might not be a viable option. So I had another, closer, look at the XEPs.
> 
> XEP-0153 is the most widely adopted. Unfortunately it's complete garbage. It's not even a proper XEP (as in proposed to become a standard). It's just a write down of what legacy clients did in the past. Images can only be stored in base64. It limits the size to 8KB (which after base64 becomes 32KB + vcard overhead (one always has to download the entire vcard)). The image size is recommended to be 64px and should max out at 96px.
> The avatars in Conversations (in the Conversations overview) are, depending on your phones dpi 128px or even larger. So this will basically look like crap.
> One has to fetch ones own vcard/avater on every login which on mobile is without stream management can become very very traffic intensive.
> 
> XEP-0008 shares a lot of problems with XEP-0153. The only benefit is that one doesn't have the vcard overhead (which isn't that huge). Plus the adoption rate is lower afaik.
> 
> XEP-0084 does a very good job on separating meta data and the actual images. One doesn't have to download ones image on every login but just check the meta data. XEP-0084 can handle multiple images in multiple formats and resolutions. So we could offer a general purpose JPEG image in a generic solution (lets say 96px) and a higher res webp image (which is awesome at high compression rates) especially for Conversations. Plus XEP-0084 allows images to be stored on a HTTP server as well. This could work around the base64 problem. (However this is optional)
> 
> On the downside the adoption rate of XEP-0084 is lower and it requires the server to support PEP. But a low adoption rate hasn't botherd Conversations in the past if it was the better solution.
> 
> **TLDR**: XEP 0084 is pretty much the only reasonable one to use. In contrary to what i said before PEP (as opposed to pupsub) is actually designed to work with IM.

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,Correctly use SRV specified hostname for cert validation (#204),[],"Initially the XMPPTrustManager queried getServiceName from the
ConnectionConfiguration and used that for certificate validation. This is a
bug, because the serviceName corresponds to the hostname of the jabber id. That
is, if we're trying to connect for account foo@bar.com it corresponds to
bar.com.

However, we are properly doing a SRV lookup to see which server hosts the
actual XMPP server for bar.com, which may be on a different hostname. For
example, everyone hosting their XMPP at fastmail.com will have their XMPP
server on chat.messagingengine.com. The XMPPTrustManager will then try to
verify the server's certificate of chat.messagingengine.com against the bar.com
it expects, which will obviously fail. This issue renders it impossible for
anyone using a 3rd part XMPP server to connect to their account.

The correct approach is to use the hostname returned by the SRV lookup as the
hostname checked by XMPPTrustManager. That is, if our SRV lookup for bar.com
returns chat.messagingengine.com as the XMPP server, we should validate that

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,Vague failed connection errors,[],"When trying to connect to a Jabber server through Tor, Xabber seems to crash Orbot. That's a different, larger issue, though, and one that I want to look into more before reporting.

More generally, it would be nice if failed connections came with more specific information. For example, ""proxy refused connection"", ""domain name resolution failed"", ""TLS connection failed"", ""server refused connection"", etc. The kinds of things Firefox might tell you.

I think this is reasonably important because many users don't have enough experience to do blind connection diagnostics and will pretty quickly switch to another client if one is mysteriously failing.

Let me know if I'm missing a log somewhere that saves this information. In that case, though, I think it would still be valuable to persistently show the reason for connection failure in the main window.

Thanks for your time.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Carbon Copy confuses other clients and causes resent messages,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","The new (and automatically activated) feature for Carbon Copys (XEP-0280) is causing some unexpected trouble...
When Carbon-copy is enabled, I can't predict and control, where the messages from my contacts will be delivered to, It depends on the client AND the server of the contact.
It seems like some clients and servers are confused by the messages like
    `<message from=""me@my.server/Xabber"" type=""chat"" to=""you@your.server/Whatever"" id=""1BOWU-36"">`
    `<active xmlns=""http://jabber.org/protocol/chatstates""/>`
    `</message>`
which causes them to send the messages directly to `me@my.server/Xabber` instead of sending just to bare jid or looking at the Priority (Xabber has -1, PC has 50). But that is just a guess.

The other problem is, if I send a message from Xabber in a chat CCed from the PC, Xabber will resend all messages previosly from the PC to the contact. Some clients seem to notice this, others display them again..

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,"1.0.2: 3 issues with ""Export chat"" functionnality","[Label(name=""bug"")]","# TL;DR

""Export chat"" basically works, but there are 2 issues that break Xabber along the way, and in the end some content is not saved properly.
# Device
- [HTD Desire HD](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_hd-3468.php)
- [CyanogenMod 11 M12](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2533007)
# Steps to reproduce
1. Make sure you are logging chats on your device  
2. Update Xabber from 0.9.30f to 1.0.2 via F-droid
3. Tap on the name of a user to access the chat window
4. Call up the option menu
5. Select Export Chat
# Issue 1: cut/paste menu design issue
## Actual result

When selecting text to cut or paste, the cut/paste menu comes down, but all the icons are white on a white background. They are still functionnal if you know where to press.
## Expected result

When selecting text to cut or paste, the cut/paste menu comes down, icons should be a different color from the background they are on
# Issue 2: Xabber crashes upon exporting
## Actual result

When confirming the name of the export, an Android window appears to inform Xabber has crashed. If you press OK quickly, the save is not carried out. If you wait 10 to 15 secondes before dismissing the window, the chat is properly saved.
## Expected result

Xabber should not crash upon exporting a chat.
# Issue 3: Issues with parsing & conversion to HTML
## Actual result

newlines in messages are exported as simple spaces.
""<"" and any character following it in a message are not exported. Ie, when I text my girlfriend ""I <3 sexy babe"" (don't judge me), only ""I "" is exported.
## Expected result

newlines in messages should be exported as `<br />` like in 0.9.30.
""<"" should be exported as `&lt;` like in 0.9.30, and the text following it should be exported.
# The final word

- It assumes that if the user is using a SOCKS5 proxy, then the user would always want to remotely resolve the DNS using that proxy (ie. not using the DNS configured for the device), I'm not sure if this is always a correct assumption. A configuration option could be added here, but that would add another column to the 'accounts' table, I'm not sure if that would break data compatability when upgrading old installations of Xabber. Another solution that this configuration option could be global (ie. not account specific), so it would be in the shared preferences.
- This still leaks the SRV DNS request to the DNS configured for the device (that is if the user chose to use SRV record instead of manually setting the host). There is no solution for that one, except that the user would use something like Orbot's transparent proxy feature, and this requires the device to be rooted.
- If the SOCKS4 implementation in SMACK library is for SOCKS4a, then we can also add a condition to use SOCKS remote DNS if proxy type is SOCKS4.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Xabber displays empty messages in OTR sessions with Pidgin (or libotr based?) clients,[],"When a Xabber user sends an encrypted message to a Pidgin user, the pidgin client then seems to send some response (maybe an acknowledgement?) that Xabber parses as an empty text and displays it as such in the chat view. This happens if the OTR session is initiated by Xabber.

Actually, this also happens when the pidgin user ends the OTR session (or quits) regardless of which client initiated the OTR session.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Messages don't show up,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hey
I had a [problem with a client](https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js/issues/353#issuecomment-90523050) and an other user told me, that he had the same problem with your client.

Xabber doesn't show messages, if the ID generated by the client isn't unique. The jabber client on lima-city is fixed now and uses the timestamp as ID. But other Clients like Pidgin can show the messages, no matter what the ID is. And Xabber shows them even, if there is no ID at all. You might want to fix that.

```
#Pidgin

#jabber.lima-city.de

if you start typing a message in one chat, then swipe to another, you see that chat with opened keyboard but input field gets no focus. 

This happens even with recent chats tab.

Correct solution to this issue would be to keep separate keyboard/ inputfield state for each active chat. So, if we swipe to chat that didn't have keyboard open, we shouldn't open chat there. If we typed some text, didn't finish it, swiped, then got back - we should be able to resume from the same place where we left.

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,xabber locks my account immediately after password change,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Scenario:  My corporate XMPP server requires frequent password changes... I am forced to change it there first... if I do not disable the profile in xabber, it will immediately cause my account to be locked because it re-try's logon repeatedly even if the logon information is bad.   

Assumption: This assumes the XMPP protocol / server provide some level of detail on why the logon failed - I admit I don't know much about that protocol.

Suggested Repair: During logon attempts; xabber should evaluate the response from the server.  In the event the server replies with a logon failed message, xabber should stop attempting logon / disable the account in the client and notify the user of an issue.  [this could be setup as a user select- able option too]

Clarification: In the event the server can't be reached due to network issues, or if the server replies with messages indicating it is busy or whatever, it makes sense to continue attempting logon; but it should not continue if there is indication of bad logon credentials by the server.

thanks,
bruce

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,bad choice: OTR notifications do pop up in background only,[],"Hi,

all notifications of the xabber-client do pop up in the android notification area. I think it would be better (e.g. for OTR-authentification) if they would pop up directly in the xabber-application. If you are new to the client, a background-notification on OTR-auth is really not obvious!

We shall make things as easy as possible for unexperienced users, most importantly OTR!

The other contact is in  my brothers friendlist too and has no xabber, just the facebook chat client.
My brother and me we both have Xabber (dev-version actual).
There is no open chat in the xabber chat list with this other contact.
I don't understand at all why Xabber starts chatting and sending OTR messages to this contact, must be a bug which happens only in seldom circumstances.
This other contact is totally annoyed and is nearly dropping us out from her contact friend list in facebook (or set us to ignore) which I don't want.
I have a SGS2 with CM 10.2.1 and my brother has some cheap tablet with Android OS 3 something.
We both have OTR mode ""Always"" or ""forced"" (not ""automatic""), but as I said, there is no previous conversation running to that other contact. Only when I start with my brother, xabber starts to send enrypted messages (I don`t know what) as well to this other contact.
Maybe it is working if I set OTR to ""automatic"", but I need to be sure, I only want to use OTR.

Anybody knows what this bug could be?
Thanks

The first notification is from Hangouts.
The second notification is from Xabber.

Btw all notifications for this contact in Xabber are disabled, because I'm using Google Hangouts app to talk with him.

There is a settings menu for this contact.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Add ability to stop Xabber from auto-reconnecting when it is disconnected due to a resource conflict,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello,

Xabber currently doesn't have an option in its ""Connection settings"" to stop it from auto-reconnecting when a resource conflict is detected. This is necessary when a company has an old jabber server which doesn't support priorities. As a workaround, It is nice to be able to set the resource in two devices to be identical and let the last connected device kick the other one out via resource conflicts. The kicked (last) device should stay disconnected and provide the user with an option to easily reconnect when they decide to further down the line.

Pidgin on the desktop does this. When pidgin's jabber session gets kicked due to a resource conflict, it will disconnect and will say:

""1 account was disabled because you signed on from another location."", after that there is a button that says ""Re-Enable"" which will reconnect to the session when clicked.

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,data is not erasable,[],"Hi, Thanks for making xabber available still on the earliest android phones.. I'm proud to have a still working G1 with xabber on it, using otr etc. But it only has very little space for applications: about 100 meg in all, as it's such a prehistoric phone (5 full years old!). Xabber seems to accumulate data, and is now consuming 14m of data and also has a section where normally you can delete  cache, but whenever I look there is never any cache I can delete, there is always more data, and I can't delete just the data. The data should just be the message history or things like that.. Maybe contact lists.. All stuff I can get again. How can I add a bit of code to xabber to make it possible to clear this data?

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,Certificate verification with trusted private CA fails,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Xabber rejects as untrustworthy the certificate chain from my server.

My server uses a certificate from my own CA; as well as DANE trust anchors in DNS, which I don't expect to be usable with Android, I have my CA as a ""Trusted credentials""/""User"" such that KitKat keeps complaining about the presence of the CA. So I'm highly confident that it's present in the system trust chain.  Android 4.4.2 on Nexus 4, build KOT49H.

Using a browser to visit web-sites with certs from my CA works.  If Xabber could either trust the CA, or at least detect it and say ""Hey, we don't know the CA this is using, but the CA is on your system; it's FooBarBaz; want to trust it for this account?"" then this would be more usable.

Thanks for your hard work on Xabber. :)

redsolution/xabber-android,open,General launcher widget which represents state,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As a user I want to add a general launcher widget to my desktop which changes according to the state of Xabber. By default the launcher icon is monochrome gray scale when Xabber is not running. If I use the launcher, Xabber starts in the background and the launcher changes to a color icon. When Xabber has received a message or a request, a logo with a small 'i' badge is displayed. When Xabber is running and the launcher is used again, the application will run in the foreground.

![general-launcher-widget](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/198964/2099614/32eaec84-8f3e-11e3-86be-39e1871773a2.png)

Benefit of this launcher widget is that the state of Xabber (running in the background or not and having messages or requists or not) can be seen by the user directly.

See attached image which illustrates this idea. Note that this functionality is independent of a notification icon on the top of the screen. A user should configure the notification icon separately.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Xabber sends Invalid XML: unescaped ampersands from entity caps,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","One of my contacts uses the Cisco Jabber client. It sends caps like this:

``` xml
<c hash='sha-1'

     node='http://protocols.cisco.com/jabber?v=9.2.1&amp;p=mac'

Xabber then sends this as the body of the IQ to discover the entity info:

``` xml
<query xmlns=""http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info""
       node=""http://protocols.cisco.com/jabber?v=9.2.1&p=mac#LHf6s4litc8qpFDmhgJF+RIY1g0=""></query>
```

The problem is in the URI that represents the client. While having an ampersand in a URI is quite fine, note that it is unescaped in the `node` attribute of the disco request. This is invalid XML, and the server closes the connection. Xabber then reconnects repeatedly because the invalid XML keeps being sent as long as presence is received from this client.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,OTR leads to deadlock (no sending possible),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","When using OTR and the connection brakes for whatever reason (eg. connection issues or one side disabled it) it leads to a denial of service/deadlock situation (no message can be sent). Sometimes it says:""OTR encrypted session has been terminated. You should do that, too!"" or ""Messages has not been sent!"". To solve this situation both clients have to disconnect/restart the client or disable OTR that is highly confusing especially non-technical people.
It would be great if Xabber could simply reestablish OTR automatically in case of an error instead of denying/blocking the service so the communication channel stays up. 

I've experienced it multiple times that the chat partners couldn't answer since they didn't know what to do in such a situation and the connection was lost for the day. 

Xabber has such a nice OTR implementation but its nearly useless due to the bug above. I hope you can fix this.

redsolution/xabber-android,open,Add WhatsApp protocol support in Xabber,[],"Hello Александр!

Here it goes. Let me explain what I did to add the protocol:
- I modified UI to add the option at create account. There's a bug which adds an empty row in the protocol list (dunno why!)
- I modified the basic connection files to remove XMPPConnection class to Connection. This allows us to abstract the connection type (so we have WA and XMPP). I had to modify some files but the change is pretty straightforward
- I added the WA protocol class (which are a port of libpurple implementation)
- I created WAConnection which is the WA counterpart for XMPPConnection. It manages the socket by itself (the proxied connection is not properly handled, modifications needed here) using two threads instead the PacketWriter/Reader classes.
- Added the WAContacts class, which creates a SQLite table to store WA contacts (cause they don't get stored in the server!). Here I'd need you to review the DB stuff to add migration functions and all that stuff. Maybe we could just do phone contact integration and allow the user to import all the contacts present in the phone contact list.

As final notes. Everything is done by emulating XMPP protocol. When I want Xabber to update the UI I just create some XMPP Packet and send it to the packet listeners. It works great for chats, conferences, vcards...

If you need any extra clarification feel free to ask (you already have my email)

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,"what about a roadmap, particularly for key user features?",[],"There seems to be very little development activity going on since the move to open source xabber. In addition, judging from the version numbers, development happens in small steps only. Comments here are months old...

It leaves me wondering how much redsolution is still behind the project?

To be fair, starting an open source project, building a community, etc. are not easy tasks. Yet, I think a few steps could be made that show that RS is still actively behind the project. Announcing a roadmap for key user features - like file transfer and nice emoji support - that describes the features for a decent version 1.0 within half a year (and maybe some ideas for version 2.0) would go a long way giving trust to users to stay instead of looking for other xmpp alternatives, and help them convince their friends to switch, too. It would also signal to developers that it is worth to invest their time here rather than somewhere else.

Could Red Solution please reply and share their thoughts and ideally plans?

In my experience xabber heavily drains my phone battery. A bit of investigation suggests that a big culprit here is a very short keepalive timeout (30s) for xmpp connections. Another side effect of this is a big data consumption (about 2MB / day with 3 jabber accounts, not used at all).

Im currently testing increasing values of keepAliveInterval and keepAliveResponse in res/raw/smack_config.xml to 1800s. So far, my battery drain seems to be normal again.

Would you mind increasing those values or make them configurable?

Not sure if it's just a message sending issue or an actual network disconnection issue, however, my wife uses Xabber, and frequently (and pretty much any time she logs in our out), I get sent about 50 messages, all within one second basically repeating variations of:

15:45:21 xxx@yyy.zz has become Available
15:45:21 xxx@yyy.zz has become Offline

Often they alternate. Sometimes there's 50 ""is available"" messages in a row. Occasionally there's an ""Extended away"" message in there, too. I guarantee you, she's not manually logging off and on 50 times a second. :)

She's on a Samsung Galaxy Tab (first edition) with Gingerbread (2.3).

Sometimes this happens so often, it's hard to find the actual legitimate messages inside literally hundreds of these connection messages. If often seems to happen just before she gets disconnected, so I'm not sure if this is causing a disconnection, or just a reaction to it.

redsolution/xabber-android,closed,Ping interval setting and ping wakelock,[],"Hello!

Please add an option in the settings which lets the user decide when Xabber should ping (xmpp-ping) the server.

My mobile provider keeps idle connections for about 10 minutes, so I would like to save energy by setting the ping interval of the idling Xabber connection to about 9 minutes.
The hardcoded default is 1 minute, I think. //edit1: Actually 30 seconds.
An option in seconds instead of minutes would be even better, so I can use 9,5 minutes (570 second), which is even more efficient.

Thanks in advance! :)

//edit1:
Even worse, the default seems to be 30. It was just 60 for me because the phone was in deep-sleep, which sends the packet about 30 seconds later.

//edit2:
Just for fun I tested the deepsleep-delay from edit1:
Assuming a ping in Xabber should happen every 30 second after the last packet, the average delay for a xmpp-ping was about 30 to 35 seconds, with a maximum of 60 seconds, and a minimum of 0 when I had luck.
So the total time between two pings was 90 seconds in the worst case.

I also discovered, the opensource mail client k9Mail can send packets without delay even in deepsleep. 
Perhaps this helps to understand how: https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/blob/master/src/com/fsck/k9/service/SleepService.java
A reliable ping for Xabber would be much better than just setting it to 30secs and hoping the best.

//edit3:
But wait, there's more!
In some cases the delay increases to over 90, so the time between two pings is over 120. In that case the client will reconnect to the XMPP server. It doesn't even matter if the server answers the ping in time or not.
I always wondered why I keep getting login-messages in Pidgin about 4 times per hour from my Xabber-using contacts. Usually I blamed failures in the handover-process of the celltowers, but now I found the true answer: Xabber and it's inability to handle pings and timeouts. ;)
