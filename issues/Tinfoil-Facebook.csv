velazcod/Tinfoil-Facebook,open,CookieSyncManager has been deprecated since API 21,[],"Hi,

I noticed that CookieSyncManager is still in use to sync the cookies in BaseFacebookWebViewActivity.java. However, this class has been deprecated since API 21 and is not guaranteed to work for later API levels. (Reference: [Android API Guide](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieSyncManager.html))

After API 21, [CookieManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieManager.html) should work fine with itself and CookieManager.flush() is a replacement for CookieSyncManager.sync().

I also found some related discussions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30502411/cookiesyncmanager-is-now-deprecated-what-can-i-use-instead).

velazcod/Tinfoil-Facebook,closed,Issue #94: Proxies silently not working in Marshmallow,[],- Create and use setLollipopWebViewProxy
velazcod/Tinfoil-Facebook,closed,Proxies silently not working in Marshmallow,[],"On Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) / Cyanogen OS 13.0-ZNH0EAS2JK, setting a proxy in Tinfoil-Facebook has no net effect. I like to use Orbot, and first noticed that setting Tinfoil to use the Facebook.onion site never worked, so I set this back to auto. Later I noticed that FB was presenting accurate local weather when traveling -- further digging confirmed that my connection was not Torified.

I've finally had time to dig in during the holiday break, and seem to have made a fix. The problem is to do with a change to the ProxyChangeAction intent between 4.4 (KitKat) and 5.0 (Lollipop). The creation and setting of a ProxyProperties intent extra has become mandatory, and ProxyProperties has both been renamed (to ProxyInfo) and had its constructors replaced with static methods.

This issue may affect only a narrow range of specific Lollipop and Marshmallow versions."
velazcod/Tinfoil-Facebook,open,Feature Request: Active Friends in a new (invisible) Tab,[],"I've been using Tinfoil-Facebook for a while and it is a good alternative to all the official Facebook apps.
But I noticed there are things that can be improved without too much effort yet the improvement will be very effective.

1. The only problem about the third-party apps that they do not leave me at the same place where I left the 'news feed' after visiting the 'setting tab', 'messages tab' or something else.
So, we need a dedicated tab (invisible and inaccessible to the user) assigned to the 'news feed'.
It should not be allowed to be used to do something else.

2. I can't see who is online instantly like the way I could do with the official apps. So, another tab should be dedicated to this app to see the 'Active Friends'. Link: https://m.facebook.com/buddylist.php?

3. A quick logout button we need but the Facebook logout URL may not be trustworthy (https://m.facebook.com/logout.php?). It changes according to the user account. Once it was in my case: https://m.facebook.com/logout.php?h=AfciRcPxAkrOnfuv&t=1479427326
So, we should have an option to automatically save the logout URL into the cache. And a button should be placed somewhere so that we can quickly logout of the Facebook.

All these features will be the minor changes but we can rip off the benefits of the features if introduced in the next release."

I know you're frequently asked to tinfoil whatever apps. But wrapping Diaspora and Friendica would be a huge service to the community indeed.

Assuming that there is no way to enable the required permissions (without ""rooting"", etc), would there be a chance of getting a workaround?

For instance, whenever the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is not provided, could the long-press result in a pop-up that allows you to open the post in a browser? I could then save the image using the browser.

It's possible to maintain backward compatibility of tinfoil?
You could disable the new features with structures similar to ""if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT> = Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB)"" or something else?
Or does not make sense because the version 1.1.8 is already the best that you can get from sdk 10?
in this case, the questions don't make sense.

This app is for those people who require a Tinfoil Hat ([reference to english word ""tin foil hat"" here]) for Facebook. It creates a sandbox (an isolated environment without access to personal data, e.g. your address book), in which facebook\'s mobile site runs. [No more ""INTERNET permissions"" declaration here, because it is a bit obvious]

Coarse location permissions are only used if you activate \""Allow Check-ins\"" in the preferences.

If you are skeptical about it, feel free to check the source code listed above. [changed order of the last two sentences here]
""""""

The statements in ""[ ]"" brackets are comments that are not inside the actual translation, but which try explain my changes.

If you disagree with anything, please leave a comment below and I will modify it.

May I ask btw. how many active Play Store registered installs of Tinfoil with German locale there are? (You can see this somewhere in your Developer Console, I think.)

velazcod/Tinfoil-Facebook,open,friend tagging feature,[],"Okay, this is the PR that requires discussion.

I was annoyed that m.facebook.com doesn't support tagging friends in status updates and comments the same way you can on the desktop site (i.e. just by typing their name). I discovered that [it _is_ possible to do it on mobile](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/27576/how-to-tag-friends-via-mobile-web-site-m-facebook-com). So I wanted to add this functionality to Tinfoil.

The problem is that it requires cooperation with a Facebook app, so that it can have access to your friends list. The app I created is [this one](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/266257470187937) and it has literally no code in it -- it exists to create an API key, and then it redirects to a URL that doesn't exist, and Tinfoil intercepts that.

So, see what you think of the tagging function here! You have to go to the preferences to turn it on, and then while you're typing a status update or comment you click on the ""Tag Friend"" menu item. When you select one to tag, it inserts a cryptic code into the current text field, and that turns into a tag once you submit it.
