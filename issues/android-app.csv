### Duplicate?
Have you searched the issues of this repository if your issue is already known? yes

### Actual behaviour
When I find a bug (including this one, how meta) or something reportable (such as a content rendering issue), I need to go to the github page manually, and create a bug there.

### Expected behaviour
It would be good to have a direct link to the new issue template, ideally prepopulated with environment details and logs

# Steps to reproduce the issue
1. Find a bug, or rendering issue
2. Go to the side menu of the app in search of a “report issue”, or “report rendering issue” in article view
3. Can't find
4. Open the browser to  https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/issues/new manually, and be sad

# Your experience with wallabag Android app
It worked without problems with Wallabag v1, but this is quite a while ago. As I cannot even log into the server I cannot say more about the app at the moment.

# Special Setup here
I am rewriting the urls to let it look nice. I do not want to see the web directory here. Also I disabled the register page as I do not want to have people registering accounts on my instance here.
The following setup is used in the Apache webserver:

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^wallabag\.domain\.tld$ [NC]
RewriteRule !^web/ /web%{REQUEST_URI} [L,NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ app.php [QSA,L]
<FilesMatch "".*register$"">
Order Allow,Deny
Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

I am happy to provide further information about my setup, problem, whatsoever. Unfortunally the lack of a working Android client stops me using Wallabag at all. I need to get it working. :-)"

I have tried to add the auto-hide functionality to the action bar by using scrollView.setOnScrollChangeListener(). I tried to do it with the webViewContent, but due to its nesting within the scrollview, it was really buggy. 

The only issue I can see is that when the bar is showing/hiding, there is artificating at the bottom of  the screen.

The system status bar doesn't get hidden, but I believe that would be relatively simple to implement.

On a side note, when playing around with the fling gestures to switch articles, I found that they were pretty unreliable. Changing them to apply on the scrollView seemed to make them much more reliable but this isn't something I've tested or fully understand...I am an android development newbie."

wallabag/android-app,open,Improve readability of wide content,[],"# Issue details

### Duplicate?
Have you searched the issues of this repository if your issue is already known? yes

### Actual behaviour
Look at content that is wider than the screen, e.g.:
- a wide `<pre>`(?) like <https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167>
- tables from wikipedia like at <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worte_des_Vorsitzenden_Mao_Tsetung#Struktur_und_Inhalt>

Such content is not squeezed to fit into the screen width, instead one can scroll horizontally to see all of it.
However, the scrolling is difficult because swiping to much to the left goes to the next article.

### Expected behaviour
Either squeeze the content (which might look bad) or [offer to] disable going the the next article by swiping. Maybe there's some other solution, too.

Some long articles (example: <https://www.techstage.de/ratgeber/3D-Drucker-Welches-Filament-fuer-welchen-Einsatzzweck-4158362.html>) have pieces rendered incorrectly in the app, see the screenshot below: Somewhere far down, a black triangle (always that shape) is overlayed over the text, and text from somewhere else in the article too, which makes reading impossible.

I have also tested wallabag after removing those two tools but it is still not working.

wallabag/android-app,closed,Connection test doesn't use https even when specifying https,[],"Hi,

so this issue refernces addresses the famous ""wallabag service not found"" error. I just installed the android app and pointed it to my instance, but it failed to connect.

I'm using a fresh docker instance and apache to reverse proxy (I know, I know). Since I use acme.sh to get Let's Encrypt certificates, all calls to http://*.mydomain.tld point to the same static html. That means ""http**s**://wallabag.mydomain.tld"" points to the real Wallabag instance and ""http://wallabag.mydomain.tld"" points to a static html file which of course can't be parsed by the app.

In the Android app, even when I specifically set the wallabag-URL to http**s**://wallabag.mydomain.tld, it requests the non-https version from my server and can't connect. I solved this for be by adding a static redirect for http://wallabag.mydomain.tld to http**s**://wallabag.mydomain.tld, which breaks acme.sh compatibility but works for the android app. I know that I can just disable this redirect again after setting the app once, but it took me quite a while to figure this out and I think this is undesired behaviour.

So I think this issue needs to be addressed so that the Android app really uses http**s** when asked to.

Solution: in my case, it was due to the setting `http2_max_field_size` set to a too low value by default in nginx's configuration.
Using `http2_max_field_size 16k; http2_max_header_size 32k;` in my configuration solved the issue.**



I am not absolutely sure that it is a wallabag error _per se_, as a similar issue was reported some time ago on okhttp's repository (https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/1897) and it was an incompatibility of some kind between okhttp and nginx 1.9.5.

All the `.png`s were generated using the provided `.svg`.

Also, as mentioned at #595, the icons need go into the `mipmap` directory only if we are building different apks for different display density (which I think we aren't).

Also, the discussion at #595 mentioned the welcome icons but I don't think they need changing because they represent the service while these icons represent one specific product based off that service. Also, they look better in that context. That's just my understanding of it and I will make a PR for them as well if someone feels that is required.

Someone will need to credit Michael Cook for the icon in the About screen so that the requisite credits are present when this icon goes live. This is how he said he would like to be credited:

wallabag/android-app,closed,Voice read doesn't work without Internet connection,[],"I'm a recent user of your app, and so far I'm loving it. I think I especially love the voice sintesyzer: I can hear my saved articles while I'm working out at the park or doing the weekly shopping or any of those routinary tasks that don't require much concentration but don't allow us to be reading our mobile's screen for many minutes. Now I can do more than just listening music (which is great, of course, but sometimes I like to know from my favoriute columnists or heard that blog post I hadn't the time to read the other day). Is fantastic.

But the downside is that it requires an Internet connection, and consumes a nice amount of data: about 10 min. took almost 5 MB from my data plan (I normally use the voice sintezyser at 170% speed; don't know if higher speed makes more data to be up/downloaded per minute).
Well, AFAIK both the sintesyzer software and the voice files are installed in our android devices by default, so, why the Internet connection? Couldn't all the process be done locally, on the device, keeping our data plans intact and also keeping what we hear private?
There's also the privacy issue I've mentioned: If I'm sending to Google's servers the articles I'm hearing, Google is associating what I listen with my device ID, IP address, SIM card serial number, location, and all those permissions that Android doesn't report but if we use some app like Xprivacy we ""discover"". Well, if an Internet connection is indispensable because the process can't be done only on the device, could you switch Google's servers for some other that are fairly good in regards to service's quality, but it's also privacy friendly, and, if possible, FLOSS?

wallabag/android-app,open,Choose icon shortcuts in article view [Suggestion],"[Label(name=""Feature""), Label(name=""UI"")]","Hello,
First, thank you all for the great app on Android!

I wanted to suggest a new option, in wallabag's app parameters, allowing to choose what shortcuts you want to display when reading an article. 

By default, the ""Mark as read"" and ""Mark as favorite"" icons are shown (plus ""Share"" in landscape mode). However, I think that the shortcuts one might want here really depends on the usage you have of wallabag. For example, one might want to mark articles as read and tag the articles for further reference, when another one will delete every article after reading them.

Thus, I would really enjoy the possibility to have an option allowing me to choose which two shortcuts I want to see among the elements in the menu.

I am really hoping to see that in coming releases and I would be happy to develop the idea a bit more if necessary or if I am unclear.

If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml files.  If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.  If you are deliberately setting android: attributes in style definitions, make sure you place this in a values-vNN folder in order to avoid running into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

Is there a way to get a version distributed on f-droid and/or the app store? In f-droid at least, there is a way to mark a version as ""beta"" so that people don't upgrade by default.

Now, i know I could install the packages straight from the release pages on GitHub, but the signature seemed different the last time I checked. This may be because F-Droid rebuilds the APKs and resigns them with its own signatures... I am not sure how to fixed this, so I asked the F-Droid people to clarify that part:

Now one should make 3 actions to call a search:
1. Press menu button
2. Tap Search menu item
3. Enter text pattern

What I propose is a Search button in the upper left. When tapped it turns out into search box, which receive text input.
The example can be found in the mail app Mailbird, for example. This is how its search button looks like in idle mode

If I delete the article and add it again usually works, so there is no problem with the article.

I propose to implement 3 solutions:
1) When you update the article list try to re-download missing images (I mean partial, I don't know if full update tries to redownload all images but I think this is to much overhead)
2) If you enter in one article and images are not stored locally, try to show the online version, and then save them locally.
3) Add a button to refetch the article (download both, text and images).

wallabag/android-app,open,User-accessible logs,"[Label(name=""Improvement"")]","We often need to request logs from users. Sometimes it is a real PITA.

We need a way to easily gather and copy logs from within the app.

Standard `android.util.Log` doesn't provide any way to redirect or collect logs. It is possible to call `logcat` and gather the results, but it is ugly and has some limitations.

I was thinking about moving to [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) + [logback-android](https://tony19.github.io/logback-android/). It should allow to log to various outputs (standard Android logcat, file, etc.). Also, SLF4J's API is better (no need for explicit `String.format()` in logging). Though, it would require to replace all the `android.util.Log` usages.
I don't see any downsides of it.

Any other ideas?"

wallabag/android-app,closed,Don't retry to delete article if 404 received -> high battery drain,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","I am seeing an odd behaviour due (probably) to deleting an article both in the Android app, and the Web interface before it synced.

Now, the Android app repeatedly tries to delete the article, as seen in my webserver logs:

    wallabag.example.net 192.0.2.1 - - [19/Dec/2016:06:25:56 +0100] ""GET /delete/3992 HTTP/1.1"" 200 818 ""-"" ""okhttp/3.4.1""
    wallabag.example.net 192.0.2.1 - - [19/Dec/2016:06:26:01 +0100] ""GET /delete/3992 HTTP/1.1"" 200 818 ""-"" ""okhttp/3.4.1""
    wallabag.example.net 192.0.2.1 - - [19/Dec/2016:06:26:07 +0100] ""GET /delete/3992 HTTP/1.1"" 200 818 ""-"" ""okhttp/3.4.1""

Oddly enough, the application sees this as 404 error, as per the logcat (to follow), and keeps popping an unknown error (also to follow) before retrying to sync immediately. This leads to a high battery drain.

There are several things that could be done to address the issue.
* HTTP DELETE should be idempotent, and not return a 404, or any indication that the object to delete was not there, to the client. This is a GET happening here, but it should probably follow the same semantics
* In the current situation, if the Android app receives a 200 from a `GET /delete/...` wrapping a 404, this means that Wallabag has responded properly, but the item is no longer there, there should therefore be no need to retry the delete.
* Add some sort of incremental back-off in case of repeated sync failures to avoid draining the battery.
* Add a way to clear the app's sync queue, so one can manually cancel local sync actions that might be causing this sort of issue."

Here's a proof of concept. The android app that performs ""Favorite/Unfavorite"" via API (I've done basic implementation for the most of the v2 API methods in the library, but not yet integrated it in the app).

Changes:
 - Moved to v2 API. Dropped v1.9 support.
 - Rewritten update mechanism: faster (supposedly), more consistent (no updates for separate feeds that screw things up) updates.
 - Update on startup (#360).
 - Basic tags support (list by tag, add/modify/delete tags on articles) (#116).
 - Changed main activity UI (in order to have better navigation between tags and other lists).
 - Notifications updated a bit (progress added, etc.).
 - Other minor changes.

New opportunities (**not yet implemented** features that are now possible):
 - Show tags in lists and in article view.
 - Change article title (only UI is not implemented) (#288).
 - New data is available in DB: estimated reading time, language, preview picture URL, article creation date.

wallabag/android-app,closed,Use a service like transifex for translations,"[Label(name=""Improvement""), Label(name=""Translations"")]","It's not like it is our main problem, but usage of such services significantly facilitates project translation (from translators' point of view).

*Personally, I don't endorse SaaS, but in this case I find the compromise acceptable (a translation service can't tie us to itself - we can always switch to a different one or reject it).*

I checked out a few open source apps, here's the list by service:

**Transifex**:
Amaze File Manager
Autostarts
Clementine
Clementine Remote
Conversations
DAVdroid
K-9 Mail
OpenKeychain
OSMTracker
ownCloud

**Crowdin**:
DiasporaForAndroid
OpenVPN for Android
Xabber


**POEditor**:
Loop Habit Tracker


**Weblate**:
F-Droid
Red Moon


I had no projects translated with such a service, so I have no opinion from a maintainer's point of view.
I have little experience as a translator on such platforms. For some reason I didn't like POEditor. Transifex and Crowdin seem fine, **but (if I'm not mistaken) Transifex requires a translator to join a project (requires maintainer's confirmation) before he can do anything (like see a list of lines or suggest a translation)**. Maybe it is configurable, but it works like that [even here](https://www.transifex.com/wallabag/wallabag/).
Crowdin allows anyone with an account to suggest translations. Crowdin is my personal preference so far."

# 2 Why is the url added to the offline queue?

I am online and it is still added to the offline queue. Why? From a programmers point of view i understand, but can we immediately please sync local queue items to the wallabag instance if we detect i am online?
# 3 I did not receive feedback on first adding of the url

So even when i added the article at first, i also got no feedback. A toast is needed here, too: ""your url has been added to wallabag""

Expected result: no errors, article is changed offline until ""full sync"" is done (probably).

Actual result:

Cause: server (v2) responds with HTTP status code `404` for any action with removed articles. (I did not test it against v1 server).

This is pretty serious, because there are no way for user to get rid of it except to clear the app data (at least I'm not aware of any other way).
"
wallabag/android-app,closed,Fix UI freezes,"[Label(name=""Ready for review"")]","I rewrote something I wanted to rewrite almost from the beginning of #282.

Action processing before this PR (does not apply to ""sync queue"" and ""update feeds"" actions):
1. _(DB transaction is started here)._
2. The offline queue is checked.
3. If the action wasn't canceled out by queue contents, an attempt to transmit the action to server is performed.
4. If the transmission fails, the action is added to the offline queue.
5. _(DB transaction is ended here)._
6. ...
7. The queue is synced sometime later.

After this PR:
1. _(This is done inside of one short DB transaction)_ The offline queue is checked. If the action is not canceled out, it is added to the queue.
2. If the queue is not empty, ""sync offline queue"" action is triggered.
3. The queue is synced _(using only one short DB transaction to write changes at the end)_.

Essentially, the queue sync is the only way to pass local changes to the server. That change allowed to remove a lot of code duplication. And it also allowed to remove most of the DB transactions that presumably caused UI freezes. 
Though, the is a limitation: the is no (easy?) way to get the action result for a specific action. But it was barely used anyway.

- Add an IntentService and some basic logic to perform network-related operations in BG service and to enqueue failed actions for later sync.

I create this PR so we can discuss something about it in the future.
Currently I have some thing to implement, so code-related collaboration is not yet needed (not that I expect much).

TODO:
- [x] Use background service for the most operations.
- [x] Handle offline operations.
- [x] Basic auto-sync.
- [x] Decent notifications.
- [x] Basic PreferenceFragment-based settings.
- [x] Set `configurationIsOk` flag somewhere (requires configuration master/wizard?).
- [x] Unset `configurationIsOk` flag in Settings.
- [x] Delete obsolete translation lines.

Not so urgent/important TODO:
- [Better temporary errors detection](#issuecomment-230098478).
- Better/prettier/fancier notifications.
- Do something with UI responsiveness (while background operation is performed).
- Refactoring: reuse code.

- Show last update time somewhere.

I use it on my tablet at home without issue (steady wifi and FFTH at home).
However, in the bus on my way to work, the connection is very bad and there are a lot of timeouts (different from a 'no service' like in the metro, which causes no bug).
If I access wallabag during one of those timeouts, it will cause issue to happen. And later, I can't save an article using my phone, because ""ID or password are incorrect"". Which it is not of course, because I did not change them.
Proofs that they are not incorrect:
- I can still access wallabag from my tablet and computer with the same old ID/password
- I can still access wallabag on my phone and it updates correctly. Ex: I add an article using my computer, refresh my wallabag on the phone -> it works! so it manages to read the data on the server.
- If I delete the wallabag app from my phone, reinstall it, use the same ID/password and token... I can add articles using my phone. Until the next timeout (and then it's the same all over again).

wallabag/android-app,closed,Fixes #221 Deleting an articles throws a 404 error,[],"This commit fixes #221 and some more issue w.r.t. toggle actions on an
article. In wallabag v2 if we request a toggle action, e.g. /star/123,
and if we are not logged in anymore, we get redirected to that action
after successful login. But our app then did re-toggle that action.
Therefore the action had been called twice. When deleting an article
this resulted in a 404. When starring or archiving, this toggled the
action twice --> resulting in no action.

So now if we recognize that we executing an action results in a login
page, we request a new login page, do a clean login and afterwards
recall the action request. This way we avoid getting redirected to the
action request.

A couple of bonuses would be :
- Being able to choose between ""only synchronize most recent posts"" (my favorite) and ""only synchronize oldest posts"" (and maybe, in addition, ""always synchronize favorites"" ? )
- Being able to force-purge oldest posts stored locally, to fore-synchronize most-recent ones (to always have the most-recent posts in the application, even if it means purging older ones, to respect the limit)

A bit later I added another link off-line. Now I have three links to upload, but since the first one fails, I am stuck. Worse, it looks like all further links I will store off-line will be lost, because I cannot upload them.

Conclusions:
1. If an upload fails, the remaining off-line links should be uploaded nevertheless.
2. It would be nice to know _why_ a link upload failed.
3. It would be nice to be able to remove the offending link, to restore normal operation.

wallabag/android-app,closed,Display the base URL for syncing on the config page,[],"_From @khinsen on November 13, 2015 11:15_

Mobile apps that want to sync with Wallabag need a URL pointing to a Wallabag instance. It is not always obvious to a user what this URL must be. As I [found out](https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/issues/118) trying to configure the Android app, Wallabag instances on Framabag require `/u/username` as part of the URL, whereas I had expected this postfix to be appended by the Android app (after all, it asks me for my username).

The most reliable source for the base URL is the server, so I suggest displaying it on the config page, right next to the feed token.

By changing the parameter to ""TLSv1.2"" (See https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html#getInstance%28java.lang.String%29), well, TLS 1.2 should be working, but I can not estimate what would get broken by that, as a higher API-Level might be required.

I hope that TLS 1.2 gets supported soon, if it is possible.

- Initial font size and font family are applied **after** the article is loaded (I'm not into HTML+CSS, so I don't know if there is a robust way to set it before loading (**and** don't break the ability to change these parameters after loading)).
- I have no idea how to adjust font parameters correctly, so I just change style on ""body"" element. I presume somebody else can fix that.
"
wallabag/android-app,closed,Updates,[],"- Better themes support (all activities; theme selection from list; better colors).
- Serif typeface for article fonts as an option (was: inconsistent, depending on main/nightmode.css).
- Font size for articles fonts option.

I'm not into CSS, so improvements are very welcome.
Font setting implementation is plain stupid, but, well, you are free to replace it anytime.

Update: icons color for dark themes **was not** fixed in this update.

I'm pretty sure HTTP Auth won't break anything, but I'm also **not** sure it currently works (feeds + network commands will probably work; web-content (images from server) may not work (the code to support it is added, but not debugged)).

- A little update for prev/next buttons: thee buttons now honor context (e.g. if article was opened in ""favorites"" list, the buttons will move though articles in ""favorites"" list (well, I hope they would)).
- Minor changes.

Full/fast sync explanation:
Well, there is no actual _synchronization_, only one-way _update_.
""Update all feeds"" option in menu starts full update (wipes DB, successively updates ""Unread"", ""Archived"" and ""Favorites"" feeds). There are no more other update options in menu.
In each list (in the mentioned swipe views) pull-to-refresh starts update for the corresponding feed.
For ""Favorite"" and ""Archived"" feeds it's pretty easy: read all feed and update local entries.
For ""Unread"" feed update has a little hack: it reads feed and adds new entries, but stops as soon as it encounters an article with the same articleId it has locally. It allows quickly load recently added articles (though, it won't load some old moved-from-archive article). This is previously so called ""Fast sync"". This also is the default behavior for pull-to-refresh for ""Unread"" feed. I probably should make it optional.

"
wallabag/android-app,closed,Major update,[],"So.. the initial goal of this was to make selecting articles as read sync back to the server.

Then things got kind of hairy. Wallabag's article id fro the server was not present in the local DB. DB interactions is all handcrafted.

To make things easier to work with and since there has been no big updates in a while, I decided to make some changes. These changes are breaking, but that should be no big deal since everything lives on the server anyway, just resync.

To make DB things less manual, greenDAO is used to handle all that, which makes things less easy to break by mistake. The FeedUpdater have been extended to store article ids, not just the internal id.

To make it possible to actually sync selecting articles as read, username and password is now settings to. Since that is done by first signing in and then issue a request to `/?action=toggle_archive&id=<article_id>`. To make this less painful OkHttp is now used instead of the regular HTTP client. As a result of now having login info, adding articles is now automated also, instead of the browser bounce.

Also, to separate code, the share action is now broken out to BagItProxyActivity.

I might have missed some things here, but most of the transitioning things are made in https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/commit/3dd80c032cd7eae74eac149c8208d89b9774219d.

This is a changeset against the master branch. While writing this I also just realized that there was a dev branch with a few changes. Those would probably be pretty easy merged in to this as well.

I'll look at the first remark tomorrow, but it shouldn't be a big deal to decrease the font size.

I use wallabag only in the Paris subway, with almost no internet connectivity, everything work well but images don't.

Images are not cached while synchronizing, so I can't view them offline, and sometime, it hurts the readability of an article to miss pictures. So an option synchronize them too may be cool for me.
