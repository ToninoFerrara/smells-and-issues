The step  (time / 1000) or (motionTime / 1000) will divide (long)/(int) producing long therefore long. 
if time or motionTime is smaller than 1000 e.g. 6  the division should be 0.006 but since it is long the output will be 0.

flyingrub/SpeedMeter,closed,"Tweak ""use miles per hour"" setting",[],"F-Droid version 2.3.1.  The option ""Use miles per hour"" in settings really should be ""Use Imperial measurements"" instead.  Those of us in the US who continue to cling to our outdated imperial measurements for distances and speeds would also like to see the distance traveled, max speed, and average speed reported in imperial measurements as well.  Therefore the option ""use miles per hour"" in settings really should toggle all the distances/speeds to display in imperial measurements.  So this is really an ""enhancement"" request.  Thanks."

1 meter per second = 2.23693629 miles per hour so that would be the number to use in the code rather than 3.6.  It could be an option.

flyingrub/SpeedMeter,closed,Don't count stops towards time/average speed,[],"When you're stopped (e.g. at a red light), the stop time should not count towards the average speed. This is usually how bike computers work. The time spent at red lights would otherwise unnecessarily decrease the average speed.

There should be two timers, 'time' and 'movement time'. 'Time' is always counting up, while 'Movement time' is only counting as long as speed > 0. 'Movement time' is then used to calculate the average speed. (It would probably be interesting to show both times on the screen tho)

This mode could be made optional and added to the (still empty) settings screen :)
