Streaming hasn't been implemented yet, but as mentioned in #20 there are some workarounds using additional apps to stream music played by Clementine on the desktop to the phone. As mentioned, this workarounds only works for streaming to the phone itself. I'd like to go a step forward and stream to my Chromecast. Nowadays, having the option to stream to either the TV or speakers (with either version of a Chromecast device) is extremely useful.

There are many Android apps that stream from the phone itself to the Chromecast, what I'm suggesting is using this app as the remote/bridge between my computer (where all my music resides) and the Chromecast, so there's no need to download music from my desktop to my phone to stream it to the Chromecast.
The only app that has this functionality is Plex (server and Android apps), but given that its focus is movies and tv, the music side is lacking a lot.

clementine-player/Android-Remote,closed,Add the possibility to order the albums by release date in the library,[],"Hello guys,

I really like clementine and the android remote client, but it always bothered me that albums are displayed in alphabetical order instead of chronological order. I'd be happy if you would merge this commit asap, so it's in the next release of the app. :)

You might want to check, if this line is okay, cause I could not figure out what IDX_COUNT is used for and I am using the same index.

Best Regards,

<b>Commit-Message:</b>
""Fixes #114.

This commit allows the user to select between ""alphabet"" and ""release"" in the preferences for the default ordering for albums in the LibraryFragment.
The default setting is ""alphabet"".

If the albums are sorted by release, the release year is added as prefix in front of the album title, like: ""2015 - Album title"".
In case of alphabetical ordering just the album title is displayed.

If an artist is added to Clementine's playlist, this setting is respected (therefore the titles are added by release year or alphabet).""

- Deleting multiple songs from a playlist takes an awful long time, because the user has to ""long touch"" every song and delete it. So a multi-selection mode (similar to the one in the standard Android gallery app) would be nice. It could be activated from a menu in the top right corner.
- Simple ""swipe-to-delete-a-song-from-the-playlist"" mode (maybe with an undo functionality)
- Also easy re-arrangement of songs in the playlist would be nice (multi-selection as a bonus)
- layout improvements: smaller track number, overall less padding
- option to activate smart playlist modes (e.g. 50 random tracks, dynamic random mix, etc.)
- load/save a playlist from your Android device
- synchronize playlists with Clementine desktop application

2. Press the magnifying glass, and search for any string that matches some of the songs on the playlist, but not the first song.
3. Press one of the search results.

Instead of playing the selected song, Clementine plays the song whose index in the full playlist (without searching) is the same as this song's index in the search results. For example, if you press the first search result, Clementine will always play the first song in the playlist, NOT the first actual result for this search.

It's mostly working, but there are some bugs, though, dealing with the option to create folders on the SD card for artists and albums.

If the artist or album title has certain punctuation marks, the download fails with the error ""No storage device found!"", which is pretty unhelpful.  Punctuation in the song titles is no problem, so it's just due to the way the folders are getting created.  Some accented foreign characters cause failure, too, but they simply get skipped, with no error message and no halting of the operation.  The punctuation I've come across so far that gives problems are double quotes (""), question marks, and colons.  Periods work fine, as do hyphens, parenthesis, and exclamation points.

If the artist name has a slash (AC/DC, for example), the folder hierarchy gets screwy. Slashes in song names cause no issue, they seem to be converted to dashes.  If the artist or album name starts with a period, the folder gets created as a hidden directory.

I don't know; at least 1,086 according to $(ls ~/Music | wc -l).  But the remote app only displays the library by artist, resulting in a list that's so big it's useless.  And each item takes up so much screen space with the padding and ""1 albums"" underneath that I can only see 8 artists in the list at a time.  That would mean I'd have to scroll through 136 pages to see them all.

The library view needs grouping by genre, artist, album, year, etc. to be useful.  It also needs to be much more compact.  I don't need a separate line telling me how many albums by that artist exist in my library.

Hello !

First of all, many thanks for both Clementine player and its remote control. Best pieces of software ever since the late Amarok!!

You added volume control to the remote which is great but there's no option to change by how much the volume will go higher or lower. It's set to 10 but it'd be great to be able to modify this with multiple choices or manually.

I've got some issues regarding the library view on the remote app. It seems like Clementine keeps track of old files that once was in the library, but are now removed. So if I once put in a .flac file, then switched it out with an .mp3 file, both the .flac and the .mp3 are listed in the remote app library (but on the PC it's only the correct one listed). Please take a look at the attached image to see what happens when i try to play those tracks.

I was not able to fix this issue with a full library rescan on either the desktop version or the remote app. I thought that surely uninstalling and reinstalling both programs would fix this, however the duplicates still remain. What i had to do to fix this was to remove the C:\Users\XXXXX.config\Clementine folder, forcing it to create a whole new library.

Whether this issue is something the Remote app should fix, or if the problem lies with the desktop program, i think it's a pretty serious issue for anyone who's switched out songs in their library at least once.

When I built the app locally myself and tested in an emulator, it worked, so I'm not sure what is happening here. Any idea how to fix this?

This app uses customized versions of protobuf-java & jmdns in libs/jmdns.jar and libs/pb.jar.

In order to properly package it for F-Droid, the sources need to be available. Maybe they can be included as git submodules?

It would be nice if there was an easier/faster way to completely shut-down the application.

At the moment ""android back"" button kind of just minimizes the application. Normally ""home"" button does that and back closes the application. So the flow of this remote app goes a bit against the normal android UX. 

If not through the back button, this could be solved using an extra button (possibly at the top of the application) which would disconnect AND shut down the application. At this moment, user first needs to disconnect and then close it which is a few unnecessary steps too mane in my opinion.

This would also reduce the battery consumption as well I guess since it is not necessary to have the remote turned on all the time (this is a remote application, not a player application and there is no need to keep it on as much as a player would be).

Currently I need to enter the IP of the remote Clementine machine into the Android app. This is cumbersome and inconvenient. For example, my IP might change regularly and be different in different networks.

It would be great if Clementine Remote Android would support some more automatic form of peering, for example using:
- ZeroConf:
  Display a list of Clementine services in the network
- Bluetooth:
  1) Peer your phone with the desktop using bluetooth
  2a) Then announce some extra bluetooth service (I do not know if bluetooth allows custom services)
  2b) If that is impossible: Show the list of connected bluetooth devices and exchange connection information via file-transfer
- IPv6 multicast
  Basically a special purpose ZeroConf rip-off
- Local network broadcast
  Similar to what NetBIOS did

The app currently has a 1.35MiB download and a size of about 4MiB after installation. This is a lot on my phone which only has about 50MiB free on the internal storage after installing Android.

It would be nice if you could reduce the size of the application. I would expect an application that ""just"" connects to a service and displays a few buttons, but otherwise gets all data from that service, to be not larger than 1MiB.

Further it would be great if you could use the sdcard for storage. (I assume you cache the album covers, etc?) This might also help you in reducing the app size.

I am so happy using Clementine and being able to control it from my Android phone!  The new ability to download tracks and playlists to my phone is incredible!

The only thing that could make it better would be to be able to stream the current song in Clementine to my phone, playing it through my phone.  This way I could, for example, play music through my wifi network to a stereo system in a different room, far from my computer where Clementine is.  Since I can't fit that much music on my phone, this would be really handy.

There's a request on the Clementine issue tracker to stream to Icecast servers, but since this app can already download songs from Clementine, all it really needs to do is download the current track and play it on the phone, then delete it.  Maybe it could even cache it in RAM instead of writing it to /sdcard.

Thanks for this app and making Clementine even better!

2. Launch Clementine Remote App
3. Press 'Next track' What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The album art and track name should change, and the 'seek-segment' should jump to the beginning of the track.
I see that the album art and track name remains the same, but the 'seek-segment' behaves as expected as do the track length and the information in the notification tray. The only way to show the current artwork is to close and re-open the app each time the track changes. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

This happens regardless of firewall status. Please provide any additional information below. Just to say thanks for making such a fantastic app, I can't wait to see how it develops. I hope my issue can be fixed. As the versions didn't make a difference I wonder if the problem is somewhere in my clementine settings or linux mint.

Add lyrics (or possibly the entire song info page) to the remote.
When I use the remote app I'm not in front of my computer. And in front of the computer is the only location to comfortably read lyrics.
A little farther away from the screen (or on a tv for example) reading is uncomfortable.

clementine-player/Android-Remote,closed,Non latin playlists title not shown.,"[Label(name=""Priority-Medium""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""imported"")]","_From [e.vakhro...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/113174899026568325246/) on February 14, 2013 08:01:56_

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Rename playlist title to ""–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è"" (""Playlist"" in russian)
2. Connect to clementine with android.
3. Look on playlist name. You will see ""?????? ???????????????"" instead ""–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è"". What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected playlist title should display correct title (""–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è"" for example). What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? clementine-remote-android  0.3
