telecapoland/jamendo-android,open,Failing to remove callback when user disconnects from WiFi,[],"**What steps will reproduce the problem?**
In the setting, enable wifi only mode. Create a playlist with several musics. Start the playlist. When the first song is playing, disable WiFi. 

**What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**
Jamendo keeps running in the background (It does not play any song, but keeps running in background) and does not remove the callback that is responsible to track the music play progress. 

**Please provide any additional information below**
In the ""PlayerEngineImpl.java"" class, ""mHandler"" is responsible to run ""mUpdateTimeTask"" periodically (every one second). It seems that mHandler will be remove when the player is not playing. However, it seems that disconnecting from internet does not impact the playing status of the playlist. To ensure the callback is still executed in background, I added a log file in the method ""run()"" of ""mUpdateTimeTask"". After reproducing the issue, I can see that the log appears in the logcat every second. "
telecapoland/jamendo-android,closed,"Service seems running in the background, even when I stop the app",[],"**What steps will reproduce the problem?**
Open the app. Go to Radio menu. Select a channel and start playing. Then switch to another application (Jamendo is going to background and keeps playing). After a while, remove Jamendo from the recent app (stop the app).

**What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**
I expect by removing the app from recent list, it stops. Although Jamendo stops playing the sound, I can still see Jamendo Player item on my notification bar. 

**Please provide any additional information below**
I checked the number of wakelocks before and after reproducing the issue. It seems that this issue causes the system to acquire a wakelock, which drastically drained the battery of my device. "
telecapoland/jamendo-android,open,The internet accessed failed when loading the license picture?,[],"when I choose one ablum in the HomeActivity, It will start the PlayerActivity to play the ablum, but when the UI widget of mLicenseImageView uses internet to load the license picture the result is failed. I use a browser to visit ""http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/3.0/88x31.png"",the browser will show ""https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc-nd/3.0/88x31.png"" and the picture.

I want to know how to visit the URL of the license picture in the app . waitting for answer...

telecapoland/jamendo-android,closed,Wake lock permission,[],"Dear developers,

I am a researcher from Hong Kong. I am developing a static analysis tool for Android applications.

Recently, I applied my tool to analyze Jamendo and found that Jamendo does not use wake locks or wifi locks, but it acquires wake lock permission.

<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.WAKE_LOCK""></uses-permission>

Is this really necessary? Looking forward to your reply and hope we can help improve your project.

read your programe,I have a quesion:
public abstract class JSONBuilder<T> {

```
protected String root;

public JSONBuilder(){

telecapoland/jamendo-android,closed,Explicit invalid intent makes application access privileged resources,[],"Explicit intent that violates intent filter for activity IntentDistributorActivity makes the application access the network in Caller class while attempting to get a Jamendo remote file from Jamendo host.
Intent should be rejected before potentially causing security issues.

Explicit intent example
Action: PICK_ACTIVITY category: DEFAULT
URI: http://www.jamendo.com/fr/track/147517
Component: IntentDistributorActivity 
while intent filter defined in the Manifest specifies VIEW/DEFAULT as possible actions for activity IntentDistributorActivity
This intent makes the application attempt to connect with a remote host through execute method in class Caller. Part of the intent URI is also used in the call, making data coming from outside the application reach privileged method calls.

telecapoland/jamendo-android,closed,Equalizer on ICS/JB,[],"I think I have a solution for the Equalizer problem ([issue #24](https://github.com/telecapoland/jamendo-android/issues/24)).

The root cause was the fact that most probably on ICS+ versions Equalizer is bound to the lifetime of a MediaPlayer. As a result every time after MediaPlayer is released Equalizer needs to be released as well.

This caused some architectural changes - a global equalizer object can no longer be used (since it was valid only as long as the same song was playing). 

There were two special cases to be handled (when the global equalizer is unavailable):
- the song is stopped (no MediaPlayer object) and we want to manipulate the equalizer
- we open the equalizer during one song, it finishes and the next one is played - then we manipulate the equalizer
  Those cases needed to be covered by some kind of settings serialization and passing to the next Equalizer. Luckily, the Equalizer.Settings class have all what was needed for that purpose.

The global Equalizer object is used only when available (this is checked by the JamendoApplication.isEqualizerRunning method) to apply the settings in runtime. All other situations (no media playback) are covered using the Settings object instance passed to the newly created equalizer.

As a side effect I have implemented an Equalizer settings persistence mechanism to store settings between app launches.

Additionally I have found a typo in layout-mdpi/player.xml - pressing the Equalizer button was triggering 'Add to playlist' action.

I have added an additional permission (android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS) to the manifest. This was necessary to occasionally create a global Equalizer object to obtain some common settings (presets, number of bands and their level range) when the JamendoApplication.mEqualizer was not available.

I have verified this solution on Nexus S (JB), Sony Xperia P (ICS) and Samsung Galaxy Gio (GB). Seems to be working correctly.

The last line is obviously incorrect and caused a NumberFormatException followed by a crash of the application.

telecapoland/jamendo-android,closed,[Equalizer] AudioEffect crashing on ICS and JB,[],"I experience major problems using Jamendo Android app on ICS and JB.

The crash happens in this line (PlayerEngineImpl.java:223):

```
newEqualizer.setProperties(equalizer.getProperties());
```

According to what's pointed out on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11193239/using-audiosessionid-value-to-instantiate-audiofx-class) and on [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=33669) it's caused by a bug in ICS and (probably) JB.

Do you have any ideas how to fix this crash? 
So far I just commented out lines 218-228 in PlayerEngineImpl.java which simply disables the Equalizer. It may be used as a temporary workaround for ICS and JB, but dropping equalizer is surely not the final solution.

I have verified that this issue is reproducible on my Nexus S (with official ICS and Cyanogenmod 9 and 10) and Sony Xperia P.

The issue I have is this: whatever the streaming type (on 3G or wifi), sometimes, the streaming throws out a MEDIA_ERROR_UNKNOWN, which triggers an onTrackStreamError, and shows the toast string.stream_error, or sometimes an impossible to charge album info or something. I sometimes understand that the connection can be sketchy, especially when end of months throttled by the operator or whatnot. But that would be nice to have fallback plan to prevent playback from completely stopping. Sometimes when this happens, pushing the ""stop"" onscreen button and then play permits the track to finally play. Or have the fallback to begin downloading/caching the track so the streaming can happen from this cached track or whatnot. I'm no programmer so would be difficult to help you without creating a bunch more problems I would guess ;-)
