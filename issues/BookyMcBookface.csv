I really like your app, it works quite well, and I love the fact that it's the only epub reader without internet permission I have found in F-droid.

Anyway, I downloaded an epub I can't open. The book is located here: https://framaclic.org/h/traces-epub
The error message says: ""Something went wrong. Please report this book as a bug. (no sections)"". I attach an screenshot:

quaap/BookyMcBookface,open,suggestion to add text to speech and finish reading within in a certain time,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","#### Components

Booky Mybook Caffe is an Andoid application that works to read books on Android. The application is supported by various features that will make it easier for users to use it, especially by students who use this application to read textbooks.In addition, this application can also be used to read books stored in the user's folder and also books obtained online. This application can also be used online or offline.

here are some features that this application has:

- add books from folder 
- search your books 
- find books online
- show by
- sort by
- starts option 
- next and previous option
- brightness, and anymore

overall, the application is good enough but with some improvements I think the quality of this application will also increase.

#### Proposal Description

below are some ideas that might be included in this application so that this application is more convenient and interesting to use.
***finish reading within a certain time***

this is a feature that functions to calculate how many paragraphs or pages must be read every day so that the book can be read in a certain period. If this feature is implemented this feature will run in the following way:the user must first set the date of the book to read. from the date divided by the number of pages it will be found how many users have to read every day. This feature can be added by adding a new button on the book page
 
number of pages: number of days = number to read.
90: 6 = 15

from the result, the user must read 15 pages per day.

***text to speech***
 
this is a function that can convert text into a speech.
this feature is a promising feature. if this feature is added, most likely users need an internet connection to use it. With this feature, it is enough to listen to the book without having to read it. if this feature is added it might be placed in the reading options section.
 
 #### Mockups / Examples
here is an example if the feature that I am proposing is added

***finish reading within a certain time***

***text to speech***
if this feature is added it can look like this
![Projbect_1_1-picsay[1].png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc1SNde7ZLgDkPkTqf5mQZGwobch1uSrk4MDkdTS5P7xK/Projbect_1_1-picsay[1].png)

#### BENEFITS

***finish reading within a certain time***
Let's say I want to finish reading a book by a certain date. booky mcbookface should calculate how much I should read each day and then show me in the text where to read to. If I read ahead,  booky mcbookface should re-calculate the amount each day so that I read less each day. If I fall behind, PageTurner should re-calculate the amount each day so that I read more each day.

booky mcbookface should also show a notification that cannot be cleared until I complete the amount of reading for the day. Also,  booky mcbookface should allow me to specify dates for several books and there should be a notification for each book.

This feature is great for students who need to read a textbook for class. If a teacher assigns a book to read, then the students can finish in the right amount of time.

***text to speech***
with this feature, users just have to hear the book they want to read without having to read it again. This feature will also allow blind users to hear their favorite books.with the feature the user also doesn't have to look at the smartphone screen for too long which will make the eyes hurt and redden"

I loaded an ePub (converted with Calibre) and the book opened correctly. I was able to move between pages.

I clicked ""CONTENTS"" and got a list of Chapters.

I clicked on a chapter and got this error message.

could not be loaded because:

net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```

Looking at `toc.ncx`, the corresponding chapter is

```
<navPoint class=""chapter"" id=""num_8"" playOrder=""8"">
   <navLabel>
      <text>Casting of Lots</text>
   </navLabel>
   <content src=""text/part0009.html""/>
</navPoint>
```
Which appears to be correct.  The file `text/part0009.html` also exists.  This error occurs on all chapters in this ePub.  A book from Gutenberg works correctly.

Thanks once again for a great app."
