tejado/Authorizer,open,Yubikey Neo support,[],"I'd really like to see 2FA for logging into the password database, like their is on the normal passwdsafe application. If this was implemented idk if I'd ever use another password manager again. I'd use the normal passwdsafe app, but the USB otg function is something I absolutely love. Also is their any way to donate to this project if so please let me know."
tejado/Authorizer,open,NFC support,[],"I've been working on a similar project that uses NFC and would like to share what I have found, so that we can work together on a solution. My main areas are embedded and hardware, rather than Android.

NFC uses APDU to exchange data, which requires the Android device to emulate a basic smart card. APDU can transfer arbitrary data, and allows an application to be selected by the reader. More info here:

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce

My intention is to build a very small USB keyboard emulator with NFC that can read passwords from an Android phone and type them on the host. It's a shame no off-the-shelf hardware can do this.

There are two options for the reader, an RC522 or a PN532 chip. I'm evaluating both. To control them my plan is to use a XMEGA microcontroller, since I have a fully open source USB stack for it, which includes HID and DFU for bootloading. Also all the development tools are free (GCC) and well supported.

Other options include an ARM CPU. The advantages are that they are physically smaller and slightly cheaper, but the down side is that development support is worse. Actually one other big advantage is that they often come with a USB bootloader factory installed, where as with XMEGA you need a programmer (and probably a programming header).

It would be great to get some feedback on these ideas and also ensure that the hardware can be used with Authorizer."

tejado/Authorizer,open,Merge commits from upstream to Authorizer.,"[Label(name=""Hacktoberfest""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","Authorizer is based on PasswdSafe (https://sourceforge.net/projects/passwdsafe/). 
As PasswdSafe is in active development, a lot of commits from it are not yet integrated into Authorizer.

So it would be good if someone could merge commits from PasswdSafe back to Authorizer. The source of PasswdSafe can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/p/passwdsafe/code/ci/default/tree/"

Can you make it so that if root isn't granted, to tell the user? It would help many new users who think the app is broken or something.  "
tejado/Authorizer,closed,add alternate soft keyboard to input password on the smartphone,[],"When trying to copy the password in the clipboard a warning popup suggests to use the Passwd alternate keyboard, instead of unsecure copy/paste.

Is it possible to implement this feature in Authorizer, too?"
tejado/Authorizer,closed,Support for PasswdSafe Sync,[],"I'm editing HID patch for my device right now and to that day I was using [PasswdSafe by Jeff Harris](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jefftharris.passwdsafe).
Since your project is based on the same sources, can you maybe make it compatible with great addon, for version I metioned earlier, called [PasswdSafe Sync (albo by the same person)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jefftharris.passwdsafe.sync)?
For now, when you open Authorizer you will got security errors when have this apk addon installed immediately after openning your app. It is [open-sourced](https://sourceforge.net/p/passwdsafe/code/ci/default/tree/sync/) too but if you can't make it compatible (by compiling it probably for your fork) then just please remove part of code that is calling it when starting Authorizer because it is impossible to use in my case. If it is only matter of few simple tweaks then I will try to build it myself.

tejado/Authorizer,closed,Passwords should be invisible to the accessibility services,[],"Due to recent attacks, malicious apps that are using the accessibility service can capture all user inputs.

tejado/Authorizer,open,Implement bluetooth keyboard functionality similar to USB keyboard,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hey there,
I don't know whether this is even possible at all nor securely, this would definitely require some investigation, however, if this is doable without security concerns this could be a great feature.

It would need android to be able to behave as a bt keyboard and it would have to be looked at possible security issues like traffic sniffing (reading keys or at least being able to replay them)."

It would be nice to have pass integration since this is a ""standart"" format for password storing (with gpg encryptation) and that works with git

Also there is a project here on github that already integrates this format which i dont remeber the name"
