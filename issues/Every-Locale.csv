sweetiepiggy/Every-Locale,open,Does not work directly with Android 4.2,[],"Since Android 4.2, the CHANGE_CONFIGURATION permission is restricted to system or signed apps(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13440045/android-4-2-filters-out-change-configuration-permission). I was able to make Every Locale a system app by moving the apk from /data/app to /system/app but it'd be nice if this was automated in some way (by F-Droid ?).
