42SK/TVKILL,closed,Any plans to expand to a full universal remote?,[],"Hi @42SK ,

do you have any plans to expand your remote to a full universal remote (i.e. a remote that can do more than just powering down TVs)?

As far as I can tell there is no open source universal remote app available for Android, right?

I found this Irdroid:

https://github.com/Irdroid/Irdroid

But Irdroid seems to require an external IR blaster...

So, would be appreciated if you could comment on this.

What about crowdsourcing more? If the Android IR thing can also receive IR, recording patterns from an actual remote is easy. If not, one could publish a tiny Arduino-based circuit and code to produce necessary data.
