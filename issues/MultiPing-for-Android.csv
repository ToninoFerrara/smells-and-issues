softgearko/MultiPing-for-Android,closed,Add clear DNS resolved IP address to option menu,[],"Request from Jim Tonti.

Thanks for a great program! I use it daily to check connectivity at different locations and when changing between Wi-Fi and 3G.

Perhaps consider adding an option to flush the DNS cache.  E.g. Adding google.com to the list works as long as the DNS lookup returns the same, working IP address. But sometimes they change the address, and MultiPing doesn't know about it, so it keeps hammering an old, non-working address, and reporting timeout.  (At least I think that is what is happening.)

Let me know if I can get you more info in case you haven't seen this.
