tsapree/L9Droid,open,use PopupMenu instead of OptionsMenu on Honecomb and later,[],"In Android 3.0 Google went away from hardware buttons and from settings menu as well.  Instead of OptionsMenu shown by pressing Settings key apps should use action bar.  It is not feasible to add one to this app but using new PopupMenu fits perfectly.

This change replaces old OptionsMenu with PopupMenu if app runs on Android 3.0+
