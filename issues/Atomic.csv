it would be swell to have some additional keys that are in particular useful in IRC:

indrora/Atomic,open,Atomic hangs with weechat IRC relay,[],"Hi,

running weechat-1.9 on Fedora 25 and Atomic 2.1 on Android, yesterday
I was trying to use weechat's IRC relay with atomic:

```
/relay add ipv4.irc.Freenode 9001
/set relay.network.password ""pwd""
```
Then I configured Atomic to connect to the weechat relay. Connect succeeds,
but then it just hangs:

```
[12:05]  Connected to wee.free
[12:05]  Now logging in...
```
I activated relay raw output, and it turns out that weechat gets a request from
Atomic which it never replies to:

```
23.07 12:05 --> [1] irc.Freenode PASS pwd
23.07 12:05 --> [1] irc.Freenode CAP LS
23.07 12:05 NICK corinna
23.07 12:05 USER corinna 8 * :Corinna Vinschen
23.07 12:05 <-- [1] irc.Freenode :weechat.relay.irc CAP nick LS :server-time
23.07 12:05 --> [1] irc.Freenode CAP REQ :
```
From the weechat source it seems that ""CAP REQ :"" will result in a call to
relay_irc_search_server_capability() with an empty string. This in turn
will skip the CAP ACK reply code.

Question is, why does Atomic send ""CAP REQ :"" at all?  Shouldn't it
send ""CAP REQ :server-time"" since that's what it got back from the
""CAP LS"" call?

If I'm correct here, is there a chance for a quick fix?  I really like
Atomic and it's pretty unfortunate that it doesn't work with weechat.


Thanks,
Corinna"

However, with a text editor this task would be a breeze since the field only has one variable for every network - it's just awkward to deal with on the phone.

Steps to reproduce:
- Connect Atomic to the proxy
- Connect another IRC client to the proxy
- Check that both IRC clients correctly see the chosen channel's traffic

indrora/Atomic,open,Support ZNC playback module,[],"This seems like a cool feature - I'll just copy this from the issue tracker of another IRC client:

The advanced playback module [1] makes it possible for IRC clients to avoid undesired repetitive buffer playback. IRC clients may request the module to send a partial buffer playback starting from a certain point of time.

Furthermore, the latest ZNC master [2] has support for persistent query buffers [3]. A client may choose to keep query buffers until they get explicitly closed in the GUI. This can be also easiest done via the same playback module to avoid undesired responses from ZNC [4].

The way it's supposed to work:

```
restart the client
    full buffer playback (/msg *playback play *)
    queries stay open
disconnect & reconnect
    buffer playback of channel & private messages received meanwhile (/msg *playback play )
close a query
    the appropriate query buffer gets cleared (/msg *playback clear )
```

indrora/Atomic,open,Keyboard is inconsistent and could use improvements,[],"Hey,

I hope you don't mind all these issues being opened by me, I'm just interested in making this great client even better. :)

The way the keyboard is handled seems a bit unpolished. Here are a few things I've noticed:

a) It seems to pop up automatically under some circumstances, which can be distracting and annoying, especially when you just want to read. Could be made configurable (e.g. ""Hide keyboard when regaining focus"")

b) If the keyboard is closed, it usually takes two taps on the input box to open it. One selects the box, the other one brings it up. That's confusing. The first tap seems to just focus the input box, but why doesn't it bring up the keyboard?

c). My keyboard has left/right arrow keys that I use to navigate text in the input box. It sometimes happens that when cursor went all the way to the left and I press left again, the focus jumps out of the input box and the arrow keys start switching the channel view instead. Strangely enough, I cannot reproduce this again until I restart the app.

just a tiny usability suggestion this time.

The menu offers three options, Join Channel, Close and Disconnect. It's not entirely clear what ""close"" does. I hit it a couple of times expecting  the program to close, when in fact it leaves the current channel.

Imho a better label for this would be ""Leave Channel"", similar to ""Join Channel"" above it. For queries, it could be labelled ""Close Query"" instead.

Atomic still rocks! :)

indrora/Atomic,open,Atomic gets stuck in a disconnected state,[],"Hello,

several times now I've noticed that switching the device's connectivity (Wifi access points, mobile data to Wifi or back) makes Atomic go crazy for a bit. I can't remember the exact error (will post it here when it happens again), but it came from the SSL backend.

Anyway, when it fails to connect, Atomic seems to be stuck and makes no further attempts to reconnect anymore. The ""Reconnect"" setting is enabled and the interval set to 1 minute. I've waited more than 15 minutes and it did nothing without my intervention. Additionally, when the channel view/server window of this network is opened, the menu shows a (non-functional) 'disconnect' entry, despite it not being connected to begin with. Turning that into a 'connect' entry would make more sense imo.

indrora/Atomic,open,Clicking links can be improved,[],"Hey. This is just a tiny usability improvement. I've often found that I tap a link and nothing happens. Probably because I didn't quite hit it (although I'm sure I was pretty accurate).

Could the tappable around links be increased? Firefox for instance still allows links to be tapped with some degree of fuzziness.

Furthermore, a successfully clicked link should be marked in a different color for a second or so. The reason is to show the user that the tap was successful. That's especially important on slower devices, as it tells the user whether their browser is now loading or if they need to tap again.

Thanks! Great client btw!

indrora/Atomic,closed,Highlights don't trigger a standard notification,"[Label(name=""Interface detail"")]","While the response to highlight is almost fully configurable (sound, vibration and LED independently, plus the highlighting message in the notification bar), and thus can imitate a notification's behavior, it is not an actual notification in the standard Android sense.
This has as a consequence that other programs meant to catch notifications for various purpose (waking up the phone aka ""Active Display""; reading notifications alout with TTS; remotely execute actions; etc) cannot hook into Atomic's highlights.
More over, the ""non-notification"" with the message's text cannot be swiped away (because it's a permanent notification), meaning that to stop the LED from blinking, one has to tap on it and bring up Atomic's foreground activity, which is needlessly disruptive for notifications one wishes to discard.

I suggest that the present mechanism not be removed, as people might still find the ad-hoc configurability convenient (on Android flavors that don't allow configuring notification behavior per-app), but instead that a standard notification be added as an runtime configurable alternative.

Mostly when I am sitting in the train and the connection gets lost, I just continue typing and after some time Atomic reconnects. But when I put the phone on standby (with Atomic in foreground) after connection lost and open it up a few minutes later, in most cases Atomic asks me with a popup if I want to reconnect this server. Event if it already _had_ reconnected in the background. What should I press? Yes? No? Either option does nothing, but I don’t know what to press.

It gets worse if Atomic already reconnected in background and lost connection again. Clicking no does quite nothing and it will not get the conection again. Clicking yes could work … have to try out.

In some cases the backlog will be cleared. I think it’s when I click No on the popup message. I cannot say for sure, most channels aren’t so chatty to test properly. And it happens of course when I have to manually disconnect because Atomic won’t reconnect even with a connection.

"
indrora/Atomic,closed,Side bar with list of conversations / channels,"[Label(name=""Feature Request"")]","### Description

Currently there are two forms of displaying the current channel. Also there are three ways of switching through the channels.
Unfortunately you can either switch easily **or** have overview to all channels. The switch is possible with swiping left/right or (if displayed) touching a channel name left/right to the current one. But if you have a lot of channels it is quite annoying switching from one end to the other.
There is also the conversations view menu, but here you need to touch two times a specific position before the list appears.
### Suggestion

I would like to have a possibility for easy switch while viewing all channels at once. I’ve seen it in many apps where you can swipe in an additional list from either of the side. Try the app “Temaki” (available via F-Droid), where you can swipe in the defined lists on the left side. I find this rather useful and suggest to add this as an option: swiping between channels as usual or swiping to the channel list.

Additionally it would be helpful to see the coloring for the channel items, e.g. blue when there are new messages. Just like it is now for the channel names in the top bar.

This is just a suggestion, I’d like to hear what you all think about it.

It is very useful for links, but not so for very short numbers, hence the timestamps. Maybe you could provide an option to select whether numbers / URLs are linked? It would also help (if possible) to set a minimal number length, because two digits seems quite useless as a phone number.

Atomic crashes when I add the following command to the autosend upon connect option:

This is asking my irc bouncer (znc) to change network. I get the standard ""Unfortunately,  Atomic has stopped"" message. When I remove this command, the client connects fine without crashing.

I am not sure if it is the sending of the message that is directly responsible. The bouncer is doing magic when I issue the command, and it could be this magic that disagrees with atomic:
- Removing the channels for the current bouncer network. The client is expected to close the channel windows.
-  Opening a load of new channels. The client is expected to open windows for these channels.
- Replaying scrollback. I have my bouncer set to replay 50 lines per channel and I have about 10 channels open.

FWIW, the command ""/msg *status help"" works as expected, so that rules out the star in the command from being a source of issues.

"
indrora/Atomic,closed,Nicknames do not preserve their uppercase letters in queries,[],"### Description and steps to reproduce

When I start a private chat (query) with a user whose nickname uses uppercase letters, the query will have the name lowercased. E.g. a query to _NickServ_ will have _nickserv_ as title.
### Impacts

This is at first only annoying because I recognize my contacts also in exact writing, and even if IRC does not distinguish between lower und upper case, it is not what I expect.

The second effect is worse: I use ZNC as bouncer which keeps logs from conversations on the server. When I start e.g. a query with NickServ, ZNC creates a file NickServ_[date].log where all messages from NickServ are logged. But since Atomic starts indeed a conversation with _nickserv_, ZNC also creates a file nickserv_[date].log where just my messages are logged. So the conversation is split into two files, where normally it’s just the one file `NickServ_[date].log`.
### Comments on the bug

It looks to me as if Atomic forcefully lowercases the nickname for queries (because it is written correctly in the user’s list), which is unnecessary and leads to other bugs as described above.
