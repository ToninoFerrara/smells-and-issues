ndleyton/OneTwo,open,"Score Chart, Random Team and  Copy to clipboard function",[],"Hello, I have few proposals for your project and observation you should check

### Proposals

Having; utilized the application for some time to keep track when playing board games with my folks, I think few features can be of value on the application and also suit our necessities.

* Score Chart 
* Random Team  
* Copy to clipboard function (On scores and other things)

**Score chart:** Is a function that will display the result of players participating in a board game in a bar chart form to know the final  score,  and other accessible data.
These can be accomplished by creating a function button that will generate chart after the end of every session of board games.
E.g.tykee score 312, Yu 309, Peter 231, Ming 268, James 121, and Tzu 89.
All these points will be generated on the score chart to show the percentage of all the participants with their score.

**Random Team:** This is a capacity that will serve as the player picker, circumstance whereby 20 people, less or more want to participate in a board game, and five people will be in a team, having the  aggregate of 4 teams, contingent on the type of game
This function will be utilized by including all the player names on the application to generate the team of 4 having five names on a roll of each team. 


     E.g., Team 1 ( tykees, kim, love, ming, and loiz)
          Team 2 ( Debby, Naim, lokey, Thor, and Nima)
          Team 3 ( Ztu, kilo, Maja, Ranui, and khalid)
          Team 4 (Dre, zuez, Luka, Rakitic, and James)
          Team 5 (Ahji, Shopako, luke, Gucci, and Bright)
          
          
**Copy to clipboard:**  This is volatile or alternative storage used for the copying of text from one area to another within the device.
Whereby any generated texts, result or chart data will be copyable. 


### Mockups

The image below shows the score chart with percentages.

 The percentage was derived from



    Player score divided by the overall score then multiply by 100
    
    Nkem 143/899*100= 15.09%
    Love 205/899*100= 22.8%
    tykees 320/899*100= 35.6%
    Koko 231/899*100=25.7%

Copy to clipboard is an abstract function that has effect for users to enjoy, However, ""Tap to copy"" will give users clue of how to use it.

### Benefits

Practically, The three above recommended features will be of added value on the project; Score Chart will fill in as another approach to take the final score on board games As appeared above, the component will involve some interesting information that will demonstrate outright data of all the thing that occurs on the board game events. 

Users could take the screen capture of this information in the wake of adapting all the data on the clipboard and save on another note empower field or send to other members of the game.

Random Team: This component will help in selecting teams, In a circumstance whereby it is required, such as having individuals that need to take an interest in a board game. This element will help in the arbitrary determination of players with no cheats. 

Copy to clipboard will be an exceptionally pleasant change when added to spare all produced information from the application as it will help to incidentally cut, move and paste on another content field to spare all data. 

Another advantage is that it will fill in as the solid methods for getting information put something aside to reference reason as all data currently remains on the application. 

Observation 

The application tends to crash when attempting to alter the score on the counter page.

ndleyton/OneTwo,closed,added a final roll that writes to db,[],
ndleyton/OneTwo,open,Rolling one dice resets all other dice,[],"How to reproduce:
1. Create some dice (I created 10 W100 for Rolemaster character creation)
2. Roll all
3. Roll one

Current behavior:
Rolled dice get new result, all other show max (in my case 100)

Expected behavior:
Other dice keep their results

E.g. Rolemaster character creation allows rerolling dice below 20. Resetting all others makes that quite inconvenient."
ndleyton/OneTwo,open,Feature Request: Allow dice with 0,[],I have games where the D10 ranges from 0-9. Of course it works this way already with using the 10 as 0 but real word d10 also have 0-9
ndleyton/OneTwo,open,Feature Request: More elaborate dice cast animation,[],"For my tast the animation is to short (maybe a 1-2 seconds longer) and could add some flipping or rotating of numbers. (maybe even a sound effect?). Also if the dice  would be bigger it is easier for other people on the table to read the numbers.

Reason: I am often unsure if I already cast the dice when the same numbers come up as every thing is over so quick.

*Thank you for this app. This is the best dice cast app*

ndleyton/OneTwo,open,Change score by an offset,[],"Changing the score of a player is done by swiping up or down. This is adequate for games whose score change by little increments. 

Could it be possible to provide a way to add, for instance, 17 points to a score without having to do the math mentally?"
ndleyton/OneTwo,open,Incompatible with Android 4.2.2,[],"Hi,

I currently can't install this app on a tablet running Android 4.2.2, is there a way you could make it retro-compatible?

Thanks!"
