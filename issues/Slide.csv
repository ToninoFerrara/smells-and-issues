I have a Pixel 2 running Android Pie and the latest beta of Slide. However I also have the official reddit app and a couple other third-party apps installed too.

However despite being disabled sometimes I will still receive notifications simultaneously from both Boost and Slide.

Android version: 8.1.0 (crDroid v4.6)
Device: OnePlus One

After every 2 or so dozen posts, the app stops loading new posts. Swiping out of the post I am viewing and back to the post-list doesn't always help. Sometimes, it shows that the next few posts are loaded, but other times, it gets stuck loading.

Even if the next few posts are loaded, clicking on the post I was on and trying to swipe forward doesn't seem to work. After a few seconds of this behaviour, Slide becomes unresponsive.

ccrama/Slide,open,Multiple issues with mass-hiding seen posts,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Slide version: v5.9-alpha2
Android version: 8.1.0 (crDroid v4.6)
Device: OnePlus One

1. **Mass hiding seen posts causes new posts to not be loaded unless slide is restarted.**
When slide is started up for the first time, a few dozen posts are loaded. If one or more of these posts are marked seen, I long press the hide button to get rid of them. These posts appear to get hidden, but new posts often do not load. [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/9nsvfp/mass_hiding_seen_posts_causes_new_posts_to_not_be/)

2. **Seen posts that are not yet loaded don't get hidden.**
Assuming that the first several posts are seen, only the ones that are visible at the time the app starts up get hidden. For example, assuming that the app loads only posts 1 to 20 at startup, any seen posts between 21 and 50 will not be hidden. If at all the app manages to load posts 21 to 50 after one or more posts between 1 and 20 are hidden (which the app often does not cannot), and I long press the hide button to hide seen posts, the app will not hide any seen posts after post 50 (which was the last of the loaded ones). [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/9nsvfp/mass_hiding_seen_posts_causes_new_posts_to_not_be/)

3. **Hidden posts do not always remain hidden**
Most of the time, when the app is restarted, posts that had been ""hidden forever"" show up again. These posts do not show up in the ""Hidden Posts"" section of my profile when this behaviour occurs. However, sometimes, seen posts truly do remain hidden - they appear in my ""Hidden Posts"" and don't show up again.

Currently when you receive a new comment reply notification while Slide is in the foreground, there will be a snackbar with a button that lets you go directly to said comment. Choosing to go to the comment will leave the message as unread forcing you to go back to the Inbox to mark it as read. Personally I find this annoying.

1. Mark the message as read once you press the Go to post button.

Allow table and code elements to be horizontally scrollable in WebView

Fixes issue https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/issues/2816

This change makes it so subpages (e.g. ""recommended/books"") in Wikis are opened correctly when clicking a link within the HTML

Additionally this change reformats `table` and `code` elements in the HTML to allow them to overflow on the x-axis be scrollable. This is done by injecting some JS that determines if the user touched a `table` or `code` dependent element and disables the ViewPager paging in the native code until their pointers are released from the screen.

Pros: You can scroll `table` and `code` blocks appropriately. This means the entire WebView does not scroll off the x-axis requiring panning before paging. Additionally we do not have to reformat these elements which would lead to them being rendered in an unexpected or unreadable way.
Additionally the way I implemented this allows it to extend to any element easily (written for `table` and `code` was just dropped in last minute and works fine)

Cons: You absolutely cannot page the pager on these elements regardless if they are actually overflowing the view. That logic in the JS would be pretty annoying to write and maintain and I feel it is an edge case of a problem. In cases the entire WikiPage is a `table` or `code` block this would just entirely kill paging, but again I believe that to be an edge case. The biggest problem is if a user is unaware why it is happening.

Let me know how you feel. and if you have any better ideas in your head for this."

- The customCss is set on the Wiki activity statically then accessed from the WikiPage. This is the prevent every fragment from recreating it since it only needs created once per subreddit as it is now

Moved intent extras for internal browsers to LinkUtil class

A byproduct of this change adds the feature request https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/issues/2707

I'll do the run down as always:
* The core of this issue was that `ReaderMode` and custom tabs were not respected after my change for link handling. 
    * I blamed the discrete boolean handling so I moved this out to an enum with an int for the `SettingValues`
* After this refactor, it was an opportune time to move `ReaderMode` out of the types of browser handling and into its own discrete option
    * This option appears below the link handling types. When on, all links with open in `ReaderMode`.
    * When the globe is pressed, the user's link handling type is respected
* I moved some constants for intent extras shared between `ReaderMode` and `Website` into `LinkUtil` since that felt more appropriate
* I consolidated the `LinkUtil.openUrl` logic to avoid duplication of code by calling the superior from the overloaded method
* I created a new method for handling theme-ing internal browsers (reader and internal) to avoid mistakes where one is changed and the other is not

As a result, users' defined link handling types will no longer be the same after this change is pushed. The only value that will continue to be respected will be `ReaderMode` since I decided to use the original preference value for this.

I am PAINSTAKINGLY looking at all the layouts possible in LTR to make sure I did not break LTR modes but they all look fine still after some programatic fixes.

A small list of what happened here:
* Changed usages of `Gravity.RIGHT` to `Gravity.END` (and LEFT to START if it existed)
* Added some logic in `CreateCardView` to also handle END and START on top of LEFT and RIGHT to fully support both RTL and LTR

4. Running Slide with PiP on is SLOW. There's a lot of data rendering all at once. I'll keep experimenting to see what can be improved if anything. If it can't maybe we can dump it.

Here's the change. This will let the user select any browser on their device to use to open links in Slide. This works on any API version.

If a user only has 1 browse, they will not see the option and Slide will continue how it normally does. If they have two, the default browser will be used as it does now until they set one discretely. If they delete their browser they set, it is handled in the LinkUtil.overridePackage method and will fall back to regular behavior.

Additionally, I made it so Intent.setPackage is only run when the package NEEDS overridden and not for every single intent. It only NEEDS it when Slide is the package to be opened or when overriding the browser. Otherwise, it will fallback to default behavior.

The layout for setting a browser type has changed. I moved it out to a RadioGroup and made the actual WebBrowser app selection a pop up. This is a hope of giving more context that these two items are linked.

Not every sub menu will be searchable since some of the individual settings don't make much sense without context. The general design is to add a 'Search' EditView to the main settings page and dynamically update the view beneath it depending on the text that is entered.

Settings sub menus are having most of their functionality moved to a Fragment that accepts an Activity in its constructor. This allows the Fragment to be used by the sub menu Activity as well as by the Settings Activity.

Layout xml files have also been split into a parent/child model. The android:id tags have also been deconflicted since this feature makes it possible to combine two different layouts that contain an element with the same id. Text that is not meant to be clicked has been given an android:tag=""label"" attribute to prevent their parent ViewGroup from being removed.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Guarantee opening an external browser from the internal browser,[],"Partial fix on issue [from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/8cn2ck/slide_locking_up_my_phone/)

When pressing the ""open in external browser"" button from the internal browser, the url is opened in the default link handler. On links like ""https://www.reddit.com/gold/about"", this will cause it to infinitely open back in the Slide app, since that's the default link handler, but that url can only be opened in a WebView.

In internal browsers, this is manageable. When Slide is set to open in an external browser, this would likely cause an infinite loop, locking the phone.

This fix only fixes the button in the internal browser now to get your opinion. I added an intent on a URL that will likely never be link handled. This guarantees the returned package is a browser, not another app (or Slide itself). This may not be desired behavior. I could convert it so if the package to be opened is Slide, we open in an external browser, otherwise, let it be link handled.
Whatever we decide, I can try to convert to the other ways Slide opens urls, to fix the infinite loop

Android version: 7.0

Hi /u/ccrama

I wanted to mention an issue that has been happening for me for at least a year now. Any time I [share a URL](https://i.imgur.com/CJtEgmI.jpg) linking to a gifv or video from Slide to Facebook Messenger, [a blank placeholder of a message](https://i.imgur.com/42XrVnR.jpg) gets shared rather than the URL.

If I choose Copy to Clipboard from the Android share menu instead, it copies the URL just fine. From within the Slide share URL menu,  I've tried choosing any other app to share to and it appears to share only the URL just fine. When sharing a URL from say my web browser to Facebook Messenger, it works fine. 

The strange thing is that if I share a regular image, it formats the share into Messenger as a small thumbnail of the image. Clicking it will open the URL in the default browser, however when a gifv or video is shared, it shows a placeholder instead and tapping it does nothing at all. 

Is this issue somehow related to the data that is shared when a url is shared from Slide? I don't quite understand why sharing a URL from my web browser shares the actual URL every time whereas Slide shares a thumbnail which has an embedded link. Maybe the solution to this issue could be to hardcore only the URL to be shared when the user chooses Share URL?

Here are some examples of what shared URLs looks like when being shared from Slide vs Google Chrome:

I decided to keep the ToolbarScrollHideHandler in this change instead of trying to replace it. It works and there's no reason to remove it. I just worked around it a bit.

The issue explains the problem and resolution pretty well but generally:

- If the content in the adapter for the RecyclerView is being updated on another thread and a user tries to interact with the RecyclerView (scrolling up out of range of the latest content in the adapter), an IndexOutOfBounds would occur
     - To reproduce, reach the end of a subreddit's post listing, press ""Refresh"" and scroll up
- This change does two things to resolve
    - It consolidates the logic for refreshing the view by calling the method SubmissionView.forceRefresh() from the SubmissionAdapter. I explicitly cast the type because I can't fathom why this adapter would be used elsewhere. There are better patterns for this and if you can think of one easily added, let me know
    - The List (?) storng all the Submission data is cleared on forceRefresh, the view is pushed to the top, and the toolbar is forcibly shown. This prevents the user from scrolling into soon-to-be stale data on refresh
        - In this, I added a new method to the SubmissionDisplayer interface to make it easier. All implementations now have a method that lets the View know that the adapter was changed in someway from somewhere else. This is helpful when the changes happen outside of the adapter, but the view is still available (like a hacky MVP).

ccrama/Slide,closed,Android P Support and crash fix,[],"[Reddit issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/82v9wn/crash_in_android_p/)

This adds a new flavor dimension for Android P support, since you can't install an APK targeting a preview build on a release api. If there's a better way, let me know. You can distribute P builds to beta testers now and it can't be used on other API versions, while the current stable version doesn't target P.

The build variants are now named:

- apiStable{gplayFlavor}{buildType}
- apiPreview{gplayFlavor}{buildType}

If you want to switch around the API dimension and Variant (gplay) dimension in the titles let me know (or you can push that up)

This also fixes two bugs: 

1. The first was in `AdBlocker`, the domains were throwing an index out of bounds. I can't tell why, but switching the logic to a worker thread reading a text file (in accordance to the link above the logics post), resolved the crash. (This is the reason for the massive +++, since I used a raw text file with newlines). **I promise you that I did NOT test if this broke ad blocker (do not know how). Only that it causes the app to not crash.**
2. Additionally I fixed a condition in cross posting that felt misplaced. It checked if a value didn't exist on a JSON string and if it didn't, it tried to get a value from it. This would always throw a null pointer. **I did NOT test if this broke cross post (do not know how), only that is no longer throws a null pointer**

Resolving these bugs let the app run on Android P. I verified the P app runs on P and the stable app runs on P and release versions. Please also verify this personally. 

In addition:

- I upgraded gradle to 4.5. This is mostly house keeping since I was touching so much for Android P anyway
- I switched all `compile `usages on dependencies to `implementation` since compile is deprecated. The new gradle will always yell at you about this
- I dropped the specific `buildToolsVersion `declaration from gradle. This no longer needs declared with the Android Plugin for Gradle 3.0.0+
- I'm hard pressed to remember what I changed in `MainActivity` that warranted the code cleanup action to run on it, but that's there too I guess?"

Imgur Content renders based on the extension in the URL. Imgur allows you to put whatever extension you want on a URL and it'll still resolve it and display the image (since the extension doesn't matter to the server). In the scenario mentioned in the Reddit post, a Gif contains a .jpg extension, so Slide renders it as an image, not a Gif. 

A potential solution would be to strip the extension name before opening it, so it renders as generic ""Imgur Content"" and Imgur resolves the type. The listing will still say ""Image"" but that is possibly not solvable since the URL is ""misinformed"".

Android version: 8.0.0

I'm having issues with two behaviors:

1) When the method is run sometimes the first new post is not displayed at the top of the page, but is rather already half cut off. This prompts the user to swipe back to the top (on reflex), which is not far enough away, causing the user to swipe too far and prompt the refresh method instead. 

2) The method only clears read posts up to the first new post. Somehow though, at least in my case, single new posts appear in-between the old ones, making me have to run the method 3-4 times until I actually get to new material. You can imagine how annoying this scales with the first issue: I have to start over rather frequently and lose posts in the process, as they are being displayed and marked as ""read"" right before I accidentally refresh.

Now I saw a similar issue which got closed saying that when repeating the method in some cases no new pages may be found, I presume causing an endless loop. I'd suggest tackling this by simply setting a fixed maximum recursion depth (say 10-20?) after which the app could simply declare ""No new posts"" or something (although even a recursion depth of 3 would already be a game changer).

Hope this makes sense. I'd really appreciate giving this a second thought."

I will add to these notes later and ping you when it's fully updated. I am just finished this and pushing RIGHT before I go somewhere but I'd like to get the implementation of the built-in BottomSheetHelper I wrote in your hands now.

The overarching question is, ""Does this seem like it can reduce complexity or raise it?"". I did not modify (too much) any implementation of the logic on the bottom sheets. I may have added some LongPress actions here and there, but I copy-and-pasted right out of the switch statements.

Ideally, if you want to go with how this is implemented, I would want to go back through, move some common logic somewhere more common, and possible template-ify some of the more common BottomSheet types (e.g., the link sharing one that is used more than once). I also need to put back in the nice ""ontouch"" tinting. Right now there is no feedback when you press and I have no real clue why yet.

There is no need to read all of this since it won't be merged like this, but I would like your thoughts on the Helper class (uses a pseudo-builder-pattern) and how it is written in the code. A pro tip is to look at a single massive diff (where I ripped out the third part BottomSheet), since they are all like that anyway. I'll do my best to point out oddities.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Consolidated sharing logic into a helper class,[],"Fixes [Reddit reported issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/7v2nc4/v58alpha2_released/dtpetg0/)

Originally, the issue was I didn't replace all the `FileProvider `usages across the app when I created `FileUtil`. In these, the old provider name (.MediaView) was being used. I renamed the provider to be the generic `.provider` name to appease TedBottomPicker

In testing this, I ran into some confusion on why there were multiple `shareImage `methods that seemed to vary only slightly and in confusing ways, with the `MediaView#shareImage` logic just straight up not working. The only `shareImage `method I could get to work was the one in `AlbumPager`. This one was the simplest and had the fewest dependencies. When I converted ALL `shareImage `methods to be this same method, they all worked consistently without an issue.

I do not have answers for what special things those other methods were doing and why they were causing failures in sharing when using the `FileUtil#getFileIntent` method. I'm not ruling something out in how I wrote it, I'm just unsure.

Now, this time I DID test:
- Sharing links
- Sharing images
- Sharing from albums
- Sharing from tumblr albums
- Downloading images (notifications still work)
- Downloading from albums / tumblr albums (notifications still work)
- Downloading gifs (notifications still work)

Please verify that me removing those other methods and consolidating them into a single method does not break any required logic. I am not sure about edge cases they could have been resolving.

Additionally, this `Util `package is getting out of hand. Looking for incorrect usage of static helper classes (my new `ShareUtil `class included) could be a project.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Handle app launched from third party app as separate task,[],"Feature change based on https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/issues/2397
Merge conflict with https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/pull/2639. One of these branches will need a specific change to function together  

When Slide is opened from the user's launcher, the app will behave as it always has.
When Slide is opened via an intent from a third party application, a new task will be created in a separate affinity. This task will always start as a new task and omit itself from recents to avoid having two instances of Slide in the recents app screen.

After closing the task, it cannot be re-opened naturally by the user and history is functionally lost.

Tested:
- Opening Slide from launcher behaves as it did previously
- Opening Slide via Intent from third party app does not replace the standard Slide task
- New Slide affinity returns to previously opened app on back press / swipe back / close
- New Slide affinity is removed from recent apps when closed
- Launching another instance of the new Slide affinity after having already launched one does not retain previous history from old instance"

Two code paths exist that create the removed line (I literally have no clue what that is). Both do the exact same thing but one does not verify the ""removedBy"" text is not ""true"". Per the reported issue on the subreddit, ""removed by true"" is displaying to the mod.
Presumably, according to the comment, we should just fallback to the ""Removed by Reddit"" text if this occurs.

As I mentioned in my comment on the issue, I am not 100% convinced my boolean logic is right, but I am fairly sure it is.
In this ""`isNight`"" check, we should not be deciding it's night time if the current `hour` is equal to the `nightEnd` time, because that would indicate night mode remains on for the duration of the `nightEnd` hour.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Bugfix/unescape all links leaving slide,[],"Fixes https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/issues/2615

I made this change fairly quickly, but I think I tested any cases I needed to (I made sure all link handling modes still function correctly). I do not believe there is an issue running `unescapeHtml `on a url that does not need it or already had it ran. The only issue is if that method has considerable overhead, which I also do not think it does for the benefit of always having URLs handled well.

- The change got rid of the, what was essentially, duplicate `Reddit.defaultShare `method in exchange for using the `LinkUtil.openExternally` method. If there is a reason to not do this, let me know, but it seemed like the functionality was the same and internal links are still handled fine.
- Additionally, copying text was moved out to a `LinkUtil.copyUrl` helper method to keep the logic consistent and `unescape `the html in the urls for copying.
- Custom tabs were also not always correctly unescaping the HTML. I moved the logic for opening a custom tab out to a `LinkUtil.openCustomTab` method and forced it to always unescape the HTML if a custom tab can be opened (prevents doing it twice if no custom tab can be opened)

The default behavior of tabview in android is to load the two surrounding tabs simultaneously with the active one. This can cause unnecessarily long wait times and large network usage.

Android version: 7.0 on a galaxy s8.

I'm having this frequent issue where, after a few minutes using the app, a link randomly won't load. This is consistent with usual behaviour (as reddit is sometimes overloaded) but what's changed is that from that point on, no link will load, including both links to pages outside reddit and comment sections, as well as switching subreddits. It just displays a blank page with the loading bar.

It's not related to my connection nor to reddit's state, since loading reddit on the browser will work fine and the problem is immediately resolved by closing Slide  in the multitasking menu and then opening it again.

I can't say for sure when the problem started, but it was somewhere in the last 2 weeks."

ccrama/Slide,open,CookieSyncManager is deprecated from API 22,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi, I think you may already know that `CookieSyncManager` is deprecated since API 21 and CookieManager itself can work well afterwards. ([doc](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieSyncManager.html)). I also found you made code revisions according to this change in [Login.java](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/blob/a218426935a8fdfaf36913495f8c6293bfa64c6d/app/src/main/java/me/ccrama/redditslide/Activities/Login.java#L92). I would like to mention that as it was deprecated since API 21, so I think it is not necessary from VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP. (One API level lower than LOLLIPOP_MR1). :)

I also found this class is also used in [Website.java](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/blob/7f9a998c74972e121b66745b7cecb58aaeb8dbd2/app/src/main/java/me/ccrama/redditslide/Activities/Website.java#L188) without API level checking. I think maybe you missed this location. :)

ccrama/Slide,open,Improving performance by replacing all AsyncTask.execute with executeOnExecutor?,"[Label(name=""feedback"")]","I found AsyncTask is used in many places in Slide and sometimes AsyncTasks are started by `execute` (like in [SettingsSynccit](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/blob/708311347017d42976999425fbd2bbf3fcb8785f/app/src/main/java/me/ccrama/redditslide/Activities/SettingsSynccit.java#L83) and [MainActivity](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/blob/708311347017d42976999425fbd2bbf3fcb8785f/app/src/main/java/me/ccrama/redditslide/Activities/MainActivity.java#L2846)). You may be already aware that AsyncTasks started by this API will be executed on the same single thread. Instead, using `executeOnExecutor` will run the tasks on real multi threads. ([API guide](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html#execute(Params...))) Replacing `execute` with `executeOnExecutor` could make the tasks run on real multiple threads and improve the performance.

By the way, as I found that the minSDK for Slide is now 15 so API level checking before calling executeOnExecutor is not necessary. I found an API level checking is added before a call of executeOnExecutor in [SubsamplingScaleImageView.java](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/blob/7dbcc7f74ea358573ebcad0bcb62b665b1187773/app/src/main/java/me/ccrama/redditslide/Views/SubsamplingScaleImageView.java#L1797) (called through reflection). I think this checking may not be necessary.

Hope this information helps."
ccrama/Slide,open,Clarify which settings are global vs per-account,"[Label(name=""feedback"")]","Some settings, like the main theme, obviously affect the whole app. Others, like `Manage your subreddits` obviously affect only the selected account. For many settings, though, it's not obvious whether they apply per-account.

I suggest grouping settings into `Global settings` and `Per-account settings` at the top level. That could be implemented as headers/subscreens (although I'm not a fan of adding more depth), preference groups (although I'm not sure how that would work with the current General/Appearance/Content/Other groups), or separate links in the left drawer (my preferred solution; per-account settings could be nested under the `You` drop-down).

An alternative to grouping is to make sure all settings are clearly labeled as account or global, but that seems like far more work.

Android version: 8.0

First saw this issue posted couple months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/6rvn5o/notifications_always_reappearing_after_being/

When I get a notification, my notification alert sound occurs twice in quick succession.  I think it's related to below.

When marking the notification as read from the notification pull down, the first ""mark as read"" click removes the ""child"" notification that contains the actual reply text.  The ""main"" Slide notification (which all child notifications bundle into) still appears (the one that says ""You have 1 unread message"" without the actual reply's text).  To remove that notification, I have to click ""mark as read"" again.

It seems like the alert sound happens once for the ""main"" notification and then again for the ""child"" notification.

Extra Info: Since I'm using piggyback notifications, I do have the official app installed.  Within my notification settings, the official reddit app's notifications are set to *not* allow sound"

When the setting is enabled and the app is in multi window mode, only a single column for submissionview, gallery, search, and multireddits should appear. The setting should have no effect if the app is not in multi-window mode. 

The reason this came up is I like to have dual columns in landscape mode. However, when using the app in multi-window mode, the app still considers itself in landscape mode (even if the phone is held in portrait). This happens because the width is greater than the height. This makes it hard to read the submissions as they are shown in dual column mode on a very small width. This setting should make it much easier to browse when using this configuration

Hi all and thanks for a great reddit reader.

I just accidentally uploaded an image to imgur (apparently?) via the share functionality. When sharing an image to Slide in android, it seems to immediately upload it to imgur. Say I'm clumsy or somehow manage to accidentally upload a private image to imgur, that would be very very bad. Currently there seems to be no way to abort this procedure. I strongly propose at least requiring a confirmation button before anything is immediately uploaded to the internet for potentially public viewing. The share button is very prominent when viewing images in the gallery, and then it's just another accidental tap to upload whatever to the internet.

Android version: O Developer Preview 3; Nexus 6P

Now that APIs are finalized for Android O, I wanted to send along the only issue I've run into on the O previews (2 and now 3 as well)

Steps to reproduce:
1) Have 2 accounts added to Slide prior to upgrading to O
2) Upgrade to O
3) Switch accounts to the 2nd account
4) Slide loads the second account with the following:
    i) Proper subreddits in the left slide out
    ii) Incorrect frontpage. The front page is from the 1st account

To get back to the first account:
1) Attempt to switch back to 1st account, but unable to tap it
2) Tap the 2nd account that is already ""loaded""
3) While the account is loading, slide out the left drawer quickly before loading completes
4) Tap the 1st account. This will get you back to the first account as expected.

I have cleared app data with no luck. This actually gives a slightly different behavior adding both accounts on O:

1) Add account #1. All subreddits load as expected
2) Add the 2nd account.
3) Slide acts like its downloading subreddits and syncing colors, however, the list of subreddits stays the same as the first account that was just added. The front page is also for the 1st account.
4) Swapping accounts has the same behavior as in the 2nd example.

ccrama/Slide,closed,404 - Not found issue,[],"Slide version: v5.6.1
Android version: Marshmallow on Zenfone2
Only in system language: Turkish

What happens: any subreddit that includes the letter capital ""I"" in its name is shown incorrectly, or not shown at all. Two examples I can give are IAmA and DIY subreddits. Slide tries to show me AmA and DY subreddits; a subreddit with the name AmA exists, so I am shown a different subreddit. DY does'n exist, so I am shown a 404 error instead. 

Possible reason: I-ı and İ-i are separate letters in Turkish and there is no pair like I-i. So, DIY would be dıy in lowercase. Slide omits ""ı"", which doesn't exist in English, and tries to find dy, and gives a 404 error as a result. Same with IAmA -> ıama -> ama. This is a slide-only problem, it doesn't exist on other reddit clients. 

What's supposed to happen: It should have shown DIY subreddit instead of looking for dıy. The solution would be to make sure that it uses the english language when making capital letters lowercase.

Steps to reproduce to issue: 
1. make the system language turkish.
2. clear application data or reinstall slide (it should be opened first time with a clean cache in turkish)
3. open the app.
4. visit ""dıy"" or ""iama"" subreddit from the list of subscribed subreddits that comes by default on the left menu, or any subscribed subreddit that includes the letter ""I"", or ""ı"". 

Temporary workaround: change the system language to english, open slide, login to your account/accounts and then revert back to turkish system language; correct links to subscribed subreddits persist in that case."

ccrama/Slide,open,Imgur links with a suffix won't load when data saving mode is enabled,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Slide version: 5.5.5 (Play Store), 5.5.7-alpha1 (Play Store), 5.5.2 (F-Droid) 
Android version: 6.0.1

**Steps to reproduce**
- Enable data saving mode (doesn't seem to matter which quality)
- Open an imgur link with a suffix (h, m, l, etc). You can test this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/65pv4g/slide_imgur_test/). 

**Result**
The image won't load, no matter how much you wait. If you then tap the HQ button, it'll display the version for the suffix that was in the URL. For example if you open the M version, it won't display anything, and when you tap the HQ button, it'll display the M version (eG3wRSH**m**.png), instead of the original (eG3wRSH.png). 

Here's what I think is happening: when data saving is enabled, Slide tries to add the appropriate suffix to Imgur links. This works fine if the link itself didn't have a suffix already, but if it does, it won't load anything, because the link now has two suffixes (https://i.imgur.com/eG3wRSHmm.png), and is therefore broken. 

I'm assuming fixing this would involve making Slide check for suffixes when trying to open Imgur links, and removing them, and then applying the appropriate suffix based on the settings. I'm not sure how consistent Imgur URLs are, but I'm assuming it's not impossible, since Sync seems to do exactly that. 

(I wanted to make sure I didn't cause this by breaking something when I [added more data saving options](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide/pull/2326), which is why I tested 5.5.2 from F-Droid. It was reproducible when data saving through Imgur was used). "

Requesting a setting that would allow us to set the depth of the indent for threaded comments - or in other words, the width of those ""colored comment depth indicators"".

The reason I'm suggesting this is because there are a number of phones with curved glass displays, for which screen protectors are made that cover up a small part of this sides of the screen. Because the screen protector can't adhere to the curved portion at the sides of the display, there's a black adhesive border there that covers up a tiny part of the display on all sides...

I have this issue with my OnePlus 3T, and because of the blacked-out 0.5mm of the right side of the screen, the blue ""depth indicator"" is obscured, so I can't tell the difference between the mother and first child comment.

A simple way to fix this would be if I were able to make these coloured indicators just a little bit wider. Hence I'm asking if such a feature is possible!

While developing your application's views you might be specifying attributes in a view's artefact that are not necessary due to the nature of its parent. In this PR, those attributes were replaced by a comment.

I have made a previous validation of the changes and they seem correct.
Unfortunately, this tool is not able keep the original whitespace of the files, so comparison without ignoring whitespace might be confusing.

Setting this to `descendantFocusability=afterDescendants` seems to clear the issue right up.

Android version: 7.1.1

When you go to a linked website, the website loads up in a Chrome Custom Tab. If there is a dropdown menu in the website and you go to click on it to select a menu option, the menu options of the dropdown menu are white. The background of the dialog is also white, as it should be, and hence makes it impossible for the user to read the menu options and chose one. This workaround for this issue is if you open the page externally, the text is readable because the text color is black again. This is what dropdown menus look like in the Chrome Custom Tab:

<h2>How the current data saving mode behaves</h2>

<h3>Testing method</h3>

Slide doesn't show what *exact* link it's loading, and I only have extremely basic programming knowledge, so my method isn't really ideal, but it's the best I could come up with:

- Set data saving mode in Slide, Clear its cache through Settings -> Apps, remove it from recents

- Send a message to myself in Telegram containing a link to a post, and links to different thumbnail/preview versions from reddit/Imgur ([example message](http://pastebin.com/mDUWKHWB))

- Copy the message, and open the post

- Open the image, wait for it to load and then close it

- Paste the message from Telegram in a comment, preview it

- Open every single thumbnail link and see which one loads from cache (and looks the same as the one from the post itself)

My internet is slow enough that I can actually see if it's loading anything from the internet or not. 

As I'm sure you know, reddit has a bunch of previews in the .json file of each post. According to [this](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/compare/2f7837e826cd0be34eabbb1975578545e5f5631c...df671653f2f6b781c08659372be27d765e7598f1#diff-6850f36502467acb3983f3a877321076R583) and the actual .json files, the width of these previews is 108, 216, 320, 640, 960, and 1080. Naturally, they won't be created if the image isn't large enough. As for Imgur, according to [this](https://api.imgur.com/models/image), each thumbnail has a suffix, and they're as following:

suffix | Resolution
-- | -- 
s | 90x90 square
b | 160x160 square
t | 160x160 thumbnail 
m | 320x320 thumbnail
l | 640x640 thumbnail
h | 1024x1024 thumbnail

There also seems to be ""r"", but I'm not entirely sure what it is, so I didn't include it in this test. 

<h3>Results</h3>

I tested using 5 different posts: an i.redd.it image, an Imgur image, an Imgur album, and two non-Imgur/i.redd.it images. Here are the results:

\# | Post | With reddit data saving | With Imgur data saving 
-- | -- | -- | -- 
1 | [i.redd.it](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/5hm3v6) | reddit 640 | reddit 640
2 | [Imgur](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/5hkz4y) | Imgur h (1024) | Imgur m (320)
3 | [Imgur album](https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/5009jn) | Imgur h (1024) | Imgur m (320)
4 | [non-Imgur/i.redd.it 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanPorn/comments/37h28o) | reddit 320 | reddit 320
5 | [non-Imgur/i.redd.it 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/5hpwr0) | reddit 640 | reddit 640

Notes:

- When loading all the different Imgur previews with Imgur data saving mode, you have to tap HQ to actually load the image. You will still get the preview version, not the full version. You can make sure of this by testing the square thumbnail versions. They're extremely small and you can't mistake them for the full version. 

- For the Imgur album, I based my testing on the second image in the album. 

- The fifth post can't be opened with the built-in viewer, but the thumbnail loads, and that's what I based my testing on. 

To summarize the results: 

- For non-Imgur images:
  - the same thing is loaded regardless of which data saving mode is enabled.

  - the 640 version is loaded. However, for the fourth post, the 320 version was loaded, even though a 640 version is available (you can check the .json). 

- For Imgur images:
  - the h (1024) version is loaded with reddit data saving mode, and the m (320) version is loaded with Imgur data saving mode.

<h2>Requests/Suggestions</h2>

My main request is the following: 

The data saving option should be based on what resolution is loaded, not which host it uses. I think something like this will be nice: 

Option | Description
-- | --
Low resolution | Uses reddit 320 and Imgur m (320)
Medium resolution | Uses reddit 640 and Imgur l (640)
High resolution | Uses reddit 1080 and Imgur h (1024)

Naturally, each option will use the next highest resolution preview available as a fallback. IMHO, this is less confusing than the current options, while simultaneously giving more control to the user. 


<h3>Alternative</h3>

If you don't agree with my aforementioned request, I hope you at least consider the following as worth changing:

- The current description of data saving mode is reversed. For non-Imgur images, there is no difference, but for Imgur images, you get a higher resolution with reddit data saving. The opposite is stated in the app. 

- Regardless of which data saving mode is used, Imgur images are loaded from Imgur, and non-Imgur images are loaded from reddit. The current descriptions in the app don't match this.

- There is some inconsistency in which reddit preview is used (like the fourth post I tested). 

<h2></h2>

With all that said, IMO Slide still has the best data saving mode among the apps I've used, and it's one of the main reasons why it's my daily driver.

ccrama/Slide,open,Suggestions for album download notification,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Slide version: 5.5.2

This entire issue is specifically about the ""Download album"" option in the overflow menu of albums; It's not about downloading individual images from an album. 

Currently the notification's progress bar keeps jumping back and forth (I'm guessing it's showing progress for each single image it downloads), and when it's done it says ""Photo saved"". 

My suggestion is to show total download progress, instead of showing it for each image. So if, for example, you're downloading an album of 10 images, and it's currently downloading the 2nd image, it'll say something along the lines of ""2 of 10"", and the progress bar would be at 10%. Then when it moves to the 3rd image, it'll say ""3 or 10"", and the progress bar would be at 20%. And so on. 

Also, the share and delete options only work for the last downloaded image (although I'm not completely sure about delete since it's not working for me), so I think it's better if they're disabled for album downloads. "

Android version: Stock 7.0 on an unrooted Nexus 6P

This issue was created from this reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/5ek41c/deviantart_links_not_working/

When seeing DeviantArt posts from /r/lifeisstrange (and possibly others) on the frontpage, the image viewer doesn't show the image. This happens from the link thumbnail on the frontpage and from individual posts, but not if I tap on the link thumbnail of the post in the subreddit post list. For example, [this post](https://reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/5efz5l/life_is_strange_run_away/) when opened in slide will not show the image.

Description of the exact steps I do from the frontpage:

1. I tap the post thumbnail (this is just the ""link""-thumbnail, I don't actually see a thumbnail of the picture behind the post)
2. The image viewer opens, I now have a semitransparent black overlay with the download- and other buttons at the bottom, back-button at the top, I can still see the front-page through the overlay
3. The progress bar at the top appears and seems to go from 0 to 100 rather quickly, it disappears as it hits 100
4. I would expect the image to be shown anytime now, but nothing happens. With some bigger gifs I often have to wait for a second or two at this point, but the images in question here just never load. I keep staring at my half-overlayed frontpage.

When tapping on the download button in the empty image viewer, a toast says ""Downloading image..."" and I get the download notification saying ""Download in progress"", but the progress bar in the notification is stuck at around 50%. Could be exactly 50%, dunno. It's staying there for now, I'll watch if anything else happens.
Interestingly, when I open the image from the subreddit post list where it actually gets displayed, the same thing happens when I press download - the notification comes, the progress bar gets stuck. This time it's stuck at around 2/5 though."

2. Disconnect Synccit
3. Login with empty fields/invalid accounts.
4. Expected: Receive connection error dialog, Actual: The integration activation popup dialog shows.

This is because the static list `visitedIds` still contains the member ""16noez"". In that case, I'm just removing it from the list. 

I tried to limit the scope of this PR so as not to introduce breaking changes, ie. keeping the AsyncTasks as is and doing the OkHttp calls synchronously in there, using same protocol as before, timeout values, etc. It would be great to consider an okHttp and RxJava for network calls in the future since it would simplify a lot of the stuff done here.

Also slightly related, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/carporn/comments/58ugyi/the_mclaren_f1s_gauges_2048x1365/) image is a jpg on desktop, but the one Slide downloads is a PNG. Though the MIMEtype says jpeg, so it's just the file extension. Not a big issue.

I've experienced this issue where for some images, tapping HQ does indeed load the HQ version, but downloading it doesn't save the high res version. I am using ""Low Quality through Reddit (lower resolution)"" for image data saving.

[Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/555n15/fall_2016_anime_chart_v3_by_neregate/)

If you open this on desktop, you'll see that it's a gigantic 16.4 MB image with a resolution of 1920 x 10762. Slide does indeed load this version when HQ is tapped, but when I download the image, what's saved is 337 KB and has a resolution of 240x1345. 

[Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/55avn5/took_a_turn_down_a_dirt_road_in_uganda_and_came/)

Like the one above, what you get on desktop is a 4608 x 3233 image and a size of 2.1 MB, which is what Slide loads when HQ is tapped, but what gets downloaded is a 1152 x 809, 0.93 MB image.

I also tried both with data saving completely disabled. Both images showed the correct high res versions by default, but the smaller images were downloaded regardless. 

I can look for more examples if that helps. 

EDIT: I've played around with a few more images, and in some cases the opposite happens. What gets downloaded is larger in size and higher in resolution than what gets loaded when HQ is tapped. While I'm personally not bothered by that one, I think it'd be better if both tapping HQ and download the image consistently downloaded the highest resolution possible.

ccrama/Slide,closed,"[Feature request] Option to swipe from right edge for main menu, left edge for subreddit info",[],"Slide version: 5.4.3.7
Android version: 6.0.1

Love the app, but one thing I miss is to be able to quickly swipe to see the subreddits list without reaching the top or right edges of my screen.. In flow for reddit, the swipe gesture works from anywhere, not just left edge. In boost for reddit, there's an option to swap sides, so the subreddits info is swipable from the left, and the main menu and subreddits list is swipable from the right. 

Of course Slide is unique in its own way and that's awesome, but could you please implement either one of these solutions, would make life a lot easier in terms of ergonomics, reaching the left edge of the screen or the top edge to choose subreddits is a lot more difficult than reaching the right edge.. The swipe tabs does work up to an extent, but it's only one subreddit at a time, Hope this can be done.

Thanks and keep up the great work!

Hi

Slide is an awesome app, I use it everyday, however, I find something that annoys me a bit, and would like to report.

Is just a minor thing, so I think it won't be hard to implement, neither will hurt anyone. ;)
1. Change light background color from #dedede to #fafafa, as [guidelines say](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-themes).
2. Update the colors in theme settings to match the [latest Material Design color palette](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-color-palette). I think it has the colors from the very first palette, which was changed a long time ago.
3. Add more options to accent color. Like for primary color. And update their colors to match the [latest Material Design color palette](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-color-palette) too.
4. You could avoid 2 and 3 if you add an option to set custom colors with the hex or rgb code.
5. I think texts are a bit too dark in light theme, so please make them [match the guidelines](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-text-background-colors) (if they don't already).

Thanks in advance and keep up the great work. :)

When I browse list of subreddits in the Discover section, there are few huge gaps between some entries (like PS4 and reactiongifs). It seems there is a problem with formatting with some subs that became so long that their ""card"" is long few screens, because when i tap the ""empty space"" (shown on last screen), i'm redirected to the sub.

Some screens:

There are a couple conditions to reproduce this:
1. The post content and any replies combined cannot be too short or too long. If it is too short, the comment box will be shown without any scrolling necessary (example 1). If it is too long then scrolling will work.
2. The post must be accessed from the front page (I haven't encountered this bug via other means). If accessed via another dialog like your saved posts or a link to a post, then the bug won't happen.

- have a custom sidebar (for example showing a list of your friends, similar to the one in multireddits), or disable it altogether, like on the frontpage. Currently the sidebar just shows that it's trying to load something, but it never actually loads anything.

I happened to stumble upon the link below:

If you open it on desktop, the string %E3%81%AF+%E3%81%8C correctly gets converted to the corresponding unicode characters -> は が

On Slide, the action bar shows the string %E3%81%AF+%E3%81%8C itself, and the search results don't match what you get on desktop. 

Searching は が yourself works fine. It's only in links like the one above that it doesn't work.

Is it possible to add support for such links? Though I do admit this is a small nitpick, since between the 5 Reddit apps I tried, Slide is the only one that even supports opening search links.

I updated the application and realized that you've fixed something related to the profile and advised the users to clear data. At the same time, I realized that some features related to profile weren't working and thought that I was affected. I cleared the app data and tried to login but it kept crashing time and time again without fail. I'm pretty sure I'm on the latest version of the app as I'm a beta user. I'm unable to get a logcat as I have no access to any PC right now until weekend but I've taken a screenshot of the crash log on my phone.

See what I'm talking about here https://www.reddit.com/r/testslideforreddit/comments/52b4xz/test_freakout/

It is supposed to load this GIF: https://i.imgur.com/M4jCzLK.webm

This happens because the extension can be anything and Imgur fixes it automatically. If you click the above link, it will take you to https://i.imgur.com/M4jCzLK.gifv instead.

Edit: Not what I thought at first. Maybe more to it. Here is a log of the event.

That's very cumbersome and destroys the workflow of checking stuff. Can you make the app load the next bunch of posts and their pictures when I scroll further than the last picture?

I made a [post about this on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/5167l2/request_option_for_other_discussions_when_viewing/) but basically the jist of it is: the reddit website on desktop has a tab on every comments page that's titled ""other discussions.""

Clicking on this tab shows you all the other posts on reddit that correspond to that exact link. It only works when the URLs are exactly the same, but there are apps (such as [Search For Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chaitanya.im.searchforreddit&hl=en)) that shows results as long as the core URL is the same. That app specifically seems to use a different method of searching than reddit does.

Either way, however it's implemented, it would be a really cool feature to add into the Slide app itself. When viewing the comments, you'll be able to click on that option and see all the other places on reddit that the link has been posted.

Please read my reddit thread for a more in-depth explanation of this feature.

Just wanted to document it.

If you have Slide open in splitscreen alongside another app and you change the size of the windows, Slide will restart it's activity and refresh the sub you're looking at. So, if I have scrolled over a few sub tabs, then change the window size, Slide will throw me back to the frontpage sub tab and reload--losing my place. Same thing occurs if you had a single subreddit open; Slide will reload and you'll lose your scroll position.

Edit: This might be fixed by doing something with [`onMultiWindowModeChanged(boolean)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onMultiWindowModeChanged%28boolean%29); maybe restore the instance there? Not sure.

So digging into it, I fixed a few issues. 

Results : 

-If you are using comment pane and I assume many people use it, then this loading a sub is 2x faster now. In other cases, there should be no effect. 
- Sorting. Sorting posts in a sub, is now 3-4x times faster, sometimes even 5x. 

When I say x times faster, it is that the number of network calls have reduced by x times and assuming network calls is the biggest factor in latency.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Build is broken?,"[Label(name=""meta"")]","Slide version: 4870426742735d3231ba28586e9bf52aff068410
Android version: 6.0.1

Not sure what's going on, but ever since 9b640a82d7abd0ac61aa915bbcd8c4f073f24544 I've been unable to install Slide. Currently, (on 4870426742735d3231ba28586e9bf52aff068410), if I build a signed apk, I get an Android Studio error: `ExternalSystemException: String index out of range: -97`. The APK gets generated though, and I can install it; upon opening the app, it force closes and below is the log I captured from the crash.

Is it just me? I'm generating a signed apk of DevWithGPlayRelease.

But regardless, there's no option anymore to view xkcd comics in the internal browser or in chrome custom tabs like we were able to before. A toggle would perhaps be welcome.

This PR would fix that issue by changing the ""Always open this host externally"" button to add the link the user clicked on to the list instead of the page the user is currently on.

In my opinion that would be the best solution.

Another solution would be to register a listener for when a new page is loaded (redirect, link click in webbrowser, ...) and check the new url against the open external list every time.
The problem with that would be that it would first open the browser before opening the external app instead of opening the external app directly.

Preface: as pointed out subtly in the video the double _can_ go away if you scroll away and then go back to it but that is still really annoying.

To reproduce (more than one way):
Video 1) Just start hiding stuff, was kinda fixed a few updates ago when the comments were redone but might come up occasionally. Method 2 still works 99%+ of the time.
Video 2) Find a subreddit, scroll to the bottom as fast as you can, before it refreshes or as it's refreshing hit hide on one or more of the bottom most posts, it will duplicate the last post or the first post that's incoming, it may take one or two tries but it happens 99%+ of the time.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Emote improvements,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The major inconvenience with emotes currently is that they cause the rest of all of a paragraph's lines to be as tall as the largest emote in the paragraph. There are a couple of ways this could be handled. Emotes could continue to be inline, but other lines would have their own heights. Alternatively, emotes could be more floating and all be anchored to the left, in order of use, and the non-emote parts of the paragraph be wrapped around in the containing space, flowing around the emotes. Visual:

```
potato [](/emote) potato potato potato
potato potato potato
radish pie
       vvvvvv
+------------------+
| /-\ potato potato|
| |*| potato potato|
| \-/ potato potato|
| radish pie       |
+------------------+
```

and

```
foo [](/emote) bar [](/emote2) [](/emote3) biz
        vvvvvv
+--------------------+
| /-\ XXX ~~~ foo bar|
| |*| X X ~%~ biz    |
| \-/ XXX ~~~        |
+--------------------+
```

I'd expect the former would be a easier to implement, but I don't know Android HTML UI elements. The latter would be closer to how they actually render on Reddit.

It would be nice if you could view the name about the emote by tapping on it. I know there are ways to reveal the source of a post to pull the emote name from it, but a dialog / toast would be a lot more convenient.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Can we have a better upvoting functionality for comments?,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Slide version: 5.4.1
Android version: 6.0 on Moto E2 LTE

Currently, there is an option to have an always floating action bar below every post title. But, when I open any post, in order to upvote a comment  I have to click on that comment to let the action bar first appear and then click on the upvote button. This gets in the way a lot when you want to upvote a lot of comments in that post. What my suggestion is to implement a slide to upvote/downvote functionality. Like the one you have on the narwhal app on iOS. Thus, you can slide a post to the left to upvote and slide to the right to downvote. I feel this is a quicker and easier way to upvote a lot of comments in a single thread. Thanks :)

ccrama/Slide,closed,Suggestions about shadowbox modes,[],"Slide version: 5.4.2alpha3

Comment Shadowbox :

1) Make all links in a comment appear in Shadowbox, right now only the first link appears.

2) A way to see the level of the comment on screen (top level, reply, reply+1...), to be able to figure out if a link is an answer to another.

3) Toggle all comments links/top level comment links only (but that might make it too complicated for the user?).

both :

4) Youtube videos are not obvious, they just appear as a pixelated image. Maybe show a play icon on them or add a type of content/domain description to the title at the bottom (could be useful for other content too, but it probably would take too much space?).

5) Ability to swipe down the expanded bottom description from the whole screen.

6) Crash from time to time, I can't pinpoint any particular action/content that trigger them though.

It happened 2 times, out of maybe 15 backups, first I thought that it was because I upgraded android from 5.02 to 6.0.1 (Slide 5.4.2 at the time) , since it did that just after the upgrade, and that when I restarted the app the issue was still there, but disappeared after a reinstall from scratch. But today it did it again, and it worked fine after restart of the app, so...

ccrama/Slide,closed,Whitelist/blacklist for subreddit content filter,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","Slide version: 5.4.2-alpha3
Android version: 6.0.1
The current content filter (from the overflow button) works as a blacklist, allowing you to choose what content to _hide_. I think having the option to choose what to _show_ would be helpful as well. Technically this is partially doable right now. For example if you only want to see albums you tick everything else and you only get albums. However you can't do this for NSFW content. While you can hide it, you can't choose to only show NSFW content. Having a whitelist along with the currently available blacklist will fix this, and it'd also be easier because you don't have to tick 5 boxes when you only want to see one type of content.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Separate download notification for each image in an album,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Slide version: 5.4.2-alpha3
Android version: 6.0.1

Currently that app shows one download notification per album. So if you download 5 images from the same album. only one notification is created, which keeps getting overwritten. This means you have no idea if the app actually did register your input, after your first image, until it finishes downloading. My suggestion is to treat each image inside the same album individually, creating separate notifications for each of them. 

Also on a slightly related note, are the download notifications set to be dismissed after a few seconds? I've seen some of them disappear after I while, and I wanted to check if that's intended behavior or not before I create an issue for that.

- When the first image is downloaded, the notification appears only after the image has finished downloading. This doesn't always happen, but as seen here, it sometimes does. Even if it does appear early enough to show download progress, it's still not instantaneous in creating the notification. 
- For all the images after, no separate notification is created, and again, no download progress is shown. Unless, this is intended behavior and separate notifications aren't supposed to be made for images in a single album, in which case I'd like to request each image in an album to be separated as well. Although, I'm still facing issues with this even when images aren't from a single album. Sometimes they create a separate notification, sometimes they override the previous one. 

Also, is there supposed to be a timeout for notifications for finished downloads? Occasionally they quickly disappear within seconds. I actually just downloaded an image and stared at the screen for a few seconds, and the notification dismissed itself. Other times, they stay there until I dismiss them.

Hello, would it be possible to change the color of some of the things in posts? Like, if you are using the smaller tag, add a possibility to change its color from white to something else and to change its position instead of forcing it to be on the bottom right of the image. 

Also would it be possible to choose a different default color for subreddit names, instead of making it white, make it be the main theme accent color or a custom color you can choose. Something different than choosing a custom theme for each subreddit separately so that its easier to find from what subreddit the post is from. 

Thanks for this amazing app!

While the new update added separate notifications for each download, it'd be great if each download _in progress_ also showed a separate icon in the status bar as well. Makes it easier to be sure that the download actually started.
Although IMHO it's fine for finished downloads to only show one status bar icon in total, in order to reduce clutter.

If i long press on the subreddit name to bring up the list, instead of number row, it shows the auto complete bar and does allow for swipe input.

- If the `shared_image` dir doesn't exist, create it

When an image is in the process of being downloaded the notification shade becomes extremely laggy. I'm guessing the progress bar is causing issues, since it's not laggy anymore once it finishes downloading. 
Since it currently seems to only shows progress in two states (0% and 100%), it might be a better idea to switch to an indeterminate progress bar (ones that only show that something is in progress without actually showing how much is done) until a better solution for this is found.

The problem is, then, that the buttons aren't always where I expect them to be. My proposed solution is to set each action to the same fixed width (probably the same as their height), then left or right-align them. It would also be nice if the order was user-adjustable.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Better indication when downloading images,"[Label(name=""feedback"")]","Slide version: 5.3.9.5
Android version: 6.0.1

As of right now when you tap the download button of an image a notification appears _after_ it has finished downloading. Depending on image size and internet speed this means you have a few seconds where you're not really sure if you actually tapped the button or not. The effect on the download button itself is pretty easy to miss, especially since your finger is covering most of it.

Also, only one notification appears that only shows the most recent saved image, regardless of how many images you've saved. This means if you download multiple images in quick succession, the only way to be sure that all of them were downloaded successfully is to check actually check the files using a file manager or a gallery app. The alternative is waiting for every image to finish downloading before saving another, which takes too much time. 

My suggestions are:
1. Immediately show a notification when the download button is pressed, indicating that a download _is in progress_, using some kind of progress bar (indeterminate is fine IMO), and then change the notification to what the current version shows once it's done: a text that indicates the picture was saved, and a preview of said photo.
2. Have a separate notification for every image saved. This will allow you to quickly see the last few saved images. This means you don't have to use another app, or wait for every image to finish downloading before queuing the others, to make sure that every image you wanted was saved. Combined with my first suggestion, It also means you'll get a new icon in your status every time you hit the download button, which is a good indication that you did indeed press the download button. This might get out of hand if you save too many pictures without clearing your notifications, so perhaps a maximum number of notifications would be a good idea (although I personally think that's not necessary).

Software layers are too slow, so I'm not using any layer at all.
The idea came from here (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=167551).

This may cause some graphic issues if any of those cards are transparent.
If that's case, maybe we should only replace some of the CardView instances.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Added option for small thumbnails and large thumbnails,"[Label(name=""help wanted"")]","Two things I couldn't fix
- When changing the thumbnail size--the card in Layout Settings doesn't update to reflect the changes between the thumbnail size.
- When changing the thumbnail size, upon returning to the `MainActivity`, the view wouldn't refresh--so you'd still have the old setting. I think this happened when switching between the two sizes only. (i.e. Big -> Small == no refresh; Big/Small -> Big picture cropped == refresh). To mitigate this, I just used the `SettingsTheme.changed = true;` workaround to force a refresh. This was a workaround, and not a fix--but I couldn't figure it out. :|

Random thumbnails flash over posts and titles length sometime changes. (I'm not talking about the extra list flash that happens after a refresh). I'm not sure if this is something you can fix.

If this isn't something you can fix, I say revert the updateViews() commit--and make it so that if the user has Synccit installed, maybe loading a sub should take a little longer to account for Synccit's syncing.

It is a stricter match but I can't think of a domain that has multiple non subdomain prefixes where it would cause confusion. It may impact users if they hadn't decided to type out the full domain, but I would imagine that's rare if it happens at all

## Feature Request
- [x] Add ability to spam posts/comments (_[JRAW Support](https://github.com/ccrama/JRAW/blob/master/src/main/java/net/dean/jraw/managers/ModerationManager.java#L197)_)
- [x] Add ability to distinguish posts (_Not yet supported by JRAW_)
- [x] Add ability to lock posts (_Not yet supported by JRAW_)
- [ ] Add ability to set posts to ""Contest mode"" (_Not yet supported by JRAW_)
- [x] Add ability to ban users
## Enhancement
- [x] When removing a comment/post, don't actually remove any info, just add ""Removed by (moderator name)"" in at the end of the info line. Currently when you remove a comment/post, all the info is deleted and there is no way ""Reapprove it"". Reddit is fun does this (http://i.imgur.com/2a31Voq.png, http://i.imgur.com/pdcU2Ts.png) and it helps us mods out very much. This way, we can review comments/posts deleted by other mods and reapprove them if we have to. It also shows who remove the comment/post, which is again very useful for mods who moderate large subreddits.
- [x] Maybe give an option to remove the ""Are you sure"" pop-ups for Removing/Approving posts/comments? As a default mod, I have to sift through dozens of posts daily and this pop-up wastes a lot of my time (and I'm sure it does for other mods as well) and it would be great it was optional somehow. It really would make a difference.
## Strings
- [x] Position approve/remove for posts/comments consecutively (having items inbetween them seems a bit odd)
- [x] Remove the ""comment"" ending off of ""Approve comment"", ""Distinguish comment"", and ""Sticky comment"". We mods already know that we're performing comment moderator actions so this is redundant. On posts, it already is like this (approve, remove, pin). Also, it doesn't display ""Remove comment"", only ""Remove"" so that's the way I propose they should all be.
- [x] Rename ""Pin"" to ""Sticky"" (for posts). It already uses the word ""Sticky"" for comments so consistency would be great.
## Bug
- [x] When you remove an approved post, it still shows the tag ""Approved by (username)"" next to the title.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Fixed voting states for Comments and Submissions,[],"Trying to fix #1595 

**Edit 1:** So, the Submission voting states seem to be fixed. The _only_ issue that exists with them is that if you open a submission (in comments) on Slide--then go to another device (not Slide) and upvote/downvote that submission from the other device--and then refresh the comments of that submission--the vote count will be correct along with the correct coloring. However, when you leave the submission's comments, the post won't have any indication it was voted on in the submission view until you refresh the submission view.
Not sure if this is worth fixing given the likeliness of that situation happening--I mean, who has two devices open to the same post simultaneously?

**Edit 2:** It feels hacky [given the `ActionStates` AND checking for values in `up`](https://github.com/Nxt3/Slide/blob/voting-state-fix/app/src/main/java/me/ccrama/redditslide/Adapters/CommentAdapter.java#L728), but this works.

On a very regular basis when I attempt to select a post within a single sub, I am taken to the lost that is directly below it. Once this occurs it continues to happen for every post still visible in the sub and the only way to fix it is to force close the app.

To explain further, I will be browsing posts (let's call them A, B, C, D...) And want to open post B. On clicking B I am taken to post C. Once this phenomena occurs, backing out and trying again does the same thing, and from now on clicking any post takes me to the next one (post D now takes me to E, post E now takes me to F).

Edit: this behaviour extends to the individual hide action also. The first few posts works fine then when I go to hide a post the one below it disappears and not the post I actually clicked ""hide"" on.

Frequently, after a bit of use (basically every time I use the app for more than a few minutes), I find that nothing will load. This includes comments and posts.

Perhaps it's spelled wrong, or you do not have access to this subreddit."" If it is a saved sub then only the sub's action bar loads, as well as most of the sidebar, but no posts or comments.

As a note, I am using the app in guest mode. I thought perhaps the problem was with some of my user data, so I uninstalled the Play store app and reinstalled from Fdroid. Same problem, it is making this app almost unusable, which is a shame, because it's a very impressive app. This issue is not specific to 5.3, as I have had the same problem over a number of versions at this point. I can't even fix the problem by backing out and using the confirm dialog to exit. I have to go into my recents menu, swipe the app away and open it again, this works every time to get it loading pages again, but it is quite disruptive.

This topic suggests a way to navigate between same level replies belonging to a parent comment.

Alternative A:
Add up and down arrow ('^' 'v') to long press menu of individual comments, for navigating to previous/next comments of the same level (sibling comments?).

Long press on up arrow to go to first sibling of same level, long press on down arrow to go to last sibling of same level. If already at first sibling comment, long press up arrow brings user to previous level (example: lvl 3-> lvl 2).

Alternately, long pressing on up arrow of any comment simply brings user to previous level (example: lvl 3 -> lvl 2).

Alternative B:
Yet another alternative option is to put it in the new compass menu. Add a new Sibling navigation type. Comment navigation now have 4 arrow buttons, up down left right, plus the compass in the middle. Comment levels start at level 1, in a comment thread, pressing right increases comment level by 1, this makes up and down arrow to jump between comments of that comment level.

Press left to decrease comment level by 1. Long press left to reset comment level to 1.

Pressing up/down on first/last comment of a comment level make it jump to previous/next comment thread, if exist, and reset comment level to 1.

It would be nice if there was an alternative way to pay (paypal, bitcoin, etc).  You could possibly generate product codes, which Slide could then use to enable the features.  This would require compiling a binary with all of the features, but with the premium features locked until a valid product code is entered.

However there could be a few blockers for this:
1) I'm not sure what fdroid's policy on paid features are.  This could break some of their rules
2) I don't know your code base so I have no clue if the premium features are open source.  If they are not open source this will probably earn you a ""red flag"" on your fdroid page.

It would allow us to more accurately determine which things are used the most by users, whilst listening to users who submit feedback and opinions of contributors is no doubt useful, it's a very biased demographic to use to draw conclusions for the whole app as far as usage is concerned.

I found a fairly minor bug. If you rapidly tap a comment (my long press and tap actions are switched) it sometimes results in an expanded comment container that is roughly twice the required size.

Obviously this isn't a very major bug and probably doesn't even show up for most people. I have a strange habit of tapping comments while reading them. :)

Here's the gist of it
- New offline model that stores submissions to the cache directory and stores list of fullnames in the shared preference (reduces RAM use, fixes an ANR)
- Can save multiple states of the same subreddit (stored as subname,millis), subname,0 is always the ""auto-cached"" subreddit, and is saved every time you visit a subreddit
- Autocache with a service, can set the subreddits to cache and the cache time, and it will execute in the background. This will be visible with a progressbar in the notification panel. Caching from the main screen still shows as a dialog popup (to discourage user interaction while caching)
- Manage history screen with the ability to remove cached versions of subreddits, and has autocache settings there too
- New offline MainActivity, less items in the toolbar and the option for getting to the manage history screen
- Override in NetworkUtils for forcing into offline mode (for spotty coverage or if you don't want to use mobile data)
- New spinner on the toolbar in offline mode for selecting the cache time they would like to load

Starting within the last week I've been been having a lot of issues with the UI feezing and getting the ""app not responding"" pop-up. I've noticed the issues popping up mostly in three common places.
- opening image lightbox. The loading animation across the top doesn't doesn't start..
- opening a post view before comments load. The loading circle appears but isn't animated.
- scrolling new image posts into view and thumbnails are trying to load.

I've submitted several stack traces so the Play Store dev console should have further details.

- [x] When pressing 'Load full thread' usually a single comment has too much margin. Selecting the comment removes this. 

Album with examples: https://imgur.com/a/yzpbx
- [x] In 'Your profile', when you unhide an item, it slides out of view (good behavior). When you unsave an item, it stays in the list.
- [x] When you view a post and scroll down, return to the subreddit and view another post, the view doesn't always reset back to top. Cannot replicatie it on a regular basis, it happens on and off.

It's not near to being finished yet & it's completely untested.
#### KNOWN BUGS:
- [ ] It doesn't display the correct subreddits on first start 
- [ ] It does ask if you would like to sub to /r/slide each time on login, also I'm already subbed
- [ ] doesn't display frontpage and all
- [ ] probably a lot of bugs in ReorderSubreddits.java (it's not tested there in any way)
#### TODO:
- [ ] ~~**Port the old subreddit storage method (via Stringbuilder, seperated by commas) in sharedPrefs to the new one**. Currently you have to clear cache to make it working.~~
- [ ] Use FileOutputStream or sqllite instead of SharedPrefs to avoid problems ([Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7944601/saving-a-hash-map-into-shared-preferences))
- [ ] Add sorting of subscription in the object as well
- [ ] Add a better handling for collections
- [ ] Add multireddits to MainActivity
- [ ] Testing, testing, testing. This changes a lot of underlying code and has therefore a high chance of breaking something
- [ ] Add a syncSubscriptionsOverwrite in MainActivity - NotificationAsync. This will allow an automatic subreddit sync. New subreddits will be then displayed at next startup. It wasn't possible before because it would have overwritten if the user deleted a sub. This is fixed now because that is stored in SubscriptionType.HIDDEN
- [ ] Write tests to confirm that everything is working like it should

> > > Reddit offline has this useful panel where you can manage what's offline and what's not synced, the vertical lines represent a post each, my limit is 20 posts per sub, the ones in white are synced but not read like ask Reddit, which only has 1 grey which means only 1 post is read. All other sub's are not cached expect for TIFU, which I haven't read anything. You can re download using the download Button and delete the sub reddit content specifically. That would be great for slide. And of course backing up the sub from the 3dot menu. _You mentioned that every refresh of the sub deletes the content, perhaps you could add an if that checks if there are new post and mark the new posts as NOT BACKED UP and the posts which are already backed up with an arrow icon or something._

ccrama/Slide,closed,Slide fails to load new reddit messages / comments - requires task kill to fix,[],"Slide version:   5.1.0
Android version:  5.0 Galaxy S5

This is a new issue that I'm seeing.  I don't yet have a pattern, but I have a guess at the failure cause.

tl;dr:  slide stops loading new messages or comments.  click on the options button and select discover.  Then say yes when it asks to reconnect.  Or task kill the app and restart.

Issue:  Slide operates normally for all functions, EXCEPT, for loading message comments and new messages from reddit.   From the main screen, if I see a message, I can click on it.  Comments will fail to load.  The message opens up normally, but we see a spinning circle.   If I click on the link or picture, it correctly loads that image or URL.  Same is true if I click on image or URL directly from main view.   If I slide to a new subreddit or use the goto function, the app will not load any message.   Just get the spinning circle.  If I go to my profile, I get an error message:  ""Reddit user could not be retrieved"".  If I click on the Discover button, it says:  ""Reddit refused a request.   Would you like to attempt a re-connect to Reddit?""   Yes/No?    I clicked on Yes, waited at least 75 seconds, but nothing happened.  Next, I clicked on goto subreddit to see if this actually fixed anything and lo and behold, I'm reconnected.   Everything is back to normal now.

While writing this bug report, I've accidentally found this reconnect option.  However, the only way prior was to kill the app and restart it.  On the slide subreddit, I see another person reporting ""Trouble Loading and Refreshing"".   These might be related.

Here is my guess:   /r/all times out after a period of inactivity and you need to refresh.  I think somehow, this is at the root of the issue.   So far when I've seen this (I think), I was in /r/all and put the phone down for something and then returned much later, continuing where I left off.  For my last failure, I had a long thread opened and was part way thru it when I put the phone down.  Picked it back up and started reading again, in the same thread.  Then when I moved back to goto a new message it was no longer working.    THIS IS PURELY SPECULATION on my part.  I've seen this 3-4 times, but have not figured out the pattern.  This speculation is based strictly on my last failure.

Steps to recreate:   Find Text Mode post with an embedded image link.   Click on the picture from the main view, it opens the post.   Decide to view the picture, so click on the picture.   It beeps.  Then click on the embedded imgur URL.   Crash.

I've seen this same problem about 5-8 times, however, I'm unable to reliably reproduce the issue on any one post.   The best I've seen is crashing 2 times in a row, but 2 times is rare.  Never 3.   I've seen this 5-8 times already.    Also, I don't know if the click on the picture before the URL is important, it's just what I typically do.    It does need to be an imgur link as other basic URLs always seem to work.   I'd guess the failure rate to be about 40-50% of said text post messages (it's a guess).

To curtail the returned 0, I set the `headerHeight` to default to `334`--after testing it on a Nexus 4, Pixel C, and Nexus 6P--this seems like a good middle ground to default to.

Furthermore, `mSwipeRefreshLayout.getProgressCircleDiameter()` will always return 0 no matter what; no idea why; instead, I just used `42` as the offset height from the `headerHeight`--which seems to look nice.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Request: Different way to display Imgur image descriptions,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","Slide version: v4.7.5
Android version: v6.0.1

Currently, when viewing an image within an Imgur album, you can view the image description by pressing a ""TT"" looking icon towards the top of the album viewer. Doing so will create a small popup window giving the description.

The issue with this implementation is that - not only does it take focus away from the image - but it covers the image itself.

The image viewer has lots of free space available (or least it does on a 1440x2560 screen - unable to confirm on smaller res screens) that could be utilized for image descriptions. Perhaps a box below or above the image that holds the description could be implemented.

Unfortunately I am not experienced enough with Android to make this change myself.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Reply deletes text if you scroll up or down in the thread,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Slide version: 4.7.3
Android version: 5.0

While this is 100% a bug, please consider this a potential solution / enhancement at the bottom as well.

Pick any subreddit and a thread that has, let's say 50+ replies in it.   Scroll towards the middle of the replies and pick any message.    Long press and then click on Reply.   The reply dialog appears.  Type in some text (or a novel like I did).   Then, decide you want to review the comments a bit more before saving the reply.   Scroll up and down and notice that your reply is deleted.

Here is what I think is happening.   I believe that the app is dynamically loading replies as you scroll to not eat up all the memory.  Once you scroll to a position where the reply-to comment is unloaded, you lose your reply. 

NOTE:  If you reply to the OP, the behavior is different.  In this case, it always remembers the reply and never deletes it regardless of the paging that occurs.  No matter how much you scroll, it maintains your reply.   This is great.

However, the same lost reply occurs if you reply to the OP, then scroll left or right to the next message.  Go one left or one right and it stays put.   Go 2+ messages over and the reply is forever lost.

This is pure conjecture:   I would imagine the the reply is also lost if I'm typing it, then get interrupted, then let the phone timeout and sleep.  Later the phone decides to close the background app.  Start it up again to find your reply gone.  

ENHANCEMENT:   Consider storing the reply in a system buffer that autosaves if I scroll away or if the phone goes to sleep.   If my reply is ever lost, I simply reply again and get back my text.   Even better, when I restart slide, it might ask if I want to continue my reply and put me back in the editor.  Or let me get back to this position without having to search for the reply position.   Imagine that I was in the middle of a 2000 comment thread adding my insignificant comment to this jumble.   It might be hard to find my place again by eyeballing it.

ccrama/Slide,closed,H to V image rotation resets position in Main View,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs reproduction"")]","Slide version: 4.7.3
Android version: 5.0

Similar to issue #1067, but I think this is actually a different issue.

In /r/all at any position in the main list (sorted Hot).   In the main list, Rotate phone to H.  View image.  While viewing, rotate phone back to V.  Back out of the picture and find the position in the main view lost.  It resets back to the top of the list.

Note:  This does not fail if the image is viewed from the Vertical position first.   e.g.   In main list, rotated V, click on picture.  Rotate H, then back out.   No problem.

I can recreate this issue with multiple images, but here are 2 chosen at random:

ccrama/Slide,closed,Android N bugs with links and splitscreen,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Slide version: 4.7.3
Android version: N preview v1

I know it's a first beta of a new version of Android and therefore problems will occur, but I found a couple bugs that should be addressed before N is released, if they're not problems with N its self.

The more major of the two is that any links in comments or sidebars that lead to other posts or subreddits don't work. Link posts that lead to such addresses still work, and all links to lead to pages outside of Reddit work fine. For example, in /r/Android, the sidebar link to /r/AndroidQuestions doesn't work, but the link to their IRC channel works fine.

The other bug is that when running Slide in splitscreen, multi-column becomes enabled, regardless of if it's disabled for portrait mode. Also, when entering split screen, Slide restarts, but goes back to the previously open subreddit. Of course, fixing this will mean implementing proper splitscreen support, which will have to be tested in an emulator if you don't have a Nexus phone.

I'm new to Github, so I wasn't sure if I was supposed to write this as separate posts. Sorry if that's the case.

- [x] Allow setting descriptions, replacing any strings that currently contain newlines (\n)
- [x] Not every setting requires an icon, though for some currently it helps, but with the less ambiguous descriptions this should be less of an issue
- [x] The Post layout page uses the wrong sectioning type
- [x] Pages without any sectioning has the wrong background colour
- [x] There are no item separators
- [ ] Main theme, Post layout and Donate have the wrong transitions
#### Usability
- [x] Rename/describe settings as needed, with the new description area in mind. Some settings currently are not very clear in their actions
- [x] Some settings consist of multiple checkboxes, when they should be radio buttons or dropdowns - for instance the FAB settings, custom tabs/webview/disabled internal browser
- [ ] Some settings are unclear due to lack of description or by being unclear about what would happen on toggle
  - If a setting is an **alternative** then the default position should be off and the overriding option shown, eg “Use webview” replacing “Use chrome custom tabs”, “Monochrome comment depth indicators” replacing colourful, etc.
  - If switching the feature off removes it with no alternative, default on is fine. e.g. disabling confirm exit dialog turns off the confirm exit dialog, which is perfectly expected.
- [ ] Grey out settings that aren't available to use, preferably with a small toast/flash that will appear to explain why they're disabled on press - e.g you need to sign in
- [ ] Merge reorder subreddits and subreddit themes - makes more sense for the user as both are lists of subreddits, and the reorder screen already shows the colour of each, just got to go about getting the functionality of both into one place nicely
- [x] Remove the FAB section, have it as a dropdown select in layout, unless it is planned to see a large amount of function adding, it doesn't currently require its own section
- [x] Replace the CSV nature of filters with individual entries, automatically add another blank field underneath as more are added, makes it far easier to view or delete entries and would go a long way to avoid things like #1169 
#### Change to defaults

Whilst the changes are happening, it's the perfect time to make any changes to defaults, these are going to possibly be a lot more subject to debate than the other points, but here are my opening suggestions that I think are reasonable:
- [x] Notification time → 6/12h, for most waking up every 1h is a little overkill for reddit, majority of users are lurkers
- [ ] Swap the meaning of ""Swap tap and long press..."" over, I think the actions under the current default long press are accessed more than hiding posts are, but can't be sure. Either way it balances out time to action
#### reddit.com preferences interaction

It's rather irritating, but the [preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs) users set have an affect on the data reddit apps receive
- [x] Make these settings per user account (See the discussion in #1026)
- [x] Add a dropdown for the users thumbnail preferences
- [ ] Add an option for compressed link display, though the only affect this has on slide is disabling thumbnails as far as I'm aware, so a disclaimer would have to be added when enabling it that it doesn't change the layout of Slide (though perhaps it could in the future? ie hide empty thumbnail box)
- [ ] Potentially warn the user if their reddit settings are causing thumbnails to not show on first log in
#### Removal of certain settings

This one is another that might cause a bit of stir, but some settings are relatively unnecessary or simply too niche, that their removal would benefit the settings/app as a whole by keeping it more simple, as most users won't really go into depth in the settings much it's important to keep it nice and usable
- General
  - [x] Enter animation - far too subtle an effect to need an animation
  - [x] Alphabetical sidebar - very niche, more confusion than it's worth for most
  - [x] Hide header on drawer - The header is now required for multi-account to function
- Link handling
  - [x] Horizontal album style - Remove from settings and use a button/toggle within the album itself
- Theme
  - [x] Use solid Imageviewer background - Rather quite niche, possibly decrease the transparency on the album view a little, it feels a little too transparent to me but that's rather subjective
- Comments
  - [x] Click user names to view profile - make it not clickable and get rid of this setting

   - It supports 360/3D videos, often pop up on /r/videos etc
2. It won't crash for people on debug builds or without the youtube player installed
3. It removes a .jar from the project, we're open source and the source to it is not available, it may be ugly under the GPL

On top of this streamable support is technically still there for youtube videos, if in the future #1116 gets implemented, it could be run through the normal open method but having youtube domains pre-added to the list, giving the user the choice to open it in the streamable if they wish

When hiding multiple posts using the toolbar icon, I can reliably crash the app. It seems that if you hide several posts, eventually one of them doesn't hide on the UI layer; if you press ""hide"" again on that post--it crashes.

I got a logcat, but it doesn't look like much is there to help; but maybe I'm wrong.

In most cases, I can view a video, gif or article and can rotate the screen without any problem. However, I've found a few posts that cause my main view position to be lost. For instance, after scrolling down 100+ posts, view, rotate and return to the main post list to find myself at the top of the list as if the app just started. This is pretty annoying as I need find my position again.

This post consistently fails: https://reddit.com/r/OSHA/comments/475vrz/luckily_these_workers_were_wearing_their_harnesses/

As a user I hope the ability to select a sort order for multireddits is an intended feature and that the bug lies within the application of the sort order.

It would normally read ""Developer edition"".)

So instead of link flairs, it shows userflairs for the currently logged in user. I haven't tested what happens if you try to set them.

It should show the link flairs ""Help"" and ""Solved""

When opening large images with lots of detail, such as [this comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3nkhm3/the_greatest_enemy/), lots of detail is lost because of the inability to zoom past a point. Sync for Reddit has implemented an open source library called ""Deep Zoom"" (I'm sure you've heard of it), as demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIMltNEAKZY).

There is one assumption in that if something wants multireddits, then they will want to load them if they have not been already.

Commit message:

Slide could get into a state where the SubredditStorage.multireddits
field would be empty due to a network error/some other error.

Attempting to view multireddits would result in a error dialog due to
a NullPointerException due to SubredditStorage.multireddits being null,
which would return you to the main activity. Attempting to view
multireddits again would lead to the exact same message, since there
is no attempt to reload the multireddits in this action.

Adding a getter for multireddis gives an opportunity to load
multireddits if it is null, which should only be if it failed in
the past.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Better text view,[],"(Same as previous pull but merge into master)

Almost finished

I've broken a fair amount of stuff and I need help in getting it all fixed to how it was. I think most of the work will be refactoring the views, and fix possible issues where MakeTextviewClickable was used. Maybe it would be good if this were merged into a separate branch?

This started off as a pull request to display tables, but this has since turned into much more of a refactor due to performance issues.

It looks like the scrolling performance of every list view can be fixed to reducing the nested Linear/Relative layouts in the xml. The diff in comment.xml is an example of this flattening, and it's really been the biggest factor in speeding up scrolling.

MakeTextviewClickable has also been removed, since a new instance is created on every onBindViewHolder call which is really unnecessary and had some funny logic. In doing so I've ripped out and bunch of code of with the old references and replaced it with new code that may or may not work. The most complete example is in CommentAdapter.setViews.

Current features are
- horizontal scrolling code blocks
- tables
- strikethrough
- ordered lists
- nested lists
- increased comment scrolling performance

I aim to solve the following (at least) with this pull:
- #934 done
- #440 done
- #682 done
- #122 done
- #968
- comment scrolling performance (mostly there)

ccrama/Slide,closed,New offline model,[],"I have totally re-written how Submissions are shared between activities. Before, there was a static ArrayList of submissions shared between different activities, but this led to issues of overwriting data (if another subreddit was opened on top of the previous one) and crashes if it had been removed from memory. 

The new model is based on serializing and saving the submission lists to memory and creating the data again at run-time when it's needed, through a helper class called OfflineSubreddit. It supports multireddits with the saving prefix ""multi"", and works even if no internet connection is available.

Also included in this PR is tons of view flattening for the submission views, and tons of speed optimizations for a lag-free submission views. This improves the overall performance of Slide considerably, and leads to easier to read code. 

I also did lots of extraneous bug fixes and crash fixes, including adding a default crash handler on the main thread which will ask the user if they would like to enter offline mode if a connection to Reddit could not be established, or a message saying the request failed. This is not a final solution to the issue, but our future move to RXJava will hopefully be a better solution to this issue.

This also totally re-does the initial tutorial with more intuitive hints popups, and a simple personalization screen before entering the app.

There are lots of changes, so some things may be broken. I have been building off of it for about a week now and have not noticed any major issues yet, so I think it's an appropriate time to merge with Master.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Enhanced text display and performance,[],"This is far from finished so do no merge yet.

I've broken a fair amount of stuff and I need help in getting it all fixed to how it was. I think most of the work will be refactoring the views, and fix possible issues where MakeTextviewClickable was used. Maybe it would be good if this were merged into a separate branch?

This started off as a pull request to display tables, but this has since turned into much more of a refactor due to performance issues.

It looks like the scrolling performance of every list view can be fixed to reducing the nested Linear/Relative layouts in the xml. The diff in comment.xml is an example of this flattening, and it's really been the biggest factor in speeding up scrolling.

MakeTextviewClickable has also been removed, since a new instance is created on every onBindViewHolder call which is really unnecessary and had some funny logic. In doing so I've ripped out and bunch of code of with the old references and replaced it with new code that may or may not work. The most complete example is in CommentAdapter.setViews.

Current features are
- horizontal scrolling code blocks
- tables
- increased comment scrolling performance

I aim to solve the following (at least) with this pull:
- #934 done
- #440 not started
- #682 not started
- comment scrolling performance
- subreddit scrolling performance

I was saddened to see that, while browsing multi-reddits, I'm unable to hide read posts, as the FAB isn't there. It also appears the Shadowbox feature is not in the toolbar. This lack of consistency between ""views"", or lists of Reddit posts, interrupts the user experience.

I heard this was because the sidebar wasn't wanted in multi-reddits, but I feel it could be useful to create an on-the-fly sidebar and fill it with links to subreddits that the multi-reddit is composed of. This may mean that multi-reddits could be listed below subreddit subscriptions in the drawer, and may even allow for more code reuse.

Having only briefly looked at the source, I have no idea how big of challenge this may be.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Refactor submission loading + load more posts when swiping,[],"This was more involved than I though it would be, but I think the end result is less complicated than the diff would show.

Essentially, SubredditPosts.LoadData#onPostExecute was refactored where view specific logic was moved to the SubmissionsDisplay interface. The fragments that need to be updated when more comments are loaded can implement their logic using this interface, which leaves SubredditPosts view agnostic. This allows fragments such as CommentsScreen and SubmissionView to both utilize this class, despite having different requirements.

In addition, when swiping through posts the comments async task is cancelled. Otherwise if you swipe rapidly, and a lot of the tasks are executed and you have to wait a long time for all the previous posts to be loaded.

There was a fair amount of code clean up too, but original logic should be intact.

I probably don't have time for this, but the next step I was going to take was make SubredditPost/MultiredditPost have private constructors, and use a factory to manage each subreddit. This would remove the need for DataShare.sharedSubreddits as its nasty.

Fixes #478, and allows #753 to be fixed pretty easily. Mildly related to #800

ccrama/Slide,closed,Add spoiler functionality,[],"This took longer than I thought... I'm fairly confident it works, but I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks in places since spoilers are consistent between subreddits.

+++ COMMIT MESSAGE +++

This has been tested on subreddits that use
- #s
- /s
- /sp
- /spoiler

as spoiler identifiers. The effect is that the visible text is
displayed as a link, with a whitespace, then the spoiler text
blacked out. When the visible text the clicked, the text of the
spoiler text is reset to white, with the backgroud to stay black.

This is a bit fragile due to the fact that:
1. subreddits use different hrefs for spoiler tags,
2. the visible spoiler text is different per subreddit (and even
   per post).

Accordingly, there are a few assumptions. Firstly:

A1. Spoilers are identified by the presence of the ""title"" attribute
    within the <a> tag.

This seems consitent with the html that comes out of reddit, and
is used in the regex to find each spoiler.

A2. The text within the spoiler does not end in ""]]"".

The whole parsing token is ""]s]]"", but this is relaxed to just ""]]""
since it may or may not happen. Should probably be strengthed in
the future.

A3. If the title attribue is empty, insert ""spoiler"" as the visible
    text.

This is fairly self-explanatory, since having no title will mean
there is nothing to click on.

If more patterns need to be added to identify spoilers, see
ImageType.getImageType(String url).

To prevent collapsing of the children tree when a spoiler link is pressed,
ActiveTextView.spoilerClicked is set to true and is checked in the onClick
function in CommentAdapter for the R.id.content element.

Some amount of code clean up was added, since there were a lot of
inconsitent spacing issues and a few indents which could be reduced
by re-wording if statements.

However, the ViewHolder with the loading spinner still exists in the
RecyclerView, so the exception is thrown since our reported number of
items is {number of posts}, but the RecyclerView has {number of posts + 1}
items.

This solution adds the nomoreposts.xml which replaces loading spinner
with a ""No more posts!"" message, and alters the SubmissionAdapter.getItemCount
method return either 0 or posts.size() + 1 (so it always accounts for
footer element).

Some refactoring was also applied to make code a bit more readable.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Wiki overhaul,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","The current state of wikis leaves a lot to be desired so I'm sure this can be appreciated as necessary. Let's start with the big one.
#### Load only one page at a time

On the opening of a wiki, load only the index page initially: currently the first page sorted alphabetically is loaded first, but to actually display any page in the current implementation **all** wiki pages must first be downloaded, which takes a fair amount of time longer than it should for small wikis, and an unbearable amount of time for large ones.

The index page has all the links to other pages that the subreddit intends to be accessed normally
#### Remove the tabbed interface

It's nice but not appropriate, wikis on reddit tend to be full of old/unused pages and the navigation in the index page will point to the relevant ones, no need to put effort into creating a UI to navigate them manually. In addition as the pages are often dependant on one another unlike subreddits, being able to slide between them isn't always appropriate
#### Fix or remove the table of contents

On reddit.com in a browser it's just a list of html anchors for quick navigation, however in the app implementation it has a few issues.
- It doesn't do anything, pretty self explanatory clicking them doesn't take you to the heading
- An extra level of indentation is only applied to the first child
- Third (and presumably higher) level indentation doesn't display, the first child shows as second level and the next shows as back to first level indentation
- The styling doesn't look very polished, they're displayed as bulleted items with indented options having two bullets, doesn't 'feel' like a table of contents

A few of these can be seen in http://i.imgur.com/U3WdApm.png and https://i.imgur.com/vQdaVcX.png
#### Wikis currently don't take on theme settings

Possible solutions: (1) Have the word ""points"" follow the karma number. (2) Give the comment karma a slightly grey color. (3) Add a separator between the username and the comment karma.
- [x] Add separator-lines between each comment. It's a usability issue, because logically, you should be able to tell where one comment ends and another begins by looking at the color indentations to the left, but realistically, it's confusing without line-separators.

Then apply Html.fromHtml, which produces

blah [[<[x = 1]>]] cats

Using these tokens, the text can be parsed and a monospace font can
be applied.

The transform of the CharSequence to a string in the setCodeFont
method is to simplify the process of search for the tokens, though
it could probably be implemented using the mutable nature of
SpannableStringBuilder. Performance wise there is probably not a huge
hit since we are parsing relatively small amounts of text.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Collapsed comments should remember their state,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","If a comment is collapsed, it should remain collapsed until it is tapped again by the user. Sometimes the comment's state is not stored and can result in some odd and not so user friendly behaviour. For example, say I am reading some long comment thread and I collapse some children to make it easier to navigate. Once I am done, I collapse the parent and move on to the next comment. Later on maybe I come back to this comment thread to reread something (such as when things get meta and you want to understand the reference **or** if you just did not read the comment carefully and forgot), once I open the parent, all it's children automatically open too resulting in a really long thread.

It may be easier if the previously collapsed children remain that way until the user manually opens them again. I don't think opening a parent should automatically open all children.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Collapse a child comment
2. Collapse the child's parent comment
3. Tap to open the parent comment
4. Previously collapsed child comment is now also opened

Relay will take 3 seconds to load comments, while Slide takes 15 seconds.

Again, I am not exaggerating. And the thread I tested had only 500 comments; I can only imagine how much longer Slide will take to load the average AskReddit thread with 3,000+ comments.

In my opinion, that's kinda unintuitive. Since app is fully Material Design, a Floating Action Button in lower right corner would make sense. I'd advise to keep it lower that Google says, because by default they are way too high. It would hide when scrolling down, and show up when scrolling up. But it would be great if current layout would be still an option.
I'm attaching a mockup, sorry for the quality but I forgot to disable compression in Photoshop.

"
ccrama/Slide,closed,[Request] Move thumbnails to left-hand side of post titles,"[Label(name=""cosmetic""), Label(name=""feature request"")]","Because a) images typically convey more information than text and b) most redditors read from left to right, it would improve readability to move (or at least add an option to move) the thumbnails to the left-hand side of the post title when the image mode is set to ""thumbnail"". This change would bring Slide's interface more in-line with the traditional reddit layout and, more importantly, would serve to greatly reduce eye-strain/fatigue on wider displays (assuming, of course, that most users look at images before they read text).

If this is unclear or unconvincing, consider the eye-movement/distance required to go a) from a thumbnail on the far right side of the screen to the beginning of the post title to the end of the post title vs. b) from a thumbnail on the left side of the screen to the beginning of the post title to the end of the post title. In the latter case (with the thumbnail on the left) the user need only scan from left to right (effectively moving in a straight line), whereas in the former case (with the thumbnail on the right, as it currently stands) the user's eyes need to scan from right to left to right again, effectively doubling the amount of eye-movement required. 

This may seem very nitpicky to some, but small usability-improvements go a long way in improving user-experience in extended-use scenarios (with which I'm sure most redditors are familiar with!).

The second time ""restore"" is clicked, it will show the progress bar which will stay at 0%.

ccrama/Slide,closed,App dies when WiFi/Mobile Data is turned off while in app,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Slide Version: 4.3

If mobile data or wifi is turned off while in app, the app will crash and produce the ""restart app"" screen. When ""restart"" is clicked, the app will restart but will not go passed the initial splash screen that says, ""connecting to reddit,"" even when connected to internet. This also happens when the app is opened from the app drawer or by other means besides the ""restart"" button. 
Once the app is stuck on the ""connecting to reddit"" and internet access is removed, the app will not produce the ""slide has crashed"" screen until the device's native ""back"" button is pressed.
If the ""restart"" button is pressed while there is no internet access, the ""uh oh, you are not connected"" dialog will appear as normal, however, the app will still not progress past the ""connecting to reddit"" screen when internet access is recovered.
The only way to restore functionality to the app is to either wipe app data or uninstall and reinstall the app.

EDIT: Upon further testing I have learned that this problem is fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. It must be noted, however, that the app still crashes when an internet connection is removed while in app.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Certain colour combinations results in low contrast text,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""cosmetic"")]","Some colors for custom subreddits colors have the text color incorrect. Especially for cards.

Some examples:

For red, the text color is once again still gray-ish.

ccrama/Slide,closed,Crash after clicking URL in Welcome to reddit message,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""crash"")]","Clicking on the hyperlink in the **Welcome to reddit** message that asks you to **Type in an interest** causes a crash. In a browser, the URL should bring you to a page where you can subscribe to new subreddits (not sure how you'd want to handle that in an app&mdash;I could see it getting ugly fast). I've included a stack trace, since the GitHub reporter didn't show up.

This is the relevant URL: `https://www.reddit.com/subreddits?ref=welcomepm`

ccrama/Slide,closed,fast(er) navigation to specific subreddit action,[],"""Sliding"" from subreddit is very nice, but it would also be good to have some quick navigate-to-subreddit option.  The subreddit list scrolls left/right, but if there are a lot of subreddits in a list, it can be a bit frustratingly slow to get to a particular subreddit.  Relay for Reddit has a drop-down list which one can scroll through really fast.  I'm not suggesting this particular implementation necessarily, but some faster way to navigate to subreddits that are far apart (in a list) would be really nice.

Tapping this brings up the Private Message form (which they can fill out), but hitting send will not actually do anything.

Obviously, you can't send a Private Message when you aren't logged in, but in this case, in terms of UX, I don't think this form should even show up.

I checked the ""Sanitize all input fields"" commit, and although it does not crash due to spaces in the username, it still crashes with an empty username or a non-existent username.

This patch does not crash with empty/invalid usernames, and provides feedback to the user when the username cannot be found.

It does not take care of the subreddit name, which you also sanitized on ""Sanitize all input fields"".

If you like the username solution, I can merge it to the current master and re-submit the pull request.

![Landscape Mode](http://i.imgur.com/qYx7yXy.png)

I took a look through the [reddit source code](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/validator/validator.py#L1471-L1474), which seems to imply that usernames are expected to be between 3 and 20 characters long (lines 1471-1474). Perhaps the username should be moved onto its own line?

``` py

MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 20

- Notifications: Contains the various notification options, from LED color to ringtone to ringtone/vibration/light toggles to update check frequency.
- Default Theme: Small popup, changes global color scheme (light/dark/black, main, accent)
- Subreddit Themes: See #36. Might be able to wait.
- Default Layout: Full-screen, opens the postlist-customization thing to be eventually overhauled as detailed in #29.
- Subreddit Layouts: See #36. Might be able to wait.
- Pro: Contains the subcategories for customizing Multi-Column, Shadowbox, and Night Mode(when it happens, might actually be a good idea to hold off until 4.1 for it), as well as any future things. Might actually be a good idea to just split this up, though, especially considering the tentative F-Droid edition.

# Settings
#### View type
- Card: Self-explanatory. Form over function, with cards on a background, and of course whitespace.
- List: Self-explanatory. Separated only by dividers, with no real between-padding or side-padding. However, some padding may be necessary for the Big Picture and Infobar modes, but not much.
#### Link Preview
- Big Picture: That thing that's big and a picture.
- Infobar: That thing with the thumbnail, link title, and URL, in its own little separate division of the post. This is also what Big Picture reverts to when there's no suitable image.
- Thumbnail only: Only the thumbnail, find some way to also say at least what the domain is if not the important bits of the URL.
#### Big Picture Maximum Aspect Ratio
- Numeric Slider: Ranges from something pretty low to two, as I doubt any Android phones have a 9:21 display. If the bigpic is over the aspect ratio, perform the action defined by the next setting.
#### Big Picture Too-Tall Behavior
- Do Nothing: Display the picture normally anyway. May cause frustration due to vertical comic strips.
- Crop From Top: Crops the picture, leaving the top bit intact.
- Crop From Center: Crops the picture, leaving the center intact.
- Crop From Bottom: You know the drill.
- Revert to Infobar: Same behavior as if there were no suitable image for use in a bigpic at all.
#### Big Picture Info Overlay

That transparent thing with text that gets overlaid over the bigpic.
- Always: Display as long as there's a bigpic.
- Titles Only: Display only if the content being bigpic'd has a title in its metadata.
- Never: Never display the info overlay.
#### Thumbnail Placement
- Left
- Right
#### Action Bar
- Compact: Basically what you have now. Inline with other post metadata info, and few buttons.
- Collapsible: Basically what's present in Sync's smaller-cards and list options. A collapsible bar that appears on a maximum of one post at a time, with more buttons like save and share. Score and comments should still be visible elsewhere.
#### Font Size
- font size selector thing(y|ies)
#### Font Face
- font face selector thing(y|ies)
# Presets
### Compact

- Link Preview: Thumbnail Only
- Action Bar: Collapsible

### Big Cards
- View Type: Card
- Link Preview: Big Picture
- Big Picture Maximum Aspect Ratio: 1.5
- Big Picture Too-Tall Behavior: Revert to Infobar
- Info Overlay: Titles Only
- Action Bar: Compact
- Font Sizes: Arguably Large
