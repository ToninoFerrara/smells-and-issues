Buttink/sick-stache,open,Sick Stache Error when connecting to Sickrage,[],"Hey.

I recently moved over from Sickbeard Alpha torrents to Sickrage and noticed that my sickstache has stopped working after reconfiguring it to the new Sickrage.

Had it running find with Sickbeard Alpha torrents but whatever I do I cannot seem to get it to work with Sickrage.

The error message I get on my S5 is:

Error Retrieving Results
Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Expected
BEGIN_OBJECT but was STRING at line 1 column 1
Path $

I did some googling and found others with a simliar message but with column 10 not 1 and I have tried adding api to the extra path which hasn't fixed it either.

Is this an issue with the app or something I may have configured wrong with Sickrage?

I have keep to always being there when a new pull is put up, mainly because its your guys software now more then mine. Anyway, I will slowly work on this, but just wanted people to know.

I'd change the IP address, but it's such a pain to do that.
