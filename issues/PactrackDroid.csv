firetech/PactrackDroid,closed,Redistrubute or update app on f-droid,[],"Hi @firetech,
This app was last updated 2011 on F-droid.
But there exists a version from 2016 and it still works so I dont see why this hasnt been updated? 

We can submit a request for packaging here https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues incase you cant do it yourself anymore.

Ideally the old version needs to be removed. What do you think?

**edit**: I realize now after reading the source that the reason you havent done it is because the packaged version is not open source because of the API key issue. 

Kindly,"

firetech/PactrackDroid,closed,Useless getBackgroundDataSetting,[],"Dear developers of PactrackDroid,

I am a student majoring in Computer Science. We are trying to collect existing bug reports and fixes of to help detect and fix similar bugs of other active applications.

I have detected that method ConnectivityManager.getBackgroundDataSetting() is used on line 108 in `nu.firetech.android.pactrack.frontend.ConfigView` and line 64 `nu.firetech.android.pactrack.backend.ServiceStarter`.

However, since this method always return true after API level 14 (Noted in [API Guide](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.html#getBackgroundDataSetting%28%29)) and currently the minSDK version of PactrackDroid is 14 so that calling this method is actually useless.
I found that PactrackDroid has been built since 2009, I think this API may be included long time ago, but now it seems to be outdated for your app.

Thanks a lot for your attention. Hope this information is useful for you.

firetech/PactrackDroid,closed,"Handle ""shipment ID:s"" with only one parcel",[],"Some vendors, for instance Komplett.se hands out a ""shipment ID"" instead of a parcel ID, even if the shipment is only one parcel. In such cases it would be trivial to identify the situation and replace the ID with the contained parcel ID instead, making the app happy.

One could even argue that we should add all the separate parcels as separate parcels in the app when a shipment with multiple parcels is supplied.

One example shipment ID: 70702055443354238 (contains parcel ID 00370702055138357347)

firetech/PactrackDroid,closed,Tracking ID:s sometimes needs leading zeroes added,[],"A tracking ID I received recently could not be found in PactrackDroid, but it could be tracked on Postnord's website. After examining the data, it turned out that the tracking ID I'd received lacked two zeroes at the start, making it not match the data received from the API.

We should probably try matching tracking ID:s in the received data by padding with zeroes (before the rest of the ID).

An example for which this happens: 370702055138357347 (should be 00370702055138357347)

firetech/PactrackDroid,closed,RefreshDialog can be recreated by the system,[],"In some cases, it seems that a RefreshDialog can be recreated by the Android system despite setRetainInstance(true). Seen on an LG G3 in a Play Store report. This makes it throw an IllegalStateException(""RefreshDialog.initValues() has not been called.""). However even if a recreation would succeed, the ProgressHandler pointer it sent out before would not be valid, and the dialog would be useless.

A workaround would be to immediately hide the Dialog in that case. Either by changing the IllegalStateException to a warning in the log followed by return null (unsure if that would work) or by dismissing the dialog directly if recreated (mHandler == null).

firetech/PactrackDroid,closed,Double Update actions in two-pane layout (tablets),[],"When viewing a parcel in two-pane layout (on a tablet/xlarge display), both the ""Update"" and ""Update All"" actions are visible in the action bar, with the same icon. A bit confusing.

I see two possible ways of solving this:

1) Set showAsAction for the ""Update All"" menu item to ""never"" in two pane layouts.
2) Change the icon for either of the actions to make the situation clearer. For example adding a '1' to the ""Update"" icon or something else to the ""Update All"" icon.

I would prefer option 2, but I don't feel confident in editing the icons. Option 1, however, can be implemented in just a few minutes.
