budowski/budoist,open,Sync hasn't worked since Mar 7 2015,[],"Hi there,

My Last sync was on Mar 7 2015. If I press Sync Now then I see the pop-up, 'Sync already running'. Sometimes it will start and get to 30% but then budoist will crash. I've tried rebooting the phone. I'm running the latest 1.3.2 version installed through F-Droid on Cynanogenmod 11, although the syncing had already stopped working when I ran Cyanogenmod 10. Backup function still works, so if there is a workaround I'd be happy to hear that too.

budowski/budoist,closed,task due date/time displaying incorrectly,[],"If I enter a task in the app with a due date only, it's fine.  If I include a time with the due date, it displays incorrectly on both the phone app & the website.  

Example: if I create a task on the website and set it as due ""today @ 1200"", it displays on the app (in any list - today, a specific query, etc.) as being due ""tomorrow @ 0100"" (+13h), although it's correctly highlighted with green and listed with the other ""today"" tasks, and if I open it to edit the task the correct time info (""today @ 1200"") is shown.  If I create a task on the phone app with a time as well as date, it either displays on the app the same way (+13h) or occasionally it displays with no due date/time at all, and I can't discern any pattern or reason for why it displays the time/date incorrectly or not at all in this case.

The same task (set for ""today @ 1200"" and created via the app) is displaying as ""yesterday @ 2300"" (-13h) on the website, and highlighted/grouped with the overdue tasks from yesterday.  Editing the task, the time/date info is shown incorrectly as ""yesterday @ 2300"", the same as what's being displayed.

I've checked the basics I can think of - phone's date/time is set correctly, for example - but I don't know anyone else who uses the app so I'm not sure if it's just me or if others are having the same issue.

First thanks for your work and congrats because I think yours is the best todoist client for android:)
One thing I would love you to add if possible is the query ""no date"" to get the tasks without a due date, the same way you can do in the web app.
It's an interesting thing because in the web app is working but it's not listed in the ""Query Syntax"" info.
I create a lot of tasks with no due date because I want them to appear constantly in my queries until I finish them.
In any case I think is a useful addition.

Thanks,
Carlos

After you have checked off that action, it would show the next in the list etc. etc.

This would really help people focus on the task at hand. If the view is synced in the background and the currently shown action isn't now the top in the list it should start back at the top of the list again. I was doing something like this with the Todoist API and a desktop app but it took up too much screen real estate and kept getting hidden.

4. Project view doesn't change
5. Go back to list of projects and back to same project and the list is now up to date

Thanks for providing this. I just saw this from a twitter post by @todoist today and I was almost to the point of starting to create my own android app. If you need help testing at all let me know, I'm using a Xoom tablet and would be happy to help out.
