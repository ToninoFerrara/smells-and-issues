Thank you for your great software, I really waited a long time for a good package manager on Android.

Apt-get (and for me aptitude) are working great. I installed already > 100 packages! (I even compiled the bb demo)

But there's a little drawback that I cannot fix.
When installing openssh-client, ssh wants to create a new user ('ssh'):

```
# adduser ssh 
Adding user `ssh' ...
Adding new group `ssh' ...
adduser: /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 102 ssh' returned error code 1. Exiting.
```

The same thing happens when you try to use `adduser` from the CLI.
Oddly enough `useradd` seem to work neither (fails without output but with error code 1), but /etc/passwd as well as /etc/shadow and /etc/group are editable (and there are no lock files).

jyio/botbrew-gui,open,uncouple superuser and networking privileges,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Using some firewalls, it is possible to deny networking privileges to the superuser. This is problematic because BotBrew, a package manager, requires both privileges to work properly. In the past, this issue was worked around by first downloading files as a regular user, then modifying the system as superuser. This workaround is less than satisfactory because:
- dpkg and apt bring additional complexity to the situation
- it does not actually resolve the _real_ issue of letting the superuser access the network

It might be better to omit the workaround this time and educate users that there is, in fact, a superuser attempting to access the network. Transparency is good.
