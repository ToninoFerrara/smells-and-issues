guardianproject/orweb,open,Orfox screen is immune to capture by screencast,[],"This is quite bizarre.  I wanted to capture the Orfox screen to supply it for bug https://github.com/guardianproject/Orweb/issues/72, but it could not be captured. I'm using the stock screencast tool that originally posted at https://code.google.com/p/androidscreencast/ but apparently it's no longer available.  These are the commands I use to execute it:
```
typeset -a jars=(/usr/local/androidscreencast/*.jar)
java -cp ""$(IFS=:; printf %s ""${jars[*]}"")"" net.srcz.android.screencast.Main . &
```
That has always worked and still works.  But exceptionally, as soon as I put the Orfox window in focus on the phone, screencast freezes on the previous screen and cannot display Orfox.  When I exit Orfox, screencast works again.

It's a strange bug.  Whoever solves this might want to keep good notes on what causes it, because this bug could actually become a security feature.  Imagine an app prompting for some sensitive bit of info that should never be recorded.. an app could invoke the bug herein to deliberately block screen capture."
guardianproject/orweb,open,"""The proxy server is refusing connections"" error on AOS 6 (marshmellow)",[],"This is a new AOS 6 device configured as follows:

Netguard
* runs in white list mode with VPN privileges. This means all apps are blocked by default, and whitelisted apps are forced through Orbot.
* is set to filter all traffic and SOCK5-proxy it to port 9050
* Orbot, Orweb & F-Droid all have the ""apply rules and conditions"" box unticked, so they are exempt from Netguard processing.

Orbot
* does not have VPN privileges
* listens on port 9050

F-Droid
* set to use Orbot (this is simply a toggle and strangely has no port parameter - how does it know to use port 9050?)

Orfox
* has no config option for using Orbot.  No port parameter either.  How can I be sure that Orfox knows what to connect to?

F-Droid and Orfox are both set to bypass Netguard and connect to Orbot.  F-droid works.  Orfox times out when trying to visit check.torproject.org and eventually says ""The proxy server is refusing connections"".

This may be irrelevant, but this command was executed the first time the new phone was USB-attached:

guardianproject/orweb,closed,Javascript request,[],"I think most orweb users and users of any kind of tor products assume the product is secure by default, and the developer community is making sure that that is the case.
One of this default security settings is having javascript disabled, however the reality is that sometimes you will be forced to enable javascript to properly use a site. With tor-browser/firefox this is a no brainer with the use of noscript, in the case of orweb you have to ""manually"" enable the setting.

The problem, the way I see it, is that the setting will remain enabled from then on and it will be like that for every site you surf from then on, unless you disable it.
I'm a fairly technical person and I can see myself disabling the setting and forgetting about it, let alone the regular user who just wants the privacy with no hassle.

Would you guys consider a workaround for this ? One idea is to never save the javascript settings between browser restarts, I'm sure most users can live with the burden of enabling javascript when they need it.

```

In Android 3.2, Orweb simply doesn't proxy its browser. With Orbot not running (or installed), check.torproject.org loads and indicates that the user is not using Tor.

I believe that the problem is this check ([OrbotHelper.java:45](https://github.com/guardianproject/Orweb/blob/master/src/org/torproject/android/OrbotHelper.java#L45)): 

``` java
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 11) 
{
    worked = setWebkitProxyGingerbread(ctx, host, port);
}
else
{
    worked = setWebkitProxyICS(ctx, host, port);
}
```

I think that the check should be for `SDK_INT < 14` -- i.e., below ICS. (This corresponds to the info in this blog post -- http://manojtk.blogspot.ca/2011/01/android-webview-proxy-setting.html -- and its comments. I think that you used that post for the pre-ICS code, and we at Psiphon used it for the ICS+ code.)

Not really important to the fix, but for interest's sake: Why the difference between 3.0/3.1 and 3.2? As can be seen in the stack, 3.0/3.1 results in an uncaught exception in another thread, so the catches at the bottom of `setWebkitProxyICS()` don't get hit and the app crashes. In 3.2, `setWebkitProxyICS()` appears to succeed, returns true, but doesn't actually set the browser proxy. These wacky behaviours caused me to find a bug in Psiphon which led to finding this problem in Orweb.

I'll submit a pull request with this tiny, tiny fix.
