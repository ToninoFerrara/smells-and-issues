Almost always at the first run it works. When it finishes, I manually re-run it. At the second or third run it will usually stop at one of the transitions instead of completing the whole thing to the final 1m. In the rare cases in which the 3 runs all work, closing the app, reopening it and retrying 3 times have only produced the bug.

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,open,Alarm issues on Android 6+,[],In Android 6 it seems that the system kills Bodhi Timer before it can complete the timer. I even have  Battery Optimization disabled in Settings. This is most obvious when using many continuous timers. I've noticed this on stock LG G4 with Android 6 and also a custom ROM on Android 7.
yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,open,Add help to Advanced screen,[],Usually the about screen contains licence info and such so many people don't read it.  It is not very obvious what the advanced timer does so there should be a help menu in that activity.

Such an app doesn't exist anymore; the voice functionality is within the Google app.

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,open,Timer Tone at the end is missing.,[],"Hallo.
First of all I like your timer very much. It's just what I was looking for. Very beautiful.
Since I changed to a new smartphone, WIKO, Android 6.0, the tone at the end of the time interval is missing. The start tone is ok. I have tested all kinds of tones.
Thanks for your help.
Regards.

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,open,Feature Request: Material Design Time Picker,[],"First - I love BodhiTimer! - Job well done!

Second - One of the things I love about BodhiTimer is the visual simplicity and the simplicity in usage.  I just needed to set a new time, and realized how onerous the standard timepicker is in most systems, including BodhiTimer.  For a long time, I've thought there must be a better way to input times, but until I encountered a Material Design time picker, I had no idea what that better way might be.  

The point being, a Material Design time picker would actually align much better with the visual simplicity and the simplicity of BodhiTimer's usage than the current time picker.

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,closed,No timer sound at end of period on Android 4.4.4 (but works on 2.3.7),[],"My old phone has Android 2.3.7 (CyanogenMod-7..2.0-glacier) and BodhiTimer works fine on it, but my new phone has Android 4.4.4 (CyanogenMod 11-20141112-SNAPSHOT-M12-jflte) and there's no sound at the end of the timed period, even though it works fine when I tap ""Test Sound"" in the settings.  I've tried with several different sound options, e.g. Three Bells, Singing Bell, System Sound.  (The Start Sound does work, however.)

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,open,Customize vibration (Feature Request),[],"First of all, I want to thank you for this awesome app! I use it almost everyday, and am really happy with it.

And now a request: I would like to use the app during the day: walking, watching TV, reading, ... And sometimes it's better to use vibration, for not disturbing anybody nor attracting attention. In vibration mode you may get confused with a message or whatever vibration. So...

Could you enable vibration customization? (For example: 3 long vibrations in a row), in such way that you know for sure that it is the app what it is calling your attention.

Thank you very much!

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,closed,background switches when tapping,[],"Background switches betwenn 'circle' and 'bodhi leaf picture' when tapping anywhere on the screen except on the three buttons (options, play/pause, timer).

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,open,timer keeps running while commanded to stop,[],"Using the timere in auto-reload mode, it happens that timer keeps running while it has been manually stopped. Despite the widget showing no countdown, despite the app itself showing no countdown, the bell keeps ringing at interval defined for last timer use.
This is solved by running the timer and stopping it again.
THis is an issue that I have experienced several times, however not been able to find how to reproduce it, not been able to find causes to it.

yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer,closed,Use an open source license,[],"Hi Bhikkhu,

First of all, nice work!  I'm looking forward to using your app once I get an Android device.

Since you mention in the README file that this app is free and open source, I'd like to recommend using one of the GPL licenses (or some other compatible license) so that everything is clear.  Here's a list of approved ""free software"" licenses:
