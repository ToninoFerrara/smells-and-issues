vmihalachi/turbo-editor,open,Two issues when working with large files,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi. 

1) Once scrolling finished, document jumps up and down on the screen for a while. So I loose my concentration while reading the code and have to go one more round and read the code in whole screen. This behavior (I don't know should I call it a bug or feature) is really annoying especially when working with the large files.

2) When I open large files, Turbo Editor becomes not responsive...I've to wait 1-3 seconds after swipe to get document scrolled. Maybe it is not a defect and maybe it is because of the hardware limitations.

Thanks.

Is there a key-combo to switch back to the ""normal"" behaviour?

vmihalachi/turbo-editor,open,Cannot save files from/in linked directories (e.g. /etc),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Turbo Editor opens files from linked directories, but it does not save them (even though the Turbo Editor toast message says that the file was saved).

An example is gps.conf which can be opened from either /etc/gps.conf or from /system/etc/gps.conf (/etc is a symbolic link to /system/etc). Saving /etc/gps.conf will show a toast saying that the file was saved, but re-loading the file shows that it was in fact not saved. Doing the same with /system/etc/gps.conf works as expected.

This bug gets more complicated when files are being opened from another app. When browsing /etc with ES File Explorer, it changes the path automatically to /system/etc and opening gps.conf with Turbo Editor will work without problems. When browsing /etc with Simple Explorer, the path remains /etc and opening gps.conf with Turbo Editor from Simple Explorer will result in the same ill behaviour as when opening /etc/gps.conf directly from within Turbo Editor.
