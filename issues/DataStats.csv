takke/DataStats,open,Block « install » button (again),[],"This seems to be #3 regression, possibly caused by recent f-droid upgrade?

I have DataStats 2.4.1 (2017-09-16) and f-droid 1.3 (2018-08-03), on Android 5.1 .

I fiddled with font size, X-position and other settings but no change.  
I use the burger menu to stop the overlay and `Install` button works again.


Thanks for the nice app & hope this report is useful,

takke/DataStats,closed,Install/Update not possible with release v2.4.1,[],"Hello there! o)

I updated DataStats from v2.2x to 2.4.1 and since then, I am unable to install/update other apps.
The ""Install"" button in the lower right is inaccessible, like there is some layer on top of it, which prevents the tap to go where it belongs. Similar issues have been reported some years ago. Seems something sneaked into the code with the new permissions-thing (I read that in the change log).

I use an Android v4.4.4 Cyanogen Mod Samsung S3 Mini. Uninstalling DataStats takes things back to normal. Unfortunately an older version (which worked fine) cannot be downloaded or re-installed via F-Droid, so I am without this precious little utility for now. o(

Thank you! o)

takke/DataStats,open,[Feature Request] possibility for color change,[],"I (personally) don't need a color-graduation depending on the traffic speed:
![colorold](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7300276/8378788/177c78a2-1c1c-11e5-8cb7-c172f8bb18df.png)

I would be very happy about a static color like 
- red for outgoing, (because the data which is leaving your device could be critical) and
- green for incoming, (because the most of incoming traffic has the user requested before).
- But it also could be a blue/red combination or whatever...

For example:
![colornew](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7300276/8378972/334ff06c-1c1d-11e5-9ce6-683a4730a731.png)

To keep the things simple. I don't talk about the option to change the color to a user-defined one.
I just would be happy with a checkbox-option, (for example), which sets the traffic indicator colors to the (predefined) static ones.

takke/DataStats,open,Preview graphic-glitch on 480x800 pixel-resolution,[],"I have a little glitch on my resolution, (which is the highest on my device): 
Samsung Galaxy S2 ""I9100"" @ 480x800 pixel.

IMHO, because there is a working slider bar, there is no further need for the predefined [XXKB]-buttons.
Removing them, (or reducing them to 2-3 buttons) will prevent such graphic-glitches on smaller devices, too.

What do you think?

takke/DataStats,closed,Logarithm bar misbehavior,[],"I don't want to us the point [_] Logarithm bar, so I disabled that checkbox.

As you can see, there is no logarithm bar on the white colored data traffic. But on the green traffic there comes up a little bar. On the red traffic I get a more or less regular logarithm bar, while that point is definitely disabled.

It's not a big deal. But I hope, it's an interesting information for you, anyway.
"
takke/DataStats,open,Stops working when screen turned off and then back on,[],"Steps I took:
1. Install DataStats ( https://github.com/takke/DataStats )
2. Set DataStats to auto start on boot
3. Reboot*
4. Install WiFi-Automatic ( https://github.com/j4velin/WiFi-Automatic )
5. Reboot
6. Let system stabilize after boot
6. Turn off screen
7. Wait a few seconds
8. Turn on screen
9. DataStats is now frozen at whatever level it was displaying when screen turned off

Now the weird part: I uninstalled WiFi-Automatic and rebooted, and the same symptoms persisted.

I have posted an Issue on the WiFi-Automatic github to see if it is possible that WiFi-Automatic changes something that even after it is uninstalled could affect DataStats?

Before installing WiFi-Automatic, I had been using DataStats without an issue for quite some time.

So what else was changed?  Notice the asterisk at Step # 3 above.  When I rebooted, I manually updated a couple apps (I wasn't trying to run an experiment) and ran (it was already installed) and then uninstalled Wifi Key Recovery ( https://github.com/alt236/Wifi-Key-Recovery---Android ).

I looked at the updated apps, but I don't think they are relevant to the issue.  Since the symptom seems to directly related to the functionality of WiFi-Automatic, I think it's worth checking to see if it could be a part of the problem.  Running Wifi Key Recovery could also be worth seeing if it creates a conflict.

The bottom line is that DataStats is suddenly unusable, as it stops working after every time the screen is cycled off and then back on.

takke/DataStats,open,wanna change the app-icon?,[],"I saw a <slightly> similar-looking logo in a Microsoft® product called Lync™ (or Skype for Business™):

which is a communication software. So I thought DataStats could possibly change its icon to a more ""up"" and ""down"" oriented symbol, if you want to do so.

Please don't get me wrong. I like your logo; this is just the first thing I thought, as I saw the other tray-icon."

takke/DataStats,closed,What does the interpolate mode do exactly?,[],"This is not an usual issue, it's more a question.

You commited this: https://github.com/takke/DataStats/commit/186c586aa4161f8727497247f62a166a103d32c2 to you project and I don't understand exactly, what's the benefit from that change. So I kindly wanted to ask for that.

On https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.takke.datastats you wrote:
""Add interpolation mode (Notice decreasing your battery life)""
Does this mean, that my battery will be empty faster when this feature is set? 
Or that this feature saves battery power - and if so, would you please tell me why (theoretically)? 
Is this just a battery saving calculation method?

Thanks in advance for any response and by the way, thanks for your enthusiasm to make and share such a cool & useful tool like DataStats!

Unfortunately, I am unable to install/update apps from F-Droid when it is active. I see the screen showing me the permissions of the app, but can not click on 'Install'. Looks like the touch event is not registered maybe because of the way DataStats overlays the screen.
