felixb/smsdroid,open,Feature request: Strip Unicode,[],"Nice, plain and simple app, looking a bit dated but gets the job done, but I have a pet peeve.

In my language (Czech), lots of words use diacritics (letters ě, š, č, á, í etc.). Because the text is completely legible even if you use the non-augmented version of the letters in your message, and because the diacritics detracts from the number of characters you can send in one SMS, it's desirable to always write without diacritics. However, the majority of soft keyboards automatically ""fix"" your diacritics-less words. This is desirable in most cases, but not when writing texts, and it's annoying to keep fixing them back.

Most SMS apps have an option to strip Unicode characters before sending (some even do it smartly and only do it if it has an effect, i.e. if the message is longer than 70 characters) and leave only the GSM alphabet, but not SMSdroid, which is the only thing keeping me from using it full-time.

Thank you for considering this feature."
felixb/smsdroid,closed,"""Mark button"" or ""select button"" not working well",[],"
#### Expected behavior

""Mark all"" or ""select"" messages button on SMSdroid app is expected to be used to mark messages for either marking them as read or unread or probably to select messages to delete from the SMS folder

#### Actual behavior
The ""Mark button"" or ""select button"" found on SMSdroid app doesn't mark messages, rather the response it will give is ""mark all as read"" and there's nothing been marked 

#### How to reproduce
Download SMSdroid App from Google play store on your android device, the mark or select button is found at the right top corner of the app, short press or long press the button to use the function, the response is not different from what is said above and no action is taken

felixb/smsdroid,closed,fix database cursor leak in Message.java class ,[],"Fix to issue #31 

I added code to close the database cursor in fetchMmsParts() and put the code in a finally block to make sure it always gets executed.

felixb/smsdroid,closed,resource leak: database cursor not closed,[],"Dear developers,

The database cursor used in the fetchMmsParts() method of Message class is not closed.

https://github.com/felixb/smsdroid/blob/master/SMSdroid/src/main/java/de/ub0r/android/smsdroid/Message.java

```
Cursor cursor = cr.query(URI_PARTS, null, PROJECTION_PARTS[INDEX_MID] + "" = ?"",
                new String[]{String.valueOf(id)}, null);
        if (cursor == null || !cursor.moveToFirst()) {
            return;
        }
```

If the cursor is empty but not null (moveToFirst() returns false), the method will return early and the cursor will be left open. Is it a bug? Thanks.

felixb/smsdroid,closed,Can't receive new SMS,[],"Dear Developer,
I installed a cooked rom on my Asus TF300TG (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2425390).
Unfortunately, the dev of the ROM missed to add an app for sending and receiving SMS.

With SMSDroid I can read the SMSs, but don't receive  at all new SMSs.

App as ZERO Comunicazione (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jb.zerosms&hl=it) works very well, but I prefer open-source apps like yours.

Let me know if you need some other info.

Thank you very much in advance,

"
felixb/smsdroid,closed,Additional Information in SMSdroid (suggestion),[],"Hey,
it would be great if one could see how much characters are left (or already in use) during writing a message E. g.:
for one SMS: 105/160
for more: 167/320

Additional (but I know, that could be more complicated) it would be great to see how much free sms (see the info ""Guthaben: 3/10"" for GMX connector) are left.

Hopefully some good ideas. But its not a showstopper at all.

greetz!

felixb/smsdroid,closed,Option to chose weather to send via WebSMS or natively ,[],"Hi Felix, 

Another thing I'd like to ask is if it possible to choose weather SMSdroid will send message or it will be sent via WebSMS.

Thanks. 
"
felixb/smsdroid,closed,Notifications always active,[],"Hi Felix, 

I've noticed that the notifications are always active, even when SMSdroid is not the default SMS app. Could this be tweaked somehow? 

I've tried to disable them as I occasionally switch to the built in SMS app (because of the dual SIM phone), but then of course I forget to switch notifications back on again, which creates additional problems.

Other messaging apps do not notify me unless they are the default ones for SMS.

I created a new tiled layout for the conversation view, which is similar to the ICS starred contacts layout.

The new layout is disabled by default, users can enable it under the appearance settings.
I also improved the scrolling performance in the list which was a bit slow (especially with the new layout) using the view holder pattern. Feel free to discuss.
