MirakelX/mirakel-android,open,repeated reminders,[],"Hey guys,

I use mirakel a lot and I really like the feature that task could be repeated. It helps me managing my daily workflow. However, for repeated tasks I have to set due date and then those tasks are visible in my task list.

I would like to have some tasks visible in my tasklist only at the date when  those tasks should be done and not all time as it is with repeated tasks. When I set a reminder then the task is visible in my list only at the date when it is reminded.

Could there be added option to have **repeated reminders**?

MirakelX/mirakel-android,open,Crash when attempting to add task to just deleted list,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","How to reproduce:
1. Create new list
2. Switch to list
3. Delete list
4. Close sidebar so you stay on the just deleted list
5. Press add task floating action button
6. Mirakel crashes

There are several solutions available. To me, the sanest seems to be to not allow the sidebar to be closed after deleting the active list so that the user is forced to choose another list.

This issue is probably low priority, as there is no damage or data loss and the crash can be trivially avoided, but I still felt like reporting it.

MirakelX/mirakel-android,open,Sort option: sort alphabetically,[],"Please implement a sort option to sort tasks (**especially completed tasks**) alphabetically.
Use case: **Mirakel Shopping List**
A shopping list has _items_ as tasks (e.g. milk, bread, lettuce, etc.) to be ticked off. When a shopping list is being made, previously completed items can be ""un-completed"" to add them back to the list. It should be quick and easy to find those items. Sorting completed items by creation date or completion date does **not** make it easy to find a single item in a list of ~100 items. Sorting alphabetically by task name **would** make it easy, greatly enhancing Mirakel's flexibility as a _list manager_.
Perhaps the sort by ""Alphabetical"" option could replace the redundant ""Default"" option (which appears to be the exact same as ""Created date""?)

Hi! First of all, thank you for Mirakel, it seems very nice!

But I cannot configure it to work with my home Taskserver, that uses a self-signed certificate.

Using Taskwarrior, ""task sync"" on my pc works with the taskd.trust option set to strict, so the certificate probably works. On Mirakel, however, it doesn't work, showing quite the cryptic message on a Toast (My phone is in portuguese, the message is something like ""Can't create socket! Did you activate the network connection?"". It can be something quite distinct in English, because translations tend to do that). Using logcat, it turns out that the exception description is ""Trust anchor for certification path not found."", which, as far as google tells me, is the error corresponding to a non-trusted certificate. I tried looking in the sources for why this would be happening (and what would I be doing wrong), but without luck. I even tried adding the certificate to the user trusted certificates on Android, but even that didn't work!

Shouldn't my ca.cert have been imported with the config file? Or is there a completely different why this would be happening? Am I doing something really wrong?

I am really looking forward to using Mirakel!

- [ ] From each app screen, press the device's Home key, then re-launch the app from the All Apps screen. 
- [ ] From each app screen, switch to another running app and then return to the app under test using the Recents app switcher. 
- [ ] From each app screen (and dialogs), press the Back button. 
- [ ] From each app screen, rotate the device between landscape and portrait orientation at least three times. 
- [ ] Switch to another app to send the test app into the background. Go to Settings and check whether the test app has any services running while in the background
- [ ] Press the power button to put the device to sleep, then press the power button again to awaken the screen. 
- [ ] Trigger and observe in the notications drawer all types of notifications that the app can display. Expand notifications where applicable (Android 4.1 and higher), and tap all actions offered.

I just had an issue concerning the deletion of annotations (I will open an issue for that, too) and reinstalled (yes, there is no way to remove all tasks at once) Mirakel to delete anything that could harm a problem. 

So I did an initial sync which was ok and fast. But when I synced a second time, it took Mirakel at least twenty seconds to perform the sync. Remember that I only have about 300 tasks and a really fast internet connection in the university. 

Now I synced my CLI version of taskwarrior to watch for changes. And there it is, every task was touched and modified:

Sync successful.  308 changes downloaded.

So what kind of changes are these? Nothing! A short look at one of the modified tasks reveals this as the last modification: 

2015-01-28 18:56:44 No changes made.

And some of them also got a mask change:

2015-01-28 18:56:44 Mask changed from '+++++' to '++++++'.

When there are more tasks to be done than actually can be done, unimportant tasks tend to be ignored.  Often (at least with my work flow) I have some very old tasks with low priority.  I think it would be nice if they would become more important in Mirakel if they are long overdue.

In the editor for a task it could say: ""Increase priority over time"" similar to ""No deadline"" and ""Set a reminder"".  The menu displayed after taping the label would then ask for a number of days after which the priority will be increased by one.  A check-box ""Increase based on deadline"" would also be nice: if not ticked, the increase would be calculated based on creation date, otherwise it will not increase until the deadline flew by with a whooshing sound.

Of course, recurring tasks should be set to their _original_ priority until enough time passes.

As usefulness of this feature certainly isn't true for _all_ tasks this should be a per-task-setting.

Thank you very much in advance!

Various applications now export lists of tasks as VTODO items in an iCalendar file / feed over HTTP

It would be very useful for the Mirakel app to subscribe to such feeds and display the tasks in a read-only mode and maybe cache the contents of each feed for offline use, e.g. to review tasks while the device is in flight mode.

Here are some examples with Mozilla Lightning polling various HTTP sources for tasks:

> This would be very useful. In Astrid, they were very smart about providing smart reminders based on what most needed to be done. If you also added a scheduled start date, you could then have Mirakel provide smart reminders (and congratulations) too, eg if:
> 
> TTC = Time user set to complete the task, eg due date/time minus start date/time
> TSS = Time since task was scheduled to start
> PCD = Percent the task is done (0-1)
> PRI = Priotity set by the user
> 
> Then after the start date, you can figure out whether a tasks progress is behind schedule based on whether PRG is <1 where:
> PRG = PCD / (TSS/TTC)
> 
> So 0-1 is behind schedule. 2 would be that they're going twice the scheduled speed, etc. A relative scale of how much attention the user should give to each task to finish on time (ATT) would then be:
> ATT = (1-PRG)*PRI
> 
> I would LOVE to be able to list tasks by what I should give attention to. It would make life so easy to be able to just look at the task list and know that whatever was up the top, was the task to work on now (making sure that I updated the progress of the task regularly, of course).
> 
> This would also let Mirakel provide smarter reminders, either reminding users of the task with the highest ATT score, or whose priority was neutral to high and PRG was below 1 or similar.

The ""overdue"" meta-list is set by default to ""not before today -1 days"" if you check the meta-list setting, but if you click on the Conditions>Due setting, you can see that the check box actually is ""not after"" and is checked.

The effect is that by default, all tasks that are due in the future show up as overdue, and conversely all tasks due in the past but not completed are dropped from the overdue meta list.

Furthermore, there is a minor display bug for the selector in the Due setting: when opened, ""-1"" is displayed as ""-10"" until you move the wheel.

Hi there,

I've encountered some strange behaviour with the notifications. I've set the Samsung notification sound to a self-installed one, but the app uses the standard Samsung ""Whistle"" sound, no matter what I set. I've tried setting the notification sound to another of Samsung's pre-installed ones, which works flawlessly.

When an online account is deleted (for example in davdroid) mirakel mitigates by migrating the lists to the local account.

Since the option to show the account in the list list ;) is not default, it would be helpful to show a popup that explains to the user what just happened.

When there are a lot of unimportant tasks that _should_ be done, but are ignored for now, one might easily get used to the icon in the notification bar. When that happens a new _important_ task will most likely be overlooked.

This could either be implemented with an option for the task (e. g. ‘[ ] Do not show notification for this task’) or as a global option for notifications (e. g. ‘Only show notification for tasks with a priority from [0]‘).

Thank you very much in advance and keep up the great work!

"
MirakelX/mirakel-android,closed,Mirakel 3 UI Design,"[Label(name=""UI""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello everyone,
I have the honor to redesign the user interface of the coming Mirakel 3. The interface will be designed for the new Andriod L. Therefore I did some early drafts, which are attached here. Now we want to hear your thoughts about this!
Every kind of feedback is welcome. Just comment what you like and don't like, what you would change or what you miss here. And if you have a question about the UI, animations or what else…just ask us!

Before you start, keep in mind that everything is a subject of change. **Nothing is final!** It's just a draft how it could be. And yes, a tablet version is also coming, don't worry! :wink:

:one: 
The whole interface is now cleaned up to focus more on the content. The task cards and the app bar just contain the most important things to see at the first look.
![Start View - Default List](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6615076/3596368/ed6241f4-0cc3-11e4-871b-20ac7f606094.png)

Cause Mirakel has tons of features we need a more button in the app bar. Here you can access everything else. The Menu will later contain tiny icons to spot the content even faster, but first we should be clear what the menu contains.
![Start View - More Menu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6615076/3596370/fdb89c24-0cc3-11e4-96b5-73dc02a8c68f.png)

:two: 
The task lists are now separated into the fixed lists (on top) and the account/user lists (bottom), which change if you switch the account. This is possible via the app bar. If you touch the title you are able to select an account (local, cloud, …) and of course add a new one.
![Task Lists](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6615076/3596374/05ba7dfc-0cc4-11e4-8dfe-a34f59267881.png)

:three: 
Touching a task causes the editing mode. The card gets the focus and grows with a smooth animation. The card now shows only the filled data. To add more data you have to touch the ""add more button"".
![Edit task](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6615076/3596376/0778c40a-0cc4-11e4-9ead-14a5bc2c9581.png)

:four: 
Pressing the green floating ""+"" button causes a nice animation and adds a new task card to the list. The keyboard will be instantly shown, so you just can start typing. Pressing ""next"" jumps trough the textfields.
![Add Task](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6615076/3596377/0f675398-0cc4-11e4-995a-a79b1d205880.png)
![Add Task 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6615076/3596379/1275db5e-0cc4-11e4-9594-eb3fda1cf15b.png)

The search field animates now into the app bar.

I tried creating lists in mirakel that fit the names of the eM Client categories, I tried creating and adding tags to the tasks that fit the eM Client categories.

1. A davdroid account may have multiple calendars, some of them are readonly like birthday-calendar, or shared-calendar. but Mirakel dont know work with which one exactly :( it push each task to a randomly calendar and some of destinations are readonly, leading the sync to fail.
2. Creating lists in Mirakel is not synced never ever! the davdroid-owncloud account have some calendars that could used as list. nothing extra must be allowed. you may want to sync mirakel-lists with taskworior but the owncloud is something else.
3. Mirakel used all davdroid-accounts defined on the device. it is so bad! maybe someone don't want to see tasks in some accounts. it must to define something like calendar app to hide unwanted calendars-tasks-account.
4. In Mirakel if touch delete on an account it will delete the device-scope-defined-account completely without a notice!
5. Loading backup-file lead to re-create all list again, it is good sometimes! but if you create backup before adding a davdroid-account, and after that import the backup, the inbox of davdroid-account disappear!

Disclaimer: I' not a programmer - so I might be wrong:

I check and the call: getLayoutDirection() is available in API17. I'm using Cyanogenmod 10 (most likely based on Android 4.1 API16). Unfortunately my phone is no longer supported, so upgrading is not an option. So if possible maybe there some other function that will allow Jelly Beans owners to use Mirakel Widget? Or at least provide user with a warning that Widget is not supported? Although I like the first solution more :)

If anymore informations are needed, please let me know.

Thanks,

Congratulations on Mirakel!

I would like to propose a Dropbox sync feature as on todo.txt (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todotxt.todotxttouch). They claim to do so (I haven't tried personally), but it would be really nice. I already use taskwarrior+zsh+completions linked with dropbox and it seems to work great the only missing piece I personally feel is syncing with the mobile.

If it is of any help, the code of todotxt is available here: https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-android

Thanks!

I can add a calendar and I can sync the calendar with my Baikal CalDAV server, but if I add/modify or remove a task in mirakel the DAVdroid account does not sync anymore.
The DAVdroid account tells me: ""Sync error"" Sync is currently experiencing problem. It will be back shortly. If I remove the account and add it again, then the syncronisation works (until I modify the tasks again).

MirakelX/mirakel-android,closed,Marking tasks as completed in Mirakel and then syncing with taskwarrior yields unexpected results.,"[Label(name=""Taskwarrior""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""waiting for answer"")]","When I mark a task complete through Mirakel 2.2.1 and sync to my taskd server, task server seems to remove the entries (taskd entry [12])  but doesn't report to my computer task client that the entries are completed.  The result being that the computer, upon sync, recreates the taskd entries. (taskd entry [13]).  

I attempted to sync again with Mirakel after this to see if either of my expected results would happen:  (1) would Mirakel load the new tasks into its own list; or (2) would Mirakel again mark them as complete.  As it turns out Mirakel does neither.  Finding no change in the taskd server, it doesn't recreate the newly added tasks.

Because it wasn't clear to me if this was an issue of Mirakel or taskd & task, I attempted to recreate using two task instances.  In that case, the marking of a task as done was applied  without incident.  If there is any more information I could provide that would be useful, please let me know.

> TSS = Time since task was scheduled to start
> PCD = Percent the task is done (0-1)
> PRI = Priotity set by the user

> Then after the start date, you can figure out whether a tasks progress is behind schedule based on whether PRG is <1 where:
> PRG = PCD / (TSS/TTC)
> 
> So 0-1 is behind schedule. 2 would be that they're going twice the scheduled speed, etc. A relative scale of how much attention the user should give to each task to finish on time (ATT) would then be:

Of course a valid certificate is good for security. Different other apps I've seen that use synchronisation take one of these routes:
- In the account creation dialog: Ask the user if s/he wants to accept any certificate or just valid ones
- After the account creation dialog: Make a first connection to the target, and if a certificate exception occurs, ask the user if s/he wants to trust this certificate.

I hope you can either add this easily or give me a hint where I could add this functionality, since I have some time but not enough to search the codebase for the appropriate locations. If you want me to help, please also point out which branch I should use as the base for my modifications.

MirakelX/mirakel-android,closed,Integrate with existing task accounts,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""wontfix"")]","Feature request

User story:
As Samsung smartphone user I am using 2 existing accounts: (business) tasks from Exchange and (private) local tasks. I am not happy with appearance and usability of S Planner (especially widgets), so I would like to use alternative, open-source solution. For calendar I am using Calendar Widget (from F-droid), for tasks I would like to use Mirakel (also from F-droid). The business tasks should be managed both from smartphone and Outlook, private tasks should be managed from the smartphone only.
=>
If Mirakel would be able to store its data in existing task accounts (and possibly some additional, Mirakel specific task metadata in own database - like S Planner does), it could serve as alternative GUI for existing data, provide unique additional features and could benefit from existing 3rd party synchronization connectors.
