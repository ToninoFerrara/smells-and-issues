GunshipPenguin/open_flood,open,Closes #35,[],
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed, Upgrade Gradle and tools; Add gradle-versions-plugin,[],This project didnt build in my IDE so I updated and cleaned it up some.
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,open,[Suggestion] Undo,[],"I think an Undo button would be nice because, There are times that immediately after picking a color I realize it was the wrong move."
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,open,Replay button on winning end game dialog,[],"It's sometimes desirable to replay a game to find the best route, and sometimes after winning a board. I'm wondering if this code is necessary: https://github.com/GunshipPenguin/open_flood/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/gunshippenguin/openflood/EndGameDialogFragment.java#L111

I think that removing the button is an inconvenience to the player as they must copy the board's seed then input it on the new game dialog after pressing ""New Game."""
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Save game progress on app stop,[],"Currently, the app will lose game progress when the app is stopped (e.g. by pressing the back button). This change makes it possible to restore an ongoing game by saving state to shared preferences on stop, so that the user can continue where they left of.

This change adds [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) as a dependency, which increases the app size by 0.07MB. This dependency is necessary for serialization and deserialization of the board."
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Keep screen on during play,[],This is a minor change to `GameActivity`'s layout which keeps the screen on and prevents undesired dimming as expected for a game.
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,open,Slight pause after winning/losing before dialog pops up,[],"Hi, thank you so much for this game.

A small suggestion - it would be nice if after clearing the board or running out of moves, there was a slight pause before the window pops up over the screen. This would give the user a chance to look at the board and see what boxes were left if they had lost, or to experience the satisfaction of a clear board if they had one. 
Maybe there could be some sort of animation such as a flashing background while this is happening?"

GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Highscore separation,[],"Highscore should be separated for unique combination of grid size and number of colors, otherwise beating highscore is not possible.
Old highscore should be probably discarded with app update.

won for the first time or a new highscore is reached, it will display a

personal best. The highscores are saved separately for every game
mode (combination of number of colors and board size).

When a new highscore is reached:

GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Color mode,[],"Please please give us back the original color mode. The new colors look bright and neat, though. But after a few rounds it hurts my eyes. The original colors were not that beautiful, but they had sharp transitions to each other. At least let the player chose which color mode to pick. Would be a benefit for the game imho :D Great game!

GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,sharing options,[],"An option to ""save"" a board (with or without state) would be nice, so I make another person play the board.

Maybe an option to share a board with another device would be nice so you can send curious boards to friends.

GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Ability to play same board,[],"When player loses he is forced to start a new board. Being able to play the same board may be fun when playing 2 players for example, or to test different strategies. Fun game anyway !
"
GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Colorblind mode,[],"I am fortunately not colorblind myself, but I do use CyanogenMod LiveDisplay which tweaks the gamma settings to make the screen less bright at night. At these moments, I find it hard to tell screen colors apart. Some way to tell different colors apart would be nice.

Frozen Bubble solves this by drawing small characters over the bubbles, but it's hard to tell if this would work for Open Flood. Perhaps numbers or something completely different may work better.

See the image below for how Frozen Bubble does it:

GunshipPenguin/open_flood,closed,Please tag versions in git repository ,[],"It is very useful to tag releases in git for example to:
- `git bissect` an issue
- knowing which code is being used for a given bug report
- build a stable version

Looking at `app/build.gradle` history, the following commands should do the appropriate tagging:

```
git tag 1.1.0 0f61a73abc5ac928cb6d318f12eef319db718255
git tag 1.0.0 57340b42f12a31d2392a199a4f7f6ea7e6e634ce
git tag 0.1.0 4aebb4d0bc9cd7b407799e620938031e0df29aa8
git push --tags

Bonus points if you have a GPG key, this way you can sign them with `git tag --sign` :-D
