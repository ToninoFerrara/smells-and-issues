veken0m/bitcoinium,open,Feature request: Mini widget,[],"Hi,

Love the app, thank you for your hard work.

One thing I really hope you could implement are mini widgets.
Something like this:

Exchange name, Currency, Value

ex.:

BTC-e BTC/USD 624.25
MtGox BTC/USD 133.69
BTC-e LTC/USD 16.40

All this could fit in the space of a single current widget.

Most of the time I don't really need all the other info, the widgets are just cluttering my android launcher. Maybe you could use some color codes to show if the last price change went up, stuff like that but keep it all very tiny for those of us our are ""screen realestate"" challenged :P

Thanks again, your app helps me sleep at night.

Fred.

update: I just tought of something, when ""touching"" a widget instead of just opening the bitcoinium settings, it would be nice if it opened a screen with extra info on the currency itself, on this page you could display all the info that couldnt fit in the tiny widget and maybe links to charts etc... and allow to drill down into more info on specific currencies. This would also be nice with the regular widgets.  Then you could put an icon on the top to access the settings page.

Just my thoughts, Thanks again.

"
veken0m/bitcoinium,open,Improve Chart-Generation,[],"Hi,

just a hint: there is an easier and faster way to generate the charts for exchanges:

you can use the json access to bitcoincharts.com which accepts the following parameter:
http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/chart.json?m=mtgoxUSD&r=1

m= exchange
r= days in past

This api gives you a preordered and filtered array of values, which are sufficient to generate a chart. As those are only a low number of values, the performance should increase dramatically ;)
