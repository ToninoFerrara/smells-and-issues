**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In #145 a hardware address vendor search was added, which I highly appreciate.

However, as already stated in one of the comments, the search is case sensitive, it only works if you type upper case letters. That breaks user expectations and is cumbersome to type with some keyboards.

I consider that a bug, because lower case letters are perfectly valid for a hexadecimal value.

I could imagine someone saying CPU usage would be an issue. If so, perhaps there's a way to block while waiting for the WiFi hardware to have fresh data.

Another possible objection would be that graphs would scroll too fast. A good solution would be to switch to a graph that uses logarithmic time for the x-axis. Recent changes would take up the most space, with older samples essentially getting averaged together so they take up less."

VREMSoftwareDevelopment/WifiAnalyzer,closed,Weird name of file when saved/exported  to file,[],"### Expected behaviour
When I save to a file on my android device, I expect a name like **WifiAnalyzer-2018-02-04T14:54:54.log** i.e the file should be named after the app and a timestamp.

### Actual behaviour
I don't know if it's a bug on my phone (or Solid Explorer) but I ended up with a file named `Time Stamp|SSID|BSSID|Strength|Primary.txt` i.e like the first line of the file.

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
Choose Export in the hamburger menu and choose to export to a file (here I choose to use Solid Explorer) and save it to a file

### Please provide a screenshot of the issue you are reporting
Not needed here. I explained it above

The service https://www.mylnikov.org/archives/1170 proposes unlimited access to Wi-Fi location.
Also service could triangulate final position of a device due to multiple APs inside of the scan result.

As an example the link `https://api.mylnikov.org/geolocation/wifi?v=1.2&bssid=00:0C:42:1F:65:E9` could be used.
The visualization map could be found here `http://find-wifi.mylnikov.org/#00:0C:42:1F:65:E9`.

VREMSoftwareDevelopment/WifiAnalyzer,closed,Enhancement - Use modern Android APIs,[],"Hi guys

Your wonderful app has a little downside: still targets Lollipop APIs. Is there any particular reason for this?

Targeting Marshmallow and above would introduce many advantages like: backup of user settings, proper multi-window support, user (runtime) permissions, Quick Settings Tiles, App shortcuts and so on.

Many apps have moved forward newer APIs, it's a shame this wonderful app is being left behind!"
VREMSoftwareDevelopment/WifiAnalyzer,closed,Fix duplicate elimination in language selection,[],"Instead of using the Locale.getCountry() string as the stored preference
for the user's language selection, we should probably use
Locale.toString(). For example, this would means storing de_DE instead
of DE.

Otherwise, if the system Locale has the same country as a translation,
but a different language (something like en_DE), the actual German
translation (de_DE) is not shown in the preference list as it is
identified as a duplicate by the comparator used by
LanguagePreference.getData().

Fix it by replacing .getCountry() with .toString() at the relevant
places."

This change adds another option in the SettingActivity which allows
the user to select a language. Currently, this is only a proof of
concept and is only implemented for German and English, as I didn't
find a way to automatically determine all available translations yet
(i.e. all languages for which values-XX exists) - if anyone knows
how to do that in a generic way, please let me know and I'll
implement this.

first attempt at playing around with Android apps."

In the current implementation it could switch between 2.4 and 5 GHz but in the future if or when #48 is implemented it could enable/disable the frequencies separately.

If this was implemented the old settings option could be dropped because it is redundant.

VREMSoftwareDevelopment/WifiAnalyzer,closed,Remove Guest Access Points from Channel Rating,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi guys.

Thanks for this great open-source tool. :-)

I think the channel rating tool may have a small quirk (or maybe I don't fully understand it?):

I fortunately operate the only AP on the 5 GHz band in range. I've set my OpenWrt router to spawn two SSIDs on the same radio, one which is my ""main"" SSID, then a guest SSID. Both SSIDs are obviously on the same channel, as they are provided by the same radio.

In this case WiFiAnalyzer should not recommend me to move to a different channel, as it should detect it's the same AP (same channel, same BSSID). But it seems to do so, as it always indicates the channel my AP is set to as ""average"" (yellow) or even ""bad"" (red), and shows ""Best Channels: <all the channels I'm not using>"".

Is that a corner-case you didn't consider?

Kind regards,

Ralf
