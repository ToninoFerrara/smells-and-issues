loadrunner/Facebook-Contact-Sync,closed,Feature request: Actually replace the Google contact pictures,[],"Hi,

instead of adding the UberSync accounts to the Google contacts accounts, it would be really nice to have the option to actually replace the Google contacts profile pictures, so that they also appear on other devices and the Google contacts web view.

Maybe someone with more programming skills than myself would like to implement that? ;)

Thanks!

loadrunner/Facebook-Contact-Sync,closed,[Feature Request] Custom field for Facebook ID,[],"I was wondering what will happen once I need to factory reset my Atrix for updating the ROM and thought about the contact merging. I already did this to most of my contacts and it'd be a pain to merge/join them all again.

Reading about the subject, I found out that HTC stock Sense app handles this by adding some additional metadata to each contact you merge. These metadata are used to merge them back, if you need to format. [1]

Looking at the Google contacts interface (inside Gmail) I noticed that it's possible to create custom named fields. So, I ask: What you think about creating a custom field (""facebookID"", for example) and storing the merged contact id in it? This way, it would be possible to merge everyone back, even after a factory reset.

I'm not aware of anything like this in Facebook Contact Sync and I apologize if there is.

I'm not experienced in Android development, but I'm pretty good with Java. So, if you can guide me through the ""shortcuts"" of your code, I could help implementing this feature.

At last but not least, thank you for all your effort in developing and maintaining this great app.
