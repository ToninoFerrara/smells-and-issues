jecelyin/920-Text-Editor,closed,"from terminal, how to launch to edit file?",[],"This may not be the right place to ask this, but I've been stumped for days and am in desperate need of help with this issue.

I would like to know how to launch the editor from terminal emulator (I need this for a script that I'm working on).

As an example, how would I open /storage/emulated/0/Download/test.txt for editing?

When I try this: 
am start -a android.intent.action.EDIT -n com.jecelyin.editor/.JecEditor -d /storage/emulated/0/Download/test.txt

I get an error that includes ""Permission Denial: startActivity asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL""

I'm not sure exactly what that's about, so I try to work around it with this: 
am start --user 0 -a android.intent.action.EDIT -n com.jecelyin.editor/.JecEditor -d /storage/emulated/0/Download/test.txt

Now the editor starts, but it opens a new file and not the specified file. I've also tried different test files to exclude the possibility that test.txt is corrupt.

I'm stuck. Please help!

jecelyin/920-Text-Editor,open,Force-Closing at Launch on several builds of LolliPop (CM.12) on LG-(G3)-D850 AT&T.Lte,[],"I will try to remember to grab some logs, and more details of the system soon.  

NOTES:  
I really like this app, and it has been my 'go-to' text app on Android for several years now.

I am willing to try to repair the problem, but I am new to both Java and to native Android apps.  I have experience debugging C#, HTML5, and other typical web languages.

It would be helpful if someone is willing to give me some hints.  I'll do all the work, gather detailed info along the way, post it, but would likely need frequent tips/guidance.  If that is acceptable, please let me know via email: Paul@PaulJRichardson.com or sms/text: 909-486-3463

As a last resort?, the only remaining option I can think of would be for me to try and start a 'bounty' pool of funds for some dev-for-hire who will help out, perhaps at XDA or some other social-funding site?

Paul

```
// both zeros are highlighted, neither should be
1 / 0;
0 / 1;

// highlights the x's and colon
a = x > 5 ? 5 / x : x / 5

// highlights all the way to the end of the file or until another '/' is found

jecelyin/920-Text-Editor,open,Can't save after reloading some files,[],"If we have more than one opened tab, when we close 920 text-editor, and re-open it after, the tabs reopen correctly if we checked the option to.

But when we edit the files, the title tab won't highlight in red and if we hit the save button it won't save anything.

If we switch to another tab and then switch back to the original tab, then the tabs of the edited files will turn in red, but it won't be possible again to save (if we exit the editor it won't save anything either, nor warn about possible data loss).

The current workaround is to either reload the files, or simply hit the ""load"" button, then exit the select file dialog: the expected behavior will come back and it will be possible to save the files again.

I experienced this bug on a nexus 4 running cyanogen mod (android 4.2.2), and a nexus 7 running vanilla google android (4.2.2 as well)
