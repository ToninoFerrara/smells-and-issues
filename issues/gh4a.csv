Bonus: automatically scroll back to the place the page was before the refresh, like Chrome does."

#### Expected behavior
While sorting the repositories by newest-oldest, most commented -least commented, the app should be able to show the repositories accordingly. 

#### Actual behavior 
I opened the sort order option and clicked on most commented repositories and got the results as the repositories that had most comments were displayed first. 
But when I sorted the repositories by least commented, no change occurred as the repositories with highest comments were again shown at the top. 

I tried with all the available sort orders but the same thing happened again and again. 

#### How to reproduce
- Open octodroid github client and click on My issues
- On the right top corner  you will see a sort option, click on that
- Sort the repositories by newest first and then the oldest 
- You wont see any change when you switch from newest to oldest.

It should be able to load profiles conveniently, regardless of where it was clicked from... 


***Actual Behavior***

When a user profile is clicked from the weekly/monthly trending repos, it would load for like a second and then display  a message saying : Loading the data from Github failed 

But when a profile is clicked theory 'Today's' menu, it will work fine 

***How to reproduce the bug***

Open the app, login using your github details, open the menu at the top left corner, scroll down and select 'Trending Repos', now move to either the week or the month to see the trending repos. When it opens, select a repository, after loading, now touch the user's profile name located in the repository(before the '/'****** 
For instance, 
 *proflink/Gn4qr* Where proflink is the profile link we should click so as to get to the users profile to see more of his/her works and details )

After clicking on the link, it would load and after some couple of sec, it would give a message that loading data from github failed... 

***NOTE :***  when a profile is clicked from the 'today' list in the trending repo, it opens neatly 

To reproduce the bug might get a little tricky....  Just follow the step above and also endeavor to see the video below....

Thanks for your great work!
When selecting date for milestones using DatePicker, the app crashes on Galaxy Note 4 (Chinese system).
I found the following Stack Overflow discussions indicating that it is a problem of built-in DatePicker on some Samsung Lollipop devices:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28618405/datepicker-crashes-on-my-device-when-clicked-with-personal-app/31855744
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28345413/datepicker-crash-in-samsung-with-android-5-0

One solution seems to be changing the theme of the DatePicker.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Detach feature,[],"This is another approach to a feature implemented in #715.

# Behavior

![detach-task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5156340/31958191-3e4bc432-b8f1-11e7-8f26-f01840b18940.gif)

- When the app takes the full screen the new task also takes full screen and is brought to the front.
- When the app is in split-screen then the detached task will appear in the second split.

# Further improvements

- [ ] Decide which screens should include this detach button
  - [x] Issue
  - [x] Pull request
  - [x] File view
  - [x] Diff view
  - [ ] Repository
  - [x] User
  - [x] Commit
  - [ ] More?

- [ ] Possibly remove the back button from the toolbar for the detached task?
I'm not sure about this as it removes the possibility to navigate up through the hierarchy in the new task. But it would make it clear that this specific task is supposed to represent a single issue. With it, we could also update the title for the entry in the recent tasks list to mention number/name of the issue instead of generic ""OctoDroid"".

Get a ton of notifications for some high-activity repos (e.g. https://i.imgur.com/NYtdbUr.jpg) and being able to fold a repo's notifications will make it easier to navigate around this screen.

Also, another request is to implement some sort of lazy loading mechanism for notifications to avoid loading all at once (I watch a lot of repos, so I easily get 200+ notifications on most days and until I clear them, the notifications screen can take a lot of time to load). Maybe similar to the way GitHub handles large diffs with an explicit button/option to load the notifications for a given repo (e.g. https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/datasets/commit/e6fdd73f6a54a626a970ff29b23acce8720d7515) or even the way they're handled on GitHub web with a ""{x} more notifications for {repo}"" button that sends you to a dedicated notifications page for that repo."

However, I like having the comment box pinned to the bottom, so I can easily refer back to an earlier comment while I'm writing my own. Therefore, I suggest the following:

- Comment box is not visible when issue/pr is opened
- Add a FAB to these activities with a compose icon on it. When pressed, it expands into the current bottom sheet (probably using one of the libraries mentioned in #706). The text field should be focused at this point.
- As long as there is text in the comment box, it behaves just like the current one.
- When there is no text in the comment box, if the user interacts with any other element of the page, or presses the hardware back button, the box should collapse back into the fab.

This effect becomes more pronounced as one types more text in the box, until its height maxes out.

Due to this behavior, dropping out of the (almost-)full-screen compose view momentarily to refer to a previous comment is not always a viable strategy for participating in issue/PR conversations on the go.

These can be fixed as we find them, and also they're acceptable since the people running debug versions know to expect that.

So far I have not done much testing, but I have started using this locally and it seems to work fine. The only duplicate intent filter I found so far is opening `gh4a://` links during github authorization. I don't have time to fix that right now, but I think this is ok to merge even so (or you can do it).

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Improved filter visibility,[],"Currently, when you enable any of the issue filters such as by labels or milestones there is no visual indicator that this filtering is in effect. I decided to fix this by adding subtitles to filter entries in right drawer and a ""remove filter"" button in the main toolbar. This solves few problems at once:

- Remove filter button gives a visual cue to the user that there is a filter in effect
- It also allows them to quickly return to default state
- Details in right drawer menu provide information about how exactly the filters are set up which makes it easier to see why some issues aren't appearing

Right now this is just a proof of concept implementation and it only includes milestones. I would like to hear what you think about this.

It relies on small hack: To allow menu items have subtitles I've overridden default `design_navigation_menu_item.xml` layout. An alternative solution would be to not use menu resources in the right drawer and implement custom RecyclerView.

- There is a setting to toggle them, which I have set to be disabled by default
- There is a setting to change synchronization interval ranging from 15min (lowest possible value) to 6 hours (can add higher values)
- Clicking on notification opens its corresponding screen and automatically dismisses it from notification drawer
- All notifications belong to a single channel on Android O so users can customize here a priority, sound, vibration, etc.

Potential improvements:
- Auto-mark as read when clicking on notifications (could be controlled by setting)
- Button to manually mark as read (unsubscribe?)
- Include launcher badges (I plan to create a separate pull request for that once this one is merged)
- Better icon. I've used the launcher icon but it would be nice if someone could create a vector drawable with a similar shape. @slapperwan perhaps you still have contact with the guy that made the launcher icon (Would be also nice to create adaptive icon)
- Display icon of repository owner on each notification. (@maniac103 I'm not sure myself how to make it work well. We need something to load a Bitmap and the loading must finish before Job finishes.)

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Repository fragment rx refactor,[],"Newly **introduced** : 
- `rxJava2`

- `FillReadmeTask`

`FillReadmeTask` has been replaced by asynchronous operation concatenation from `flatMap` operator (`rxJava2`) while `ReadmeLoader` has been removed in favour of `RepositoryService`. 

The newly created `service` package is meant to gather `Service` classes, each one wrapping `data loading logic` that is currently contained into `Loaders`. This would have the advantage of reducing the number of `Loader` and `AsyncTask` classes used, plus it would `group` asynchronous data fetch processes by `Fragment`, instead of by `Data`. 

This would make the program logic easier to follow in my opinion, since `background services` populating the `view` would be all declared in one `Service` class, instead of multiple `Loader` and `AsyncTask` classes."

I seldom want to go look through the list of what I'm watching, unless I want to change that list -- in the context of notifications, and this mirrors the github interface, so we don't need to make people re-learn where it is.

Since we use Oauth since 4.1, we're now subject to those restrictions, which means that by default we don't have write access to organizations.
We need to deal with that in some way or another:

- We could tell the user about those restrictions at login time, but it's not too unlikely he forgot about them when he actually hits them.
- We could add wording pointing to the [approval request page](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps/) to e.g. the comment creation failure snackbar, but the user could have missed stuff (e.g. private repositories) at that point already
- We could offer basic authentication as alternative means for login, just as FastHub does. This feels like a workaround to me, though.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an API for querying whether one's own app (here: Octodroid) is subject to those restrictions, otherwise the solution would have been easy.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Add basic CircleCI config,[],"This is just a suggestion. Feel free to reject this PR if it's not to your liking :slightly_smiling_face: 

CircleCI can automate the task of building APKs directly from GitHub.
It builds an APK file using `./gradlew assembleFossDebug`, and uploads it as an artifact, 
making it available for download from the build page, under the Artifacts tab, [like so](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10238474/29023809-e77687de-7b77-11e7-8198-14eb399316b9.png).

### Setup process
The following are the required steps to set it up for this repository, **after merging this PR**:
(I think only @slapperwan can do this, as the repo owner)
- Create an account on https://circleci.com/signup/ and authorize GitHub.
- In the CircleCI app (https://circleci.com/dashboard) click on Projects on the left,
   click ""Add project"" on the top right.
- ""gh4a"" => Setup project
- Under ""Next steps"" click ""Start building""
   (Everything is set up by this PR)
- Navigate to the project settings (look for a gear icon),
  under ""Build settings"" click ""Environment Variables"".
  Here you need to add two variables (**case-sensitive**): ([it should look like this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10238474/29627757-d09ce640-883b-11e7-8b71-a9aabc9bdd12.png))
  1. `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_ClientId` with the value equal to the OAuth application's client ID,
      **wrapped in double-quotes (`""`)**.
  2. `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_ClientSecret` with the value equal to the OAuth application's client secret,
      **wrapped in double-quotes (`""`)**.
  - **Make sure** the **values** are wrapped in double-quotes (e.g. `""123456789abcdef""`), or the build will fail and **expose the client id and client secret publicly**.
- Done. Push something to master to trigger the build.
**Note:** Branches without this config file will fail to build.

Extra:
You can also add a badge to README.md, like:
![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/RedSparr0w/node-csgo-parser/tree/master.svg?style=svg) (example)
```md
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/slapperwan/gh4a/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/slapperwan/gh4a/tree/master)
```
or 
![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/RedSparr0w/node-csgo-parser/tree/master.svg?style=shield) (example)
```md
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/slapperwan/gh4a/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/slapperwan/gh4a/tree/master)
```


<!--
I should note that any changes regarding the ""gradle.properties"" file should be performed with care.
If the ""config parser"" fails to parse the file, it might expose the **client id and client secret**.
If you care about that (and I assume you do), make sure the following line in the `.yml` is always updated, and the actual command generates a proper ""gradle.properties"" file when run locally.
```yml
command: echo -e 'ClientId=""'$CLIENT_ID'""\nClientSecret=""'$CLIENT_SECRET'""' > gradle.properties
```

# Tasks

## :white_check_mark: Step 1 - Behavior

### :white_check_mark: Review Comments screen
- [x] ~~Redirect to correct commit or pull request changes when clicking on diff hunk file~~
  - Apparently, to display diffs for outdated comments we need to load multiple commits and combine the output. This means that support for this is not something for this pull request. The current solution is just to disable clicking on outdated files.
- [x] ~~Figure out how many diff lines to display~~
  - I don't really see a way how to determine this. 4 lines work nicely for now
- [x] ~~Figure out when to display hunk header in diffs (@@ line)~~
  - These are displayed when they are located directly above the first visible line. For now, I'm just going to not display them at all.
- [x] Add option to enter file with selected comment highlighted
- [x] Fix sorting issues
  - Most probably the sort order is first by filename, then by line number.
- [x] Toolbar actions
  - [x] Share
  - [x] Open in browser
- [x] Make line numbers clickable for sharing
- [x] Replying
  - [x] Figure out when to disable reply buttons (They are not always available)
    - If review comment is a reply to someone else's comment and was submitted together with other comments then it's displayed without reply button. Right now the app doesn't display it at all so I'll have to fix that. It's a bit confusing but better let's stay consistent :)
  - [x] Add replying dialog
  - [x] Refresh review after replying
- [x] Comment actions
  - [x] Edit
  - [x] Delete

### :white_check_mark: Reviews

- [x] Add indicator showing that all comments in review are outdated
- [x] Correctly load pending reviews and their comments
- [x] Add options menu
  - [x] ~~Edit (if has body text)~~
    - Couldn't find a way to edit reviews with API
  - [x] Share
- [x] ~~Add view changes button (figure out how exactly it works)~~
  - Similar to viewing files for outdated comments this would require loading and combining diff from multiple commits.
- [x] Add quoting for reviews with body

### :white_check_mark: Link handling
- [x] Handle `#pullrequestreview-<id>` links
- [x] Handle `#discussion_r<id>` links
- [x] Handle `#discussion-diff-<id><line id>` links

## Step 2 - User Interface

### General
- [x] Test with dark theme

### Review Comments screen
- [x] Make text in diff hunks selectable
- [x] Improve appearance of file headers
- [x] Make outdated hunks indicator easier to distinguish
- [x] Add spacing/dividers between hunks?

## Reviews
- [x] Improve show details button, should it be so big?
- [x] Improve review details text (right now hard to see when if it's a body or summary)
- [x] Improve indicator for all outdated comments
- [x] Add correct review type icons (approved, requested changes, etc)

## Step 3 - Cleanup

- [x] Extract all strings

___

This is 1st pull request implementing reviews support. It's focused on displaying them and replying to comment. Next pull requests will deal with creating new reviews, requesting reviewers etc.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Repositories tabs,[],"A test implementation of repository tabs as suggested in https://github.com/slapperwan/gh4a/pull/578#issuecomment-301339782.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Line link sharing,[],"This is an incomplete change which adds line link sharing _only_ for diffs. It's built on top of the existing popup for comments.

Similar popup could be implemented for non-diff files. I didn't do it here as it needs some javascript code to make lines clickable and I'm not really sure what's a nice way to do this. Alternatively, for these files only line numbers could be clickable but similarly, I have no ideas how to add that...

Might need some additional testing (especially the database scheme update code) but it already works nicely.

As you can see in the gif I also changed how bookmark removing works. Now you swipe items right/left to remove them instantly. And you get an option to undo that action via the displayed snackbar.

I'm not sure about the reordering code. Perhaps there is an easier way to make it work? Right now if you quickly drag up or down the reorder code can skip some items and instead of shifting them all up/down it replaces dragged item with the last item.

Bonus improvement is a click highlight which was missing :)

slapperwan/gh4a,open,Release beta versions to Play Store,[],"May I suggest you consider publishing beta / dev versions to Play Store?

The open beta feature will allow you to publish beta versions of the app,
and users to install them, test out new features, and maybe help you out by reporting bugs **before** a new version goes live.

You can add something to help users, and you (devs) differentiate between the dev versions, perhaps the commit hash (as the app's version will only change when a new version is released).
I mean, if that's not already somewhere in the code.

I know everyone can ""just"" build the app on their computer and then install it on their phones,
but I figured, since many other apps use this Play Store feature, why not suggest you do that too. :wink: 

You could also, potentially set up a CI service (integration) to auto-publish beta versions, but it may be a bit more complicated than that, since I reckon you wouldn't want it to publish a new beta version for every single commit that's pushed to the master branch.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,"Incorrect ""Reopen"" button on PR",[],"I searched for a bit but couldn't find an issue about this.


I opened a pull request on a repo to which I have write access,
the pull request is from a branch on the repo (not a fork) to the develop branch (not the default branch).

The image on the top shows that I have a button to reopen the PR, even though it is still open and unmerged, as you can see from the green color.
The image on the bottom shows the options I have when I click the three dots -
I have the ""Close"" option.
It seems like it shouldn't be this way.
Instead, it should **only show** ""Reopen"" when the PR was **closed unmerged**.

Link to PR: `https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage/pull/3588`

P.S.
**The organization has not yet allowed the OctoDroid OAuth2 application [(full) access to the information](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10238474/25366770/8749e9d6-297a-11e7-84d9-5289e0432a80.png)**,
so maybe that has something to do with this behavior?

- [x] the egit github api jar: maybe merge the library into the main project? If you're not planning to send your patches upstream, this will be easier for you too.

Every time I went into that pull request and scrolled to that comment,
the app freezed just before the comment, then crashed.

I had a hunch that it was that tag that caused it, because it looked kinda ""funky"" on Github.
I was able to work around it by editing my comment to:
```
2.
>Quote

I hope this information describes the issue in the best possible way.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Add shortcuts to enter labels and milestone management screens,[],"This commits adds neutral buttons to the dialogs displayed in the issue edit activity when selecting labels or milestones. Pressing on these buttons opens corresponding screens and if something is modified by the user they notify the calling activities to reload the data.

To implement this change I had to make a small modification in the `IssueMilestoneEditActivity`. It now uses the `finish()` method after successfull actions instead of starting new issue list activity. This is the same behavior as the one used in `IssueEditActivity`. I made the necessary changes to make sure that the parent milestones list reloads its data if it was the one that opened the edit screen.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Incorrect text is displayed in the button present in the My issues activity  ,[],"**Summary:**

Incorrect text is displayed in the button present in the My issues activity. When we tap on the ""SHOW CLOSED"" button on the top right  in the toolbar, we get to see a new activity which displays closed issues. But the the text inside button doesn't change to ""SHOW OPEN"" in the closed issues activity. It doesn't make sense to display the text inside the button as ""SHOW CLOSED"", as the user would already be viewing closed issues. 

**Steps to reproduce:**

Step 1) Tap on the ""My issues"" in the navigation drawer.
Step 2) Tap on ""SHOW CLOSED"".

**Expected Behaviour:** 

The text inside the button should display ""SHOW OPEN"", as tapping on the button displays open issues.

**Observed Behaviour:**

The text inside the button displays ""SHOW CLOSED"" instead of displaying ""SHOW OPEN"".

Still thinking about this but I tink I have a basic implementation idea. I want it to look similar to the event cards in ""News Feed"" but since each notification is a different item I'll have to do it a bit differently.

1. When the notification in a holder is null then we'll render a header with repository name and a button to mark all notifications from that repo as read. It should also have standing out background and a top shadow to replicate the card look.

2. When the notification is not null then we'll render a notification. This will have a card background and some more notification specific stuff on it. Not sure exactly how I'll make this one look like.

3. When the notification is set to be the last one it'll also render the bottom shadow which will, in turn, look like all the notifications and header were located on a single card.

You can get a basic idea of how the grouping will work if you open the app and check the log.

I noticed OctoDroid behaves differently when opened from at least one other app: Play Store.

It would be great if this could be avoided. The simplest thing would be a confirmation, but only if some text had been entered.

Nicer would be, instead of a confirmation, if entered text could be stored somewhere within the app as a draft. If the user went back in to open a new issue, or enter a new comment, the draft content could automatically appear.

On the PR _Conversation_ view (a PR's home page), one can see all line comments that have been added, together with the corresponding line's diff content and its context (the preceding lines' content).  This line comment view includes a hyperlink, _View full changes_, that provides a quick way to jump to the corresponding changes in the corresponding file.

Please add similar functionality and UX to OctoDroid.

Currently (as of version 4.0.3), OctoDroid does show line comments in _Conversation_ view, but it's missing the other aspects.  There is (as far as I can tell) no way to reply to a line comment in that view.  The view doesn't show the line's diff content and surrounding context, so understanding a comment usually requires viewing the full changes.  However, there is also (as far as I can tell) no link to jump to the line comment in the context of the full changes, so doing that involves memorizing the file path and comment text, switching to the file view, choosing the file, and finding the line comment.  In a non-trivial PR, this is very unwieldy.

The line content is shown, together with context.  There is a button to _Add a line note_ and a link to _View full changes_.

I would suggest to enlarge the combine the area of the text and the downloads together, and make the whole scrollable.

i cannot view any kind of files in the app. (txt, pdf, sh, js, html, ..) it is loading all the time.
But i can open them with other applications (with the button at the top right).

Is this a very big bug or am i doing something wrong? I am new to this app because no other app
can show pdf files in the app itself or provide me with an ""open with"" dialog. thanks for that btw.

Currently I've reverted to 3.7.2, which is perfect for me, and disabled updates.
- **black**
  - `OPEN` status is immediately visible
  - header is small and unobtrusive

- **Material Dark**
  - `OPEN` status is practically lost
  - header is huge, bright and dominating
  - header labels are wrapped in a broken way
  - subject (title) isn't the most readable thing in the header, so it looks unstructured
  - avatar is tinted
  - overall: appearance is prioritized, content is subdued, which isn't what Material Design is about, actually.

### Comments Icon on Issue List
- As the GitHub behaviour and design, it should be cleaner to show a comment count only when there is one comment at least.
- Please use [Holo Stock icons](https://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html#action-bar-icon-pack), or another vector and less intrusive icon, to avoid ""pixelation"" and incoherence.

If I use the hardware keyboard to type into OctoDroid, for example when entering a new issue, or a comment on an issue, I can use the standard of Menu+X to cut, Menu+C to copy and Menu+V to paste, that is, you use the Menu button like a Ctrl key on a desktop computer. These functions work fine in themselves.

However, after performing one of these actions, the text box acts as if Menu is still being held down, even though it's not. So for example, if I press V (on its own), the clipboard will be pasted again. Even worse, if I press A (on its own), the entire contents of the textbox will be selected (i.e. Select All), and if I don't notice and press another key immediately afterwards, the entire textbox is wiped and replaced with the next key, with no way to undo.

I don't get this problem in any other app.

As a workaround, after using Menu+C or whatever, if I slide the keyboard closed then open again, something gets reset such that the textbox no longer acts as if Menu is pressed. But it is hard to remember to do that.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,Relative Times Wrong in Some Places (by UTC - TimeZone),[],"I became suspicious when OctoDroid regularly showed commit times as ""x hours from now"". I thought only @homakov had that ability. :smiling_imp: 

The OctoDroid app correctly displays times in its news feed. However, when clicking on a news feed item of the form ""#{dev} pushed to #{branch} at #{user}/#{repo}"", a commit with an invalid time is displayed. The first line below the menu has the name of the committer and a relative time. This relative time does not match the time shown in the news feed. It is also wrong based on looking at GitHub in a browser. In all cases I have observed, it is off by 6 or 7 hours. I have a suspicion that this is based on the difference between UTC and US Central Time (6 hrs), plus round off from relative time formatting to the nearest hour (+0/+1 hr).

The relative time error is also visible on another screen. By long pressing on a news feed item, selecting the option of the form ""Repo #{user}/#{repo}"", and then selecting or side scrolling to 'Commits' list, you will see a list of commits. All times in this list of commits are wrong and are the same as the times shown in the commits themselves.

Please let me know if you need additional information to reproduce the error.

The 'Clone' menu option launches the `org.openintents.git.clone.PREPARE` intent which will give the user a chance to review the details of the checkout (target dir, bare/not-bare, etc) before starting the clone proper. The menu option is hidden if no app can be found to handle the intent (e.g. if Agit isn't installed).

We have to pass the source-uri for doing the clone, but the GitHub api doesn't provide the clone url - only the project url, so we work it out from that, using an ssh url if the repo is private.

I have to apologise but unfortunately I wasn't able to get Gh4a to compile in the time I had available (I couldn't find the mygson dependency for https://github.com/slapperwan/github-java-sdk ) so I've been coding blind to some extent, but I've already tested very similar code against Hubroid, so I think it should work just fine - please let me know if there are any problems!

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,landscape layout,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","there is a problem with gh4a that involves using it in landscape mode (desire z, 800x480) - while trying to create an issue (and maybe perform some other actions) it is impossible to reach the submit (i.e. 'create issue') button.
this is because user is not able to scroll the view down and almost whole view is taken by input box - rest is used by system bar and gh4a two infobars. there is also no menu available to aid this situation.

slapperwan/gh4a,closed,wrong encoding,[],"i'd like to report that gh4a uses wrong encoding, at least while browsing gists. you can check my public gist 889785 for a sample.
there is also a similar case while displaying feed, but i've found that this is also errorneus on githab webpage, so i'm not (yet) counting it as a bug in gh4a.
