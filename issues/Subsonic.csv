I've tried this on very quiet and very loud tracks and it's very clear that ReplayGain isn't being applied.

I've loaded the Opus files from my phone into foobar2000, confirming that the ReplayGain values are there, so it's just that DSub is ignoring/isn't reading them.

I'm running dsub on a pixel and after upgrading Android to 9.0 there are temperamental issues with displaying metadata and also remote control. I'm noticing that sometimes there is no metadata displayed at all and this is when the remote controls stop working as well. Others are having problems with other media players but any solutions I've come across haven't worked.

However, most of the time the remote controls work and I do get *some* metadata. What I've seen is that when starting a new album/playlist the metadata appears instantly with the correct information, but once the next track starts or if you skip a track, the actual track name populates in both the track name and artist name fields, and the album name is empty. It also takes 3-4 seconds for the information to be updated. So it works but it doesn't work -

I've tested Google Play Music and Spotify but both are working correctly, so I'm hoping there's a solution to this. I've had a peek at Spotify in Jadx but the obfuscated names are a bit too hard to sift through.

I have tried a few things with the code to narrow down the problem:

* Compiling against API 28

This seemed to be fairly easy. Apart from a few changes to the gradle files (adding flavorDimensions and settings buildTypes in ServerProxy) and proguard.cfg (adding a dontwarn line) the only thing that stopped the app from working is lack of HTTPS which is worked around by adding `android:usesCleartextTraffic=""true"">` in the Application tag in the manifest. I can make a PR if you want. No improvement though.

* Upgrading the deprecated MediaSession etc. in Util and RemoteControlClientLP to their 'Compat' versions.

This didn't seem to do anything either.

* Playing with the broadcastNewTrackInfo and broadcastPlaybackStatusChange methods in Util

Commenting out `context.sendBroadcast(avrcpIntent)` doesn't seem to affect anything... I found these [changes](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_packages_apps_music/commit/f02d3c605f5d1d091ca7e27170010ad23cd22134#diff-29edfb2901ba2915d7e6f9c2d9e4ad9d) in com.android.music that might have now made their way into Pie, if so that could explain the change in behavior.

When clicking on the menu item to start the download of the files of the current album, the download starts but sometimes a file will not finish downloading. Instead it moves on to the next file. Also sometimes a file will finish downloading, the green icon appears, the cue moves to the next file but then the green icon from the previously downloaded file disappears after a few seconds.
Checking the file system at this point shows that the file is really not there.

The app will then restart the download of this file (this can happen with  multiple files per download cue) at a later point, sometimes failing many times per file before finally succeeding.

I also noticed that with this automatic retrying it happens that the app is sometimes trying to download more than one file at the same time. This never happened before the update. All this makes it take a really long time to download a complete album. I think there have also been instances where an album was not completely downloaded at all, but I am not totally sure.

Yesterday I noticed something else that may be related:
I browsed an album that been permanently cached a long time ago. When viewing the track list the green icons were visible for all songs.
But then after 2 or 3 seconds the green icons all disappeared. The app had just deleted the whole album without me telling it to do so.

After successful syncing music from airsonic to android using dsub some music-filenames in the playlists text files (m3u files - located in playlists folder of dsub) contain the text "".complete."" in their filenames.

Example (replaced artist and album with ...)
/storage/85C8-1DEB/Android/media/github.daneren2005.dsub/music/.../.../11-title.mp3
/storage/85C8-1DEB/Android/media/github.daneren2005.dsub/music/.../..../01-title.complete.mp3

Why is this an issue?
In general everything works as long as one does NOT want to freely chose the android music player to use. As far as I know in android the folders are scanned for playlists and music somewhere central. Then other apps use the scanned data. The central scan fails (result is an empty playlist in stock music app) when the files mentioned in the playlist file do not exist. It also fails if the file exists, but the filename or path in the playlist is wrong. (Contains "".complete."" for example while file name does not)

I would like to be able to use any android music player, not just dsub. For that android has to be able to recognise the files of playlists. Dsub is very close to this. It works for all playlists that do not contain the "".complete."" part in filenames.

This does NOT happen in EVERY playlist.

So the only way I am able to select an artist is to open my phone, go into Dsub (outside of Android Auto), and queue up the artist, album, or song, and THEN DSub within Android Auto will play what I selected.

Though I have one small issue when Dsub preloads upcoming tracks at full bandwidth it causes the currently playing track to stutter slightly here and there. 

If I use a vpn, or if t-mobile throttles my connection or if I shut off the connection there is no stuttering. Basically anything that reduces bandwidth enough so Dsub can read/play tracks.

It seems that when using full bandwidth from my t-mobile connection it exceeds some limit of either the head unit or the sd card. 

It would be great if I could find a way to prevent this from happening and keep it simple so I can just get in the car and drive without having to fuss with dsub to get it working. If anyone has any ideas how to fix this, I'd be grateful!

Edit: If I use the head units internal storage, I don't experience this issue. However when I use a class 10 UHS 3 microsd I do have the issue..

This works quite well on Ampache so far.

Now I want all tracks in this list to be automatically synchronized with Android. All tracks of the list should be downloaded to Android for offline use, so that they can be played without an internet connection. This sync should only run if there is a connection via Wifi. The sync should start automatically as soon as there is a connection via Wifi. If all tracks are available offline, the sync should be terminated. The time stamp, when a song was last played in offline mode, should be transferred to Ampache during sync.

Thank you for all the hard work that went into creating this fantastic application.

I am an avid audiobook listener and recently switched from a standalone solution to airsonic + DSub.
One common scenario for me is to listen to audiobooks while falling asleep. With my old setup I would resume any book (most are multi-track, some are single track), create a bookmark shortly before falling asleep (so I can start off from the same spot with a clear head the next day, etc.), set the sleep timer and zonk out.

While DSubs automatic bookmarking logic works great during normal playback, it fails me in the above scenario. Apparently DSub creates a new bookmark once the timer stops playback and deletes/overwrites my manual bookmark.
Is this expected behavior or is there a bug / wrong expectation on my end? Can I read up on the internal logic of the automatic bookmarking somewhere?

Is there a way to set persistent / protected manual bookmarks? E.g. sometimes I want to bookmark a particular interesting part for later re-listening. With the current bookmark logic this bookmark might be overwritten / deleted during regular playback, if I pause/stop within the same track again.

The downside is that anyone who finds out about my ""secret"" URL gets access to my subsonic server (well, a username/password prompt of subsonic anyways).

I've decided to increase the security of this setup by configuring NGINX to listen on a separate port and use a self-signed (private CA, created using easyRSA) cert to do the forwarding. NGINX is configured to reject all connections on this port where the incoming cert's signature does not match my private CA signature. The android device has all the required certs installed (cert+key, CA cert), and the CA cert is marked as ""trusted"". I can open connections to Subsonic this way using the browser in the phone without any problems, but the app fails.

Upon closer inspection and a few tests, it appears that the app is unable to send the correct cert for the domain in question, and NGINX rejects the request as expected.

Is there a way to select the correct cert? Maybe even some basic matching using the cert's CN vs the domain would suffice.

1)  Play an album in your collection

3)  Navigate to a different album in your collection and press 'play'

New album will not play.  Dsub client will be stuck showing 'buffering'.  A workaround is to disconnect from the Chromecast and reconnect.  

Notes about what I've tried and my environment:
1)  I have tried turning caching while casting on and off, as well as gapless playback
2)  I have tried multiple devices with multiple versions of android
3)  I have tried all versions of the dsub client back to 5.3.1
4)  My home contains multiple chromecasts, including a group of two for playback on multiple floors
5)  I happen to have a Plex server as well, and my Plex phone app can perform this operation successfully to the same Chromecast

daneren2005/Subsonic,open,audio sent via bluetooth when first opening app crashing BT device,[],"This is admittedly an odd issue, and only occurs on one of my bluetooth car receivers with my android (LG V10) device.

I have a device called a GROM Audio USB3 car bluetooth adapter.  This device plays both bluetooth and USB audio files.  USB based audio plays automatically if a USB device is connected.  When I open any media player other than dsub, everything is fine and the USB audio keeps playing until I initiate playback in the media app.   There are no interruptions in USB playback until then.

When I open DSUB, USB playback is cut off as though music is being played through DSUB via bluetooth, but then immediately stops (1-2 seconds later) and the device returns to playing USB audio.  Now when I press play on DSUB or any other media player app, nothing plays through the BT device.  However, the phone is still ""sending"" audio through the bluetooth connection as though everything is fine.  My only recourse is to restart the BT device (disconnecting/turning off BT on the phone doesn't work).

Basically, DSUB is doing something at open that is hanging the BT device.  This doesn't happen with any other car based BT interface.  I have heard the immediately BT ""interruption"" when opening DSUB with other devices, but they seem to handle it better.

This doesn't happen with the subsonic app.  Is there maybe a setting causing the transmission at app open?

It's a very weird and isolated issue that makes it so I can't use dsub (which I love) in this particular car."

However, the previous/next buttons still rewind/fast forward even though they are using the previous/next icons and running the previous/next intents.

It turns out that there is a separate check for if it's an audiobook or podcast (rather, is not a song) in the actual previous/next DownloadService methods.  I would guess this was added in before the icon swapping was added, though I haven't checked that in the code.  Whether or not it's a long song is checked for in the IF block in Notifications.java lines 173-200.

A few minor other changes that aren't actually related to fixing the bug:
I rewrote an If/elif/else statement - this was mostly because I was having major trouble trying to follow how the flow of the statement went.  Mine is a few lines longer but easier to follow (for me, at least, but then, I wrote it...).

In 'Offline' mode (or browsing cached files) no such distinction is possible. This also applies to podcasts that when in online mode are kept separate but when offline/cached are mixed in with music and the rest. 

Looking at the cached files, Dsub keeps the folder structure of the original files but only below the 'media folder' level. E.g. in the designated Dsub 'cache' directory, 'Savage Love' (podcast) sits next to 'Souleye' (music) which sits next to a video folder.

My request is either to carry over the keep last X option to podcasts or add an option to not remove podcasts that are cached unless the user does it manually.  Any other ideas you may have that avoid this redownloading would be cool.

So is they're a way to build this app easier ? ( Think the build process is a bit to difficult for the fdroid build server i guess )
Any way to patch the build metadata file ? ( i'm absolutely not a pro in this domain ... )

This is because it was connecting to /subsonic/rest2/, when that doesn't exist on regular subsonic, so tomcat returned its 404 page, and the unmarshalling failed on that.

It's due to how Util.getRestUrl and ServerInfo.getServerInfo deals with cached values, I'd suggest the fix would be to try dropping the cached serverinfo value if test connection isn't working in this way.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Playback and caching (permanent and non-permanent) of files containing one or more slashes in artist tag,[],"I just noticed a problem when trying to play a file from my ampache server.
This file is part of the Treme Season 2 Soundtrack. It's actually the second track. The first one played fine, on the second one the playback fails and it skips to the third track.
The same phanomenon occured on some of the other tracks of this album.
I then tried to manually cache the files - that didn't work either.
Then I noticed that the artists name of the problematic tracks all contained slahes. They are used to separate multiple artists for one track. When I manually replaced the slashes with dots on one track and tried again playback was successful.
As this album was tagged using the MusicBrainz database I would guess that it should be ok to use slashes (I know they can be problematic when not correctly escaped) for any tag field.
I haven't tested if the problem also occurs when a slash is used in another tag field.
Is there some thing that can be done about this problem?

Thanks
Arno

EDIT:
I just verified that a slash in a track name tag is NOT a problem. When I view the file system I can see that the slash is replaced by a dash in the file name. Maybe a similar mechanism could be used for folder names as well.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Performance enhancement,[],"  We are working on a project called PersisDroid (http://www.cudroid.com/PersisDroid/) for detecting potential performance issues. Our tool could find performance degradation caused by improper usage of asynchronous executions.
  We find that in some cases your app may suffer a long processing delay.

  Case:
  **Related source code** Class: [CacheCleaner](https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic/blob/master/app/src/main/java/github/daneren2005/dsub/util/CacheCleaner.java) Method: [clean](https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic/blob/master/app/src/main/java/github/daneren2005/dsub/util/CacheCleaner.java#L42)
  **Circumstance** In our testing, we found it sometimes takes long for the BackgroundCleanup task to be queuing for executed. 
  **Problem** _execute_ method of AsyncTask is used for executing BackgroundCleanup task. This method executes multiple AsyncTasks in a default sequential queue. That means if two tasks are executed simultaneously, one task have to wait for another. Our testing suggest that the BackgroundCleanup task often conflicts with the task _WebViewClassic.setupPackageListener_ (for Android version 4.x).
  **Suggested modification** Use _executeOnExecutor_ instead of _execute_ method.

As a long time fan of Dsub, I recently upgraded from an HTC One XL to a new Samsung G5.  I seem to be having an issue with the music controls persisting on the lockscreen.  If I fire up DSub pick a playlist, begin playback and turn my screen off when I click the power button again the lock screen shows with the full screen music art and music controls as expected.

If I attempt to hit the 'prev/next' controls to skip to another song, the song changes but the music controls and the full screen art disappear and i see my normal lockscreen wallpaper.  Playback continues normally and at this point the only way I can switch songs is via the small controls in the notification pulldown or via DSub itself.

As an experiment I built a playlist of the cached songs Dsub had downloaded and tried playing it with Samsung's 'Music' app that came with the phone.  The lock screen music controls and full screen art behave normally and allow track skipping without the problems above.

This is a really annoying problem as I love Dsub and it's part of my daily commute to work.  Any tips or advice would be awesome.  Would be willing to try experimental APK's for a fix!

Thanks.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Kepp whole library in sync,[],"Hi,
I trie to use DSub to keep synchronized all my subsonic music files. I found that there is no specific option for this neither any way to do it manualy (e.g. a 'select all' option in any view, and 'synchronize selection' or something like that). And selecting 3000+ files manually is not an option.
I found a sort of workarround consisting of a script executed daily on my server that generates a playlist with all my music files, and the built-in daily playlist import of Subsonic. This way I can have an up to date playlist with all my music files. 
If I tell DSub to keep this playlist synchronized, then all my new music files are downloaded during the night. This works great. However DSub fails to synchronize deletions, which results in local files that have no more correspondences on the server. I know that the files removed from a synchronized playlist are supposed to be unpinned, but it appears to be not realy reliable, and it is not the behavior that I'm looking for as unpinned songs are not automatically deleted.
One could think of several ways to fix this. But maybe a 'garbage collector' for automatic deletion of 'orphin' files (with no more correspondences on the server) would be enough for me. Of course a specific option in the settings for keeping a whole media folder in sync would be ideal.

Thanks for the good work.

Also, after loading a new playlist, moving the sliders make no audible difference.  Then, if you were to uncheck then re-check the EQ box, the sliders remain ""grayed out"" and cannot be moved.  You would have to go back to the playlist screen, then return back to the EQ screen (where you will now see the EQ box unchecked).  Then re-enabling EQ will resume normal operation and moving sliders will once again work and audible differences can again be observed.

A more detailed steps to reproduce:
1.  Load an album
2.  Turn on EQ
3.  Boost a setting or settings that will give you an obvious change in tone.
4.  Go back to the playlist screen.
5.  Remove all.
6.  Re-load the same album (you can load any other album that you wish, but loading the same album will help you notice the audio differences much easier)
7.  Notice that the EQ checkbox is still ON.
8.  Go into the EQ screen and move the sliders.  Notice that moving the sliders make no audible changes.
9.  While still in the EQ screen, uncheck the Enabled box.  Then, while still in the EQ screen, check the Enabled box again.  Notice that the slider remain ""grayed out"" and you cannot move them.
10.  Return to the playlist screen.
11.  Go back to the EQ screen.  Notice the Enabled box is now unchecked again.
12.  Check the Enabled box.  You will now see the sliders light up and moving them will once again allow you to hear audible changes.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Inclusion into the F-Droid repository,[],"Good evening!

I've modified the DSub app so that it no longer depends on the Google Play services. This removes the support for the Chromecast.

The reason why anyone would do this is to include it in the F-Droid app repository. A collection of completely free and open source applications. For it to be included in this repository it cannot link to non-free libraries. Note that F-Droid has nothing against the Chromecast or communication with it; only against non-free software.

I'm wondering if you're interested in maintaining the noPlay branch in your repository or if I should maintain it in my fork: https://github.com/Rovanion/Subsonic/tree/noPlay
"
daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Reducing the git repository size,[],"Hi,
I recently cloned the repository for DSub and due to my, at the moment, limited bandwidth found that the repository size was quite big. It totalled no less than 125 MiB or 140MB of which a majority was git pack files. 

Locally I used BFG repository cleaner to clean out history for files larger than 500KB, which normally is only media files, which reduced the repository size down to 44MB, which is still large but ~100MB smaller. I would recommend considering shrinking the repository size as it makes the first encounter with your project quicker and more pleasant, though be careful not to go over board with the pruning. Below is the procedure I used with help of the BFG repo cleaner:

``` bash
cd dsub
wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.11.0/bfg-1.11.0.jar -O bfg.jar
java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 500K
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

Also: Considering the name of this repository I would guess that this repo started out as a bare clone of the whole subsonic SVN. As of such there are huge swaths of old code that has never held any relevance to the Android app that could be pruned from the history. If that is true the below folders could be purged from the repository history:

```
subsonic-assembly
subsonic-booter
subsonic-graphics
subsonic-installer-debian
subsonic-installer-mac
subsonic-installer-rpm
subsonic-installer-windows
subsonic-main
subsonic-tools
subsonic-transcode
supersonic-graphics
```

I tried out this theory on my local repository using the following for loop:

``` bash
for folder in subsonic-assembly subsonic-booter subsonic-graphics subsonic-installer-debian subsonic-installer-mac subsonic-installer-rpm subsonic-installer-windows subsonic-main subsonic-tools subsonic-transcode supersonic-graphics; do
  java -jar bfg.jar --delete-folders $folder ./;
  git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive; 
done
```

Note that when trying this on your own repo you will have to clone the repo into another folder in order to see the full effect of `git gc`:

``` bash
git clone one-folder-with-DSub the-new-folder-with-DSub-in-it
```

This reduced the repository size by yet another 10MB down to 34MB. With this information and your much better knowledge about the repository I'm sure you could recall yet more old subsonic paths that were in the original repository you cloned a long time ago that had and still has no relevance to the Android app.

Thank you for your time!

I see something to do with caching was changed in commit 73de838 (which the 4.8.5 release predates). Are there 'nightly' builds for DSub anywhere I can try? If not, can I try setting up a nightly build?

I'm not sure if what I'm seeing is intentional, but it appears that there's some kind of art missing.  Without knowing how this should look, it's difficult to describe if what I'm seeing is a bug.  Apologies on the poor quality of the photo (my camera is refusing to take a clear picture of my TV), but I think it's clear enough to see what I'm talking about.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Lollipop Notifications need visibility_public flag,[],"The notifications on Android 5 replace the lockscreen widget. The user can control how the notifications should be shown at the lockscreen. One option is to hide sensitive data. Google recommends to set the visibility of a notification that provides controls (no matter if as `RemoteView` or using the new `MediaStyle`): 

> Whichever approach you choose, make sure to set the notification's visibility to `VISIBILITY_PUBLIC`  so that your controls are accessible from the lock screen. [1]

or:

> Make sure to set the notification's visibility to `VISIBILITY_PUBLIC` to mark the notification as safe to show on any lock screen (secure or otherwise). For more information, see Lock screen notifications. [2]

This setting is missing in the current DSub notifications. This causes that the controls are hidden if the user choose to hide sensitive data. That make the notification useless - and DSub uncontrollable since they are the only possibility to control DSub from the lockscreen

Have a higher threshold for the automatic deletion of non-podcast bookmarks.

Perhaps just disable the auto delete when called from clear(), since that signals a change in context and not that we are done with the current bookmark.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,Unit tests,[],"Hi,

We did our best to implement some unit tests, according to your advice. We focused on the DownloadService class, but we also developped some tests on layout activities, and functionalities such as the comparotor. We met some difficulties to create unit tests because the application context, which is hard to instantiate for unit tests, is used by a lot of classes. Nevertheless we are happy to give you a little production. And we hope it will be useful to your project, it could help you to facilitate your future test development. Anyway it was a good experience for us. Thank you to let us contribute to your project.

If you have some feed back we would be glad to consider your suggestions.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,"Corrupted songs in cache, download and queue playing hangs","[Label(name=""bug"")]","Android : Tested on two different devices, one with 4.4.2 (i9505), one with 4.4.4 (Nexus10).
Subsonic : Tested with 4.7.8, but the problems were there with older versions too.
Server : Madsonic 5.0
All tested while devices are conncted via WLAN.

While caching songs that will be transcoded from server (e.g. FLAC) the download often hangs when the song is the current song to play. The app shows ""Buffering"" and the data seems to get downloaded but it fails to play the song while downloading. After the download is finished the app refuses to play the cached item even after touching the play icons several times.

Here's a log file from Subsonic for this case : 

https://athena.bockholdt.com/public.php?service=files&t=e31b1155700f74e129034845b97f4e8f

The cached songs are often corrupted, when playing the song the first seconds (or minutes) aren't played and it seems that the song hasn't been completely downloaded, parts are missing. After deleting the file and do a caching operation again  the file can be played and is healthy.

daneren2005/Subsonic,closed,File corrupted after resume,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","The title is not very clear so I'll try to explain correctly. Here is the context: 
I use my phone in my car to play podcasts.
I've automated everything so when I put my phone in the dock, the NFC chip starts Bluetooth and DSub with the command ""play"". The goal is to resume the last played song/podcast.

But I frequently have the same issue: there is no sound, so I turn on my phone and open DSub and I see that the length is incorrect (something like ""-424.223.146"") and the progression bar is to the max.
So I have to clear the playlist and restart manually the song.

And, a very annoying thing, when it was a podcast playing, it's automatically removed from cache and I have to download it again.

So, does someone is having the same issue?
Is there a setting in DSub to avoid automatic podcasts deletion after playing?

My device: I9305 with Android 4.3.

I think it's due to the fact that I'm forcing the use of HTTPS on my server, On the HTTP logs, I see that the song is requested (GET /ampache/play/index.php?ssid=[ssid]&type=song&oid=[oid]&uid=[uid]&name=[name]&client=DSub) and is answered with a 302 to redirect to HTTPS
But then, nothing on the HTTPS log, the app doesn't make any request (Then the Downloading [X] O with [X] that small may indicate that DSub takes the redirection page as the song)
I think it's not ampache-related because if I get the URL that the app request through a web browser, I get the entire song.

Decode: ffmpeg -i %s -ab %bk -v 0 -f wav -

Encode: opusenc --quiet --bitrate 52 --downmix-stereo --title %t --album %l --artist %a - -

Be sure to link opusenc in the subsonic encoder directory.

I know this encoding works fine, as Firefox can stream it directly fine. Downloading it (to avoid issues with self signed SSL certs) allows it to play in foobar2k as well.

Opus is really the perfect streaming codec - I found the quality to be transparent at ~48kbps, allowing a standard song to be 1.5mb or so. I live in a country with very expensive mobile data, so opus would make it practical to stream my music for considerably longer!

first let me thank you for the work you put into dsub! - It's an excellent app.

A feature that I would love to have is being able to start a shuffle playlist from anywhere in the library. 

At the moment one can click on the litte arrow-icon next to any item in the library list. Then we get a pop-up menu allowing to start shuffle mode by pressing ""Play shuffled"". This behaviour is ok imho, but if you are on your mobile data plan, this can take a while for a large folder. So what I want is a context menu Item to add a shuffled playlist with exactly the number of tracks that one can set up in the preferences. (Sure if the folder structure equals the files genre's, this can be done by pressing the shuffle button. but that's just not the fact for some of my libraries folders)

Best regards and thank you!

As it stands, with a cover.jpg in every artist/album folder, the photo gallery adds these as a a whole bunch of top level ""Albums""...sort of defeating the purpose of that view. 

Personally I'd be satisfied with a single albums folder in the sdcard/subsonic directory (as is done in the basic app). It still shows up in the photo gallery but is less impactful. 

Ideally I'd like it to simply use the album art in file tags (if they're available in the cache copies from the server)...That's the whole reason I spent hours of my life adding good images to my libraries meta data...
