GiorgioRegni/Binaural-Beats,closed,I would like to help with localisation,[],"I can help translating to Italian (with a very high accuracy). 
Thing is, people, especially the elders, sometimes have difficulties sleeping and I would like to introduce them to binaural waves listening.

Your app is the cleanest on the Play store, but it lacks translation and you can't expect 50+ yo to know English well enough to understand how to use your app, at least where I live.

So, want me to help? I'd be happy to do so!
And your app could reach way more people and possibly help them feel better!"

GiorgioRegni/Binaural-Beats,closed,Awesomified README,[],"Good evening, @GiorgioRegni! Since I really like your app and the work you've done so far, I really do not understand why your project lacks a great-looking `README`. These changes will not only polish your project a bit, but also very likely attract more users and developers. I am a very visual person myself. Let me know if you'd like to see anything changed before merging. Enjoy and continue hacking brainz! ;-)
- **Update:** I've sent an E-Mail to you, @GiorgioRegni. But maybe @antoniotari can merge this?

GiorgioRegni/Binaural-Beats,closed,Preset against lovesickness and broken heart,[],"Good morning @GiorgioRegni, first of all: Huge thanks for this neat app (although it looks like your repo is currently not very well maintained) and especially for publishing it on my belloved F-Droid store!

Here's my request: My girlfriend left me two days ago. It fuckin' hurts. I would love to have a preset designed to stabilize my inner feelings, glue my heart and get away from all the very deep pain. I am a strong man, I will get over it, but if your app could do a good job to assist people like me, that would rock. Before anyone tells me to use the already existing preset `Morphine pain killer`: It's not working here.
- **Update:** Seems like my girlfriend is coming back. I still would like this preset for others to appear.
