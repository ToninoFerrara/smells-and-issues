Kestutis-Z/World-Weather,open,Apparent temperature,[],"It would be interesting if the application could show the apparent temperature (at least optionally). In case the OpenWeatherMap API does not provide this value, it can be calculated with one of the following methods (the information belongs to [this plugin](http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-weather-plugin) for XFCE):
* [Windchill/Heat index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index): Used in North America, wind chill will be reported for low temperatures and heat index for higher ones. At night, heat index will be replaced by the [Summer Simmer Index](http://www.reahvac.com/tools/humidity-formulas/). For wind chill, wind speeds need to be above 3.0 mph (4.828 km/h) and air temperature below 50.0 Â°F (10.0 Â°C). For heat index, air temperature needs to be above 80 Â°F (26.7 Â°C) - or above 71.6 Â°F (22 Â°C) at night - and relative humidity at least 40%. If these conditions are not met, the air temperature will be shown.
* [Windchill/Humidex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidex): The Canadian counterpart to the US windchill/heat index, with the wind chill being similar to the previous model but with slightly different constraints. Instead of the heat index <i>humidex</i> will be used. For wind chill to become effective, wind speeds need to be above 2.0 km/h (1.24 mph) and air temperature below or equal to 0 Â°C (32 Â°F). For humidex, air temperature needs to be at least 20.0 Â°C (68 Â°F), with a dewpoint greater than 0 Â°C (32 Â°F). If these conditions are not met, the air temperature will be shown.
* [Steadman](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0434%281998%29013%3C1187%3ATSWCAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2): This is the model used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, especially adapted for the climate of this continent. Possibly used in Central Europe and parts of other continents too, but then windchill and similar values had never gained that much popularity there as in the US or Canada, so information about its usage is scarce or uncertain. It depends on air temperature, wind speed and humidity and can be used for lower and higher temperatures alike.
* Quayle-Steadman: Improvements by Robert G. Quayle and Robert G. Steadman applied in 1998 to earlier experiments/developments by Steadman. This model only depends on wind speed and temperature, not on relative humidity and can be used for both heat and cold stress.
 
Maybe it would be best to have all those methods in the configurations and let the user decide which one to use."

2. Replace `Type city name` for something like `City,Country`. Everyone knows they should type in that box. You can deliver more info with the same text length.
3. `How to search` is too long and redundant. Please take a look at [Android Writing Style](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/writing.html). I would take out the `How to search` title and replace it all for something simple such as:

> Country is optional. You can the 2-letter country code.
> Examples: ""London"", ""London,Great Britain"", ""London,GB""

Your app already gives a pop-up warning when you type less than 3 letters. Thus no need to mention that in the instructions.

Kestutis-Z/World-Weather,closed,Use releases for a seamless integration with F-Droid,[],"Until now, new builds have been added manually to F-Droid, as [was done for version 1.1.3](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests/1030).

But F-Droid has a nice feature to automate the entire build process: [Update Check Mode](https://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Update-Check-Mode). Unfortunately we cannot use `RepoManifest` mode, since in this project all version information is in [app/build.gradle](https://github.com/Kestutis-Z/World-Weather/blob/master/WorldWeather/app/build.gradle) instead of [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/Kestutis-Z/World-Weather/blob/master/WorldWeather/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).
We must opt for `Tags` mode. To do so we need you to create a new git tag everytime you release a new version. Such is really easy on GitHub: just [create a new release](https://github.com/Kestutis-Z/World-Weather/releases) and name it with the version number, e.g. `1.1.4`. F-Droid will automatically detect it and build the new version: great results for little effort ;).

Can you start doing this from now on?

PS. While creating a new release you might want to add the apk to it. That way users can get your app directly from GitHub.

PPS. I think you should add a download link in [README.md](https://github.com/Kestutis-Z/World-Weather/blob/master/README.md) to [World Weather F-Droid page](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=world+weather&fdid=com.haringeymobile.ukweather).
