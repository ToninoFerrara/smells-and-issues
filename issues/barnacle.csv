szym/barnacle,open,Unable to start (cm11 M8),[],"On d802 (LG G2), rooted, cyanogenmod 11 M8:

Barnacle does not start. Log ends with:

> Unable to open ./wifi: No such file or directory

Following [Debugging instructions](http://szym.net/barnacle/debugging/):

> shell@d802:/ $ su
> root@d802:/ # cd /data/data/net.szym.barnacle/files
> root@d802:/data/data/net.szym.barnacle/files # ./setup sh
> root@d802:/ # ./wifi load
> sh: ./wifi: not found

This is where starting with Start button fails.

I can not go any further...

szym/barnacle,open,Not connecting on Droid X2,[],"Not sure what the issue is since I'm getting no errors but this used to work flawlessly.  I'm assuming in the several weeks that I haven't used it there has been some update(s) that have broken the app.  

I have a Droid X2 running fully rooted 2.3.3 and trying to connect with a Windows 7 laptop (same laptop that worked previously).  I've tried every suggested setting (WEP on/off, Skip wpa_supplicant on/off, open SSID with no security, etc.) but nothing works, my laptop will try to connect then time out.

When starting Barnacle all I get is:

09:19:52  Starting...
09:19:52  Data network is ready
09:19:52  .ini file prepared
09:19:54  WIFI: driver loaded
09:19:54  Connected to NAT
09:19:54  Running...

Any ideas?

szym/barnacle,open,Droid Charge not working.,[],"I have as stated in the above a droid charge which is rooted and I cannot seem to get barnacle to start.  When I press start throught the GUI application it tells me....

""Could not set MTU of pdpbr1: Invalid Argument""

So through the adb shell i skipped over the ./dhcp and ./nat commands and went straight to the ./wifi assoc at which point I recieve the following error: 

""WIFI: Could not set the ad-hoc mode of eth0: Invalid argument""

Can I help you to figure out whats wrong with the app so it will work with my Rooted Samsung Charge? 

Thanks!

szym/barnacle,open,Auto start?,[],"It is frustrating that there is no way to have the connection started when the app opens.  The extra step of pressing the button to start the connection can be a real big pain when I am getting into my car, and attempting to connect my dash mounted tablet to my phone.  If it autostarted the connection upon application opening then I could use something like tasker to automate the connection.  Is this possible?  Other than that Barnacle is perfect.  I have no other complaints. Works like a charm, even where wifi tether couldn't.
