roelb/Simple-C25K,closed,feature request: please switch to alarm audio stream from notification,[],"Simple-C25K appears to be using TYPE_NOTIFICATION for its alerts. I turn off notifications while using the app, since I don't want to be bothered with emails or SMS's while I'm running. A better audio stream to use would be the alarm channel (TYPE_ALARM), in my opinion.

roelb/Simple-C25K,closed,Preference to make confirmation alerts optional,[],"Great app. Thanks for sharing.

I've added a preference that allows me to suppress the alert boxes (the 'are you sure (y/n)' etc.) Perhaps you'd like to make it available in your version. Default behaviour is unchanged. I have this version working reliably on my droid.

There are a couple of further modifications I'd like to help with too:
- long press a day in the list view could give an option to toggle the workout's completed status (gui tick)
- use the notification subsystem so you can choose notification sounds
- add a mid-distance notification so I know when to start heading home

Let me know if you'd be interested in further help.
