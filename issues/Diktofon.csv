The crash appears to be in the method `RecordingListActivity.addRecording(File file)`

I use the internal recorder mode `MY_ACTIVITY_RECORD_SOUND`

It looks like the argument `file` is already checked for `null` in `onActivityResult`

Maybe `mRecordings == null` because the `AsyncTask` for `loadRecordingsInBackground` hasn't finished?

Also, is it possible to get input from multiple microphones simultaneously (and record into separate tracks)? Is it possible that one microphone broadcasts to multiple Android devices simultaneously?
