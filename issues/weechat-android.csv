ubergeek42/weechat-android,open,"""Hot message"" notifications keep repeating since v0.13",[],"Steps to reproduce:
1. receive a ""hot message"" (eg. a highlight)
2. go to buffer in weechat android and read message: notification goes away
3. watch as the same notification for the same message pops up again after a while. Conditions for the notification popup to reappear are unclear: time? ""x"" new messages in buffer? I couldn't determine that precisely.
The only way to make the notifications go completely away is to acknowledge the hot messages directly in the weechat client itself.
I don't remember this from 0.12 or previous versions, but I might be wrong. I'll look for an older apk if I can."

ubergeek42/weechat-android,open,Reintroduce title in buffer list?,[],"Recently the buffer title was removed from the buffer list, and moved to the top of the scrollback.
However I found very useful the option to show the title in the buffer list, and I would like to know if it can be reintroduced.

Why? Having the title in the buffer list is very useful when using, for example, wee-slack to connect to Slack teams. Slack teams have a default #general channel, and it's now difficult to know which channel belongs to which team without opening it.
I'd be happy to help with testing - I am already enrolled in the beta testing program on the Play Store.
Thanks!"

when trying to connect to my weechat relay I have an error message saying:

Invalid Host
You are trying to connect to xxx.xxx.... but the certificate is only valid for these hosts:

But how can I do that in weechat-android ?

The password gets leaked into logs.  I wouldn't really call this a security issue, but it's not very hygienic.

I'd suggest making ""weechat"" the default websocket path.  Additionally, I'd hope that there is a better way of handling surfacing this failure mode to the user, but I'm not an expert on the protocols involved so I'm not sure how difficult this failure mode is to detect.

The problem is that very often (possibly depending on connection type) the connection gets closed before the out queue thread has a chance to write and flush the ""quit"" command to weechat. This means that in weechat core buffer shows an error like
```
=!= relay: reading data on socket for client 1/weechat/127.0.0.1: error 84 (connection closed by peer)
```
as opposed to the client quiting gracefully. It can be confirmed with `/relay raw` that weechat does not receive the ""quit"" command in these cases due to the race condition between the threads handling the connection as described above.

The only snag is that I also protect my ssh port with Fwknop (Next generation port knocking), so to connect to weechat, I have to send an fwknop packet from the Android app, Fwknop2, and then switch over to weechat and connect.

I'm actually the author of the Fwknop2 app, and I plan to add intent handling to Fwknop2 in the near future (Tracking it at https://github.com/jp-bennett/Fwknop2/issues/49).  It would be great to get the two apps working together, and would make for a much better user experience for anyone Fwknop to protect their ports.

This PR does the hostname verification **before** checking the certificate and shows a dedicated dialog with useful details for the user to debug.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,Tags for versions (F-Droid updates),[],"Hi,

Some users do not have Google Play on their device and rely on third party stores to get apps. Typically, I get most of my apps on F-Droid, including this one.

I think F-Droid relies on tags to check if new versions are available and build the APKs. Although version 0.12 is available, there is no associated tag on Github and (I guess) for this reason F-Droid users are stuck with 0.11.

Would it be possible to see if something can be done to fix this? Also, another option that could be interesting would be to host a third party F-Droid repository to serve Weechat builds directly, without relying on F-Droid compilation mechanism, the same way as it is done on Google Play.

Thanks!

```
// Copy current certs into our keystore so we can use it...
// TODO: don't actually do this...
```

Implementation summary:
- before: fill a single `Keystore` with all system certificates + all user certificates; check is done by `getTrustManagers()[0]`
- after: create a _system_ `TrustManager` (with system `KeyStore`) and a _user_ `TrustManager` (with user `KeyStore`); check is done by trying to check against the _system_, if that fails, the check is done against the _user_
- add a summary on the _Clear certificates_ preference with the user certificate count
- put hard-coded strings to `strings.xml`

This way, we don't need to copy all ~150 system certificates. Besides, we can now clear only the user certificates.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,open,Network connections not closed sometimes,[],"Hi,

I have a maximum number of connection set to 5 on my Weechat relay. I am only using Weechat for Android as a relay client (version from F-Droid).

Very often, it happens that the connection fails due to ""Connection reset by peer"". When checking the logs, there are a lot of clients still connected, which are actually ghost connections from my Android device with Weechat for Android, not closed by the app.

Actually, I manage to keep a connection open with Weechat for Android, while the app is closed (at least I do not have any permanent notification stating otherwise). I did not yet manage to figure out what exactly is happening, but I guess it has something to do with switching between connections (when I lose data network or when I switch from 3G to Wifi for instance).

I know at least two people having this issue, myself on Android 4.4.2 and F-Droid version, and another one on Android 6 and Google Play version. Anyone else is having such issue?

Thanks!

Change summary:
- preferences: replaces _volume button for text-size_ checkbox with a dropdown with three choices: _do nothing_, _text size_, _navigate send history_
- change implementation in `BufferFragment` to account for the new setting

Note that when the user starts to type something in `uiInput` _then_ decides to navigate history, this draft is stored so they can come back to it by pressing _volume down_ all the way.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,[feature request] Local relay host,[],"A nice feature that could be added, if anyone is up for it would be a local relay host.

The setting _Relay host_ would still be present, but _Local relay host_ and _Local relay host SSID_ would be added.
This would work as you would imagine - if you're not connected to the Wi-Fi network in _Local relay host SSID_, then use _Relay host_ as normal, otherwise, use _Local relay host_ to connect to weechat. Also, a checkbox to disable local settings might be good for people who only use weechat-android on their local network, where they should just use _Relay host_ as normal.  

I would find this very useful because I wouldn't have to keep changing the _Relay host_ in weechat-android when I have no Internet at home, which is quite frequently.

Example config:

| Relay host | Local relay host SSID | Local relay host |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| vps.my_website.com | HOME_WIFI | 192.168.1.15 |

Thanks! Just a suggestion,

    }
}
```

this code runs repeatedly to update the hotlist for both full and partial sync modes. `wants_full_hotlist_update` is determined by quering the last read line data in weechat, which is done every time before this function gets called. there are two problems with this code.

first, say in partial sync mode we have unopened buffer B that, according to w-a, has 5 unreads.
then it gets 2 more messages in weechat, and user opens it in w-a.
now, w-a sees the 7 unread messages but thinks that only 5 of them are unread, so it remembers that user read 5 messages.
now, if sync happens, and user is not watching the buffer (and branch Z is not run), branch Y will make w-a think 2 messages are unread, whereas the number should in fact be 0.
this will happen no matter the buffer is still open or not.

second, in any mode, user opeas buffer B in both w-a and weechat, and then
- receives a message in buffer B (1)
- switches to buffer C in weechat
- receives 1 highlight in buffer B
- navigates from buffer B in w-a
  at this point, 1 message is unread in weechat, and 0 messages are unread in w-a. now, update happens.
  event (1) results in `wants_full_hotlist_update` being set to true. branch X is run.
  now buffer B in w-a shows 1, whereas the number should be 0.

every solution to this problem i can think of, when i do, is ugly ugly ugly. halp.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,open,Try multiple DNS records when connecting,[],"Hi!

First off, I want to say that weechat-android is a great product and I'm happily using it for a while now. The new version was a huge improvement as well, the interface looks really slick now.

Due to problems with my network setup at home (NAT, broken modem, IPv4, you probably know what the problem is), I need to connect to my external IP address when not at home and to my internal IP address when I'm at home. Alternatively, if I have IPv6 connectivity I can just connect to the IPv6 address from anywhere, except that at home IPv6 is flakey on my phone due to a combination of Android versions and Modem firmwares (a problem not related to weechat-android at all).

My problem would be fixed with implementing multiple relays, as in: #160 #83. But I think these are difficult to solve quickly. I have an alternative solution and I'm curious if you are interested in that one.

I have a separate hostname for my weechat client, resolving both to the external IPv4, as well as the internal IPv4 address (and also the IPv6 address). I noticed that the source code uses http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/InetSocketAddress.html#InetSocketAddress(java.lang.String,%20int) to resolve the hostname, but that just takes the IPv6 or any of the IPv4 records, whichever comes first I guess. It does not try all of them.

Would you consider changing the code so it tries all IP-addresses, connecting to the first one that works (and retrying other records until it finds one)? I think this can be done with InetAddress.getAllByName (http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaAPI/java.net/InetAddressgetAllByNameStringname.htm), but it requires more code to loop through all of them + more error handling.

Please let me know if you would consider making this.

Thanks in advance!

What is happening is that it is searching for a hot buffer in the filtered buffer list. Is this intentional? I can understand that it is consistent and could be expected behavior but at the same time it can interfere in normal situations. 

For example:
I have a lot of buffers and I'm trying to to open # weechat to say hello there. I type ""weechat""  to filter the buffer list and see the filtered results and then I click through to open the #weechat buffer. 
Now I receive a hot message on buffer ##linux. I click the show hot message button, but guess what, it says I have no hot buffers for now 

Why? Because buffer list is still filtered by #weechat and ##linux is not part of the results to find a hot message on 

So either you can make the action to show hot messages work on all buffers, regardless of filtered buffer list views, or make it so that after filtering buffer list and changing to a buffer resets the buffer list filter upon a change to a buffer (so that show hot message works on the now unfiltered buffer list) 

Maybe there is another solution?

It seems that weechat-android was very active recently, and that many changes have been made since this version.

I've been using this interface for a few days now and I'm really happy with it. But I have some security concerns concerning the password handling... I don't have enough knowledge to dig into the code and see how it is handled in the back.

My concern is that I have to store my password in weechat-android configuration if I want it to work. And, if this password is not strongly protected, anyone could potentially read it (including evil apps).

I'm not a big fan of storing passwords on a pocket mobile device, and I was wondering if there could be a way to add a prompt for the password in a future version ?

ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,UI refresh for ICS devices,[],"First off, weechat-android is totally awesome. However, the UI feels very clunky on ICS devices. Employment of an action bar, elimination of menu actions, and use of new UI elements would make this client rock.

I've left a few comments elsewhere, but in testing out weechat-android I also gave AndChat a shot, connected to irssi-proxy. I'm not actually a weechat convert yet, but if the UI of weechat-android comes anywhere close to AndChat, I'll jump ship in a heartbeat.

2. run weechat, setup relay host/port/passord
3. connect

Easiest fix on this end is to just force a reconnect.
"
ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,Better connection/disconnection handling,"[Label(name=""duplicate"")]","Sometimes when using the app weechat shows the relay client as disconnected, but the app doesn't notice.  Maybe have the app periodically ""ping"" weechat(every 5 minutes?) and reconnect if it can't get a response(probably bad for battery life).  Or just have better handling for the connection stuff.

Sometimes app losing connection causes weechat to hang(badly for multiple minutes)

ubergeek42/weechat-android,open,Merged buffer support,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","At the very least for the status/server buffers.  A few possibilities:
- An item representing the merged buffers, that when clicked shows the individual buffers.  In this mode the lines wouldn't be merged together.
- A psuedo buffer that collects lines for all buffers, but tags them accordingly.  I think this might actually be the way to go(merge according to buffer number).

I like the second method best, and creating a psuedobuffer for the merged contents seems relatively simple.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,Bring back quick toggles,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","In the chat view, bring back menu->toggle timestamps, and menu->toggle filters.  Its annoying to go into the menu to change them.

I'd even consider adding a button near the top for each to toggle these two, as I find it quite common to be toggling them on/off.

Maybe a preference for ""show quick toggles"" so people who don't want them can maximize the space.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,Performance Improvements,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","1. Performance in a chatview is quite poor.  This could likely be improved by switching to a listview instead of the tableview, as then only the visible items need to be rendered.
2. Less object creation/more object reuse.  I can probably get away with a single Data object in RelayConnection.  Data can also be switched to use the java.nio.bytebuffer for some things, which may improve performance as well.
3. Maybe write custom textview that renders text in color based on the weechat color codes, rather than converting it to html and using the spannable stuff.  This should save a lot of silly computations.

ubergeek42/weechat-android,closed,Suggested features,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","I was hoping it would be possible to add an align option similar to ""weechat.look.prefix_align"". As is, it seems to be right justified. I prefer no justification of prefixes.

Was also wondering if it would be possible to include a tab complete nickname feature. Not sure if this would even be possible.

Not sure if this is necessary, but maybe for the relay password option have the password hidden.

Also, I like to keep my status buffers merged into one. Would be nice to have option to merge status buffers with core in the ap.

Thank you for this great ap!
