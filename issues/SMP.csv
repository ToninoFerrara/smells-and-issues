first of all: Thank you so much for SicMu player on F-Droid. I always wanted to have a file based music player like http://mpesch3.de1.cc/1by1.html (which was unfortunately never available on F-Droid). It is  great to use!

I wanted to report that it seems that landscape mode does not work outside settings menu. I'm using a slider smartphone whcih is in landscape mode when drawing out the hardware keyboard (xt894). I think it is just a bug because landscape mode works just fine when switching to settings.

At first I thought ""hmm, I enabled the possibly-non-standard media key support, maybe that's it"" but looking at the manifest xml and the media intent receiver class I don't see anything clearly wrong... the only explanation there would be if my phone were getting/sending a constant stream of media intents due to some hardware flaw...?

souch/SMP,open,"Feature Request: Custom ""Sort""/grouping styles","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The existing sort styles are useful, but at least the latter two seem somewhat arbitrary:

   * ""tree"" is clear, and may be best for people (like me) who are reasonably ""picky"" about how their music is organized on disk.
      * (except there is no option to see track number, it is used for sort only? Or is sort by filename?)
   * ""folder"" at first seems clear (flattened tree / leaf folders), except it also somewhat-opinionatedly subgroups by artist (but not album??)
   * ""artist"" also, when compared with ""folder"" you would assume it has all the songs of the artist in one pile, but it turns out this one does subgroup by album.

I see the possibility of introducing a ""genre"" grouping is already noted in the README.md (but not todo.txt?) - it seems that making the grouping definitions customizable would be a worthwhile investment...

""Power users"" would be able to add or modify their own options, and ideally even disable/hide options that don't make sense to them, somewhere in advanced settings (but the quick pick list would still be simple/uncluttered and out of the box there would still be a small number of simple options there)"
souch/SMP,closed,"Feature Request: Make ""shuffle"" option easier to reach","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I often ask my music player to play something random (across my whole collection, or across a genre), and skip from random song to random song until I find something I want to listen to at that moment. Then I typically disable shuffle (and maybe go back to the first song in the album).

SicMu makes this slightly harder than I feel it should ideally be, because it treats shuffle as a ""Setting"" on the separate settings page (that you then need to back out of, after having changed your selection).
I'm not sure what the best approach is to fixing this... Maybe adding a third row of quick settings on the quick popup in the corner?"
souch/SMP,open,Feature Request: More granular Repeat and Shuffle scope selection,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I only just realized that the ""Repeat Group"" setting also applies to Shuffle (when set to ""Group"", as opposed to ""All"" or ""Track""), which is great!

What I am missing, personally, is the ability to define which grouping level that is. I have my personal music collection organized by folders as ""Genre"" - ""Artist"" - ""Album"", and I would love to be able to Shuffle within a Genre or Artist (without leaving the lovely tree view).

I realize the different views have different number of levels, and the ""Tree"" view in particular can have asymmetrical levels (different depths in different parts of the list), so this is non-trivial to implement, but I see at least two possible approaches:

   * Add a (numeric-ish) ""Group Level"" selector on the ""Repeat Group"" selection UI, so that if you choose ""Repeat Group"", you can choose from ""which group"", with options like these. ""Leaf Level"" would be a special value with the current existing behavior. 
      * ""Leaf Level""
      * ""Top Level""
      * ""2nd Level""
      * ""3rd Level""
      * ""4th Level""
      * (more? make this a numeric selection?)
   * (and/or)
   * Introduce the concept of a ""Current Selected Group"" in the tree UI - so that you can see, and/or set, what group the ""Shuffle"" and ""Repeat"" behaviors are applying to - eg by long-pressing the group.

I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 running crDroid (which is based on LineageOS, Android 7.1.2)

I got the sources from Github, and uncommented the line that logs the
filenames being scanned (in Settings.java), compiled, installed and checked the logs:

```
    private void scanMediaFiles(Collection<File> filesToScan) {
        String[] filesToScanArray = new String[filesToScan.size()];

            filesToScanArray[i] = file.getAbsolutePath();

However, no files from Syncthing's folder in the exteral SD card show up in Sicmu. I have waited several minutes after rescanning the media, but it did not work. I also tried killing Sicmu and even rebooting.


If I create a folder

and include an mp3 file there, Sicmu *will* find and include it. But inside

it seems to scan the files, but not include them.

What could be going on?

souch/SMP,open,access buttons in the screenlocker,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","My phone is often locked (auto-lock after some time).
It would be very useful to have a quick access to most useful features while locked.
The default player of Android 4.4 provides this feature.

Thus: Possibility to have play/pause/mutt/prev and next button in the screenlocker would be a very useful feature.

Side note: many thanks for this player. This the best player so far most notably thanks to be folder-based. Keep up the good work!

souch/SMP,closed,Update Serbian,[],
souch/SMP,closed,"Feature request: please add ""folder tree"" view","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Some people (like me :) ) use to organise their audio files in a folder tree/hierarchy, for example I use the first level of the tree for main categories (music, podcasts, work/teaching stuff, etc), the second level for the ""author"" (artist, or podcast author etc), the third level for ""album"" (or similar) and so on.

Now, nearly all android music players (including SMP) provide a ""by folder"" view, but this is a flattened list of all folders and subfolders, where the nesting/level/tree information is lost, so navigating to the desired folder is quite cumbersome, when you have hundreds of folders.

I would like to have a ""folder tree"" view, where I can quickly navigate from the root folder to the desired subfolder; by ""tree"" I don't mean it should graphically appear as a tree: it should appear as a list of folders, starting from the (user defined) root folder, just like the current ""by folder"" view of SMP;  clicking on each folder should present a list of its subfolders and so on, just like in traditional file managers.

souch/SMP,closed,Long press on prev/next icons doesn't seek back/forward,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I don't know if this is a feature not implemented, or a bug on my old android 2.3 device: I would expect that a long press on the ""prev"" and ""next"" icons would seek backwards or forward in the current track (like in the standard music player). This doesn't happen: the player skips to previous/next track instead.

souch/SMP,closed,suggestions,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","the fontsize makes it too flimsy. I tried 25-30 for the title-textview, seems ok(for me).
I think a swipe zoom would cause unexpected behavior, maybe bigger/smaller buttons in menu can do the job?

in artist view tabbing the artist should expand only the album level.

please implement  audioeffect/equalizer  as the old stockplayer does.

just my 5ct, as a 1by1 fan I like it already
