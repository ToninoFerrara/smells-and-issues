tobykurien/GoogleNews,open,Use of Deprecated CookieSyncManager,[],"Hi there,

I just found that GApps Browser is still using CookieSyncManager which has been [deprecated since Lollipop](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieSyncManager.html). I found invocations of this API on [line 35 in WebviewClient.java](https://github.com/tobykurien/GoogleApps/blob/0d20a75b2e17a0fdded3d79f155c6f7473cc2ea6/src/com/tobykurien/google_news/webviewclient/WebClient.java#L35) and [line 72 in GoogleNewsActivity.java](https://github.com/tobykurien/GoogleApps/blob/1fee512e7481ca1408cf244a45bf8dce0449678c/src/com/tobykurien/google_news/GoogleNewsActivity.java#L72).

A better implementation may be to use CookieSyncManager on lower API levels and use APIs of CookieManager to manage the cookies. I found a reference post in stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30502411/cookiesyncmanager-is-now-deprecated-what-can-i-use-instead)

This is pervasive and makes it so that sometimes I'm simply unable to start the app. Sometimes it helps if I wait a bit, and then open the app later. But this is random. Another thing that helps at times is if I go the App, stop it, clear cache, and then restart. But again this is random.

I logged into Voice on Firefox and it appears they have an updated mobile site that allows the audio to be played from within the browser instead of attempting to download the audio to play on the device.  It would be great if the updated site could be used within GApps Browser.

Thanks a lot.

Unrelated: two things I really like about this release are the ability to hide apps I don't use, and that Maps works again in this release. Keep up the good work! :)

I started using your application a couple of days ago, it is a great idea, thanks!

But I've found a problem that is pretty annoying for using Plus: if I am browsing my main feed, and click on a story to read it in full, and then go back (either with the phone's button, or with the link in the web page) I get back to a different place. Sometimes it is just a different feed, starting a day or two ago, or just to the beginning of the feed. Both cases make it very painful to use G+.

tobykurien/GoogleNews,open,Allow sharing files,[],"Hello!

I don't know if this is considered a feature or an anti-feature, but I am going to ask nevertheless.

Lately the g+ website has been updated and works way better than it used to. One of the changes is that now it's possible to attach pictures to posts. Using the function from the browser yields the following message in logcat

I/ActivityManager(10908): START u0 {act=android.intent.action.CHOOSER cmp=android/com.android.internal.app.ChooserActivity (has extras)} from pid 25552

I guess GoogleNews is not allowed to fire this intent, because the link does not work and nothing appears in logcat.

So my question is if you could consider adding this function, or if it would defeat the aim of requiring the minimum set of permissions that is possible.

Kind regards.

I have no idea if this is possible, but thought it could be helpful for separating out workflows.

I know it doesn't belong to this repo, but I'd like to suggest that you enable auto-updates of your app in f-droid. Here's how I did it for my app, just change:
Auto Update Mode:None

Then you can add to each tag a message like ""Version X.XX"" and f-droid will pick your update automatically. Please see my own app metadata: (https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroiddata/source/a27e409f3ae14f3cade89b97fe427fc5f437e1ff:metadata/org.dgtale.icsimport.txt#L29) as well as the tags I use (https://github.com/danielegobbetti/ICSImport/releases )if you need it.

A couple potential solutions:
- Detect redirects (in an authentication flow?) vs. links, and handle them differently. Might break links that bounce through Google for tracking and then redirect off-site, though.
- Provide a 'turn off capture' mode that opens all pages in the GApps Browser. I could turn this on when I'm completing the auth flow, and turn it back to normal once I'm authenticated and have a Google cookie.
