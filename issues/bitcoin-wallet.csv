schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,Sweep parer wallet,[],"Hello,
I used sweep parer wallet functionality to transfer balance from private key.
Transaction is sent and received in other device history.
But when I go to block chain site to check confirmation, it displays ""No transaction found with hash"".
Please help who know this.
Thanks."
schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,massive number of DNS requests,[],"looking at a network trace of my android device, I saw that starting bitcoin wallet generates at startup immediately ~4000 DNS requests for ""A bitseed.xf2.org"" and ""A bitcoin.bloqseeds.net"". All those requests are being ent so fast that the server did not even have time to send a single reply. Both DNS names also have broken DNS servers obviously and they time out (maybe they are unreachable because of too many queries from various bitcoin wallet devices?).
My DNS server that is used also logs errors due to the massive amount of DNS queries generated by bitcoin wallet.
Bitcoin wallet should stop those requests as soon as possible and make sure that only a single DNS request for those names is being done."

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Change Derive Path,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","Hello,

I've used bitcoinj wallet and used derive path as below.

`public static final ImmutableList<ChildNumber> ACCOUNT_ZERO_PATH = ImmutableList.of(ChildNumber.ZERO_HARDENED);`

But I made changes in above path for generating bip44 standard addresses.

`public static final ImmutableList<ChildNumber> BIP44_ACCOUNT_ZERO_PATH =ImmutableList.of(new ChildNumber(44, true), new ChildNumber(0, true), new ChildNumber(0, true));`

Now As I load wallet in application then it loads from backup and app crashes because it took old derive path and I changed it.

So it won't find old derive path and app crashes.

How can I change derive path?

Please help.

Thanks."

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,Battery optimization on Android 8.0 prevents the wallet from syncing,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Android 8.0 has introduced a battery optimization change that creates limits on how freely apps running in background can access to the device's resources. This prevents bitcoin-wallet and other apps connected to the Bitcoin network from syncing the blocks when the app is running in background.

Luckily this can be solved by going to ""Special app access"" in the device's settings and deactivate the battery optimization feature for individual apps.

Since if not addressed this prevents users from being able to use the wallet, I suggest to at least put a helper message somewhere to guide users in deactivating the battery optimization for bitcoin-wallet.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,Update to previous guide,[],"https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/README.recover.md

The above guide is useful for people wanting claim forked coins. However it demands certain basic knowledge that isn't possessed by anyone. I tried to familiarize myself with some linux basics before following the above guide but still after a lot of tries i can't come past the decryption.

After entering my password (that i am absolutely sure is correct) i get the return:
'bad magic number'

Could it be possible that the guide is outdated? 
Just to make sure, it is correct that you cannot see the password while typing it right?

I understand it might not be the questions or remarks that you are waiting for, i hope you can spend a little time at it.

The transaction was 226 bytes and Bitcoin Wallet computed a fee of 0.05 mBTC, about $0.30, or 22 satoshi/byte. According to https://bitcoinfees.21.co/, this fee is way too low. Anything below 100 sat/byte might take days to go through, or never clear at all.

So today I tried bumping the fee with the ""Raise network fee"" function, but this time the computed value is way too high: 0.94 mBTC, or 415 satoshi/byte. This is equivalent to $5.64.

However, it seems to be fairly non trivial to get the private keys out of a bitcoin wallet, in order to get them into a BCC compatible wallet and send the BCC to an exchange.

The docs indicate you control your keys, but we need a readme that details how to get keys out, and preferrably how to get them into a BCC wallet, for instance the bitcoin core clone bitcoinABC wallet.

i have gotten as far as to using wallet-tool dump --dump-privkeys on a decrypted wallet backup but i can't seem to find any private keys in the resulting output.

output looks like this , i can't find anything that can be imported into e.g. a bitcoin core style wallet (bitcoinABC for instance)

also tried raw-dump --dump-privkeys in that case there was some encrypyted_private_key fields, containing what looked like encoded binary data, but these data did not look like anything that could be pasted into a core wallet as a private key.

I could give up, but then I would lose BCC equivalent to about BTC 3 at current rates, because i believed that it was possible to get the private keys out of  bitcoin wallet, that claims that it makes you control your private keys.

so... please put in a readme explaining how people can get at their BCC if they had BTC stored in their schildblatz going into the fork.  it's quite a lot of money that's gone missing, for me alone it's more than 7000 USD at current rates.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,RaiseFeeDialogFragment: Fix amount of raise too high because it isn't…,[],"…adjusted for transaction size.

Fixes #381."
schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,"""Raise network fee"" assumes 1kB transaction & selects excessive fee",[],"When using the ""raise network fee"" option, Bitcoin Wallet for Android 5.14 disregards the fee category the transaction was initially sent at (ECONOMIC, NORMAL, PRIORITY) but blindly takes the PRIORITY fee value, and multiply it by 2 (hence implicitly assuming a transaction of 1kB since PRIORITY is supposed to be a value in sat/kB):

~~~
// RaiseFeeDialogFragment.java
feeRaise = data.get(FeeCategory.PRIORITY).multiply(2);
~~~

This causes unnecessarily high fees. I noticed this after I had a small 225-byte transaction stuck unconfirmed after 10 mined block despite a fee of ~28000 sat (~126 sat/B, a NORMAL fee). When I tried to raise its network fee it generated a second 192-byte tx with a fee of 320000 sat (2 multiplied by PRIORITY which is 160000 in https://wallet.schildbach.de/fees at the moment).

So in total I paid ~348000 sat for 417 bytes or ~835 sat/B, which is **4 times higher than necessary** according to https://bitcoinfees.21.co which recommends ~220 sat/B for an estimated delay of 0 blocks. 

IMHO the code should be changed to properly compute the fee in sat/B instead of assuming a 1kB transaction. And I question the validity of picking 2*PRIORITY. Shouldn't the logic of raising the fee be ""pick the next higher-category fee"" and only if at PRIORITY already, multiply by 2 (or 1.5 or some other less drastic value)?

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,enabling dynamic prices on static QR codes - reconsider BIP 72 compliance?,[],"I have an interesting use case that is made impossible due to the [BIP 72 incompatibility](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/issues/94): enabling dynamic prices on static QR codes.

We are selling some products at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin emBassy using static BIP 21 QR codes that are printed and attached to the products (see the jars on the right [here](http://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EMBASSY_8275.jpg), or a closeup [here](http://www.bitembassy.org/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/IMG_8590.jpg) [0]). The problem is that keeping these QR codes updated to reflect the current exchange rate is quite an hassle, leading to prices constantly getting out of sync (our bamba is currently twice more expensive than it should be!) 

My solution was to create a little service ([shesek/bitcoinuri](https://github.com/shesek/bitcoinuri)) that dynamically generates payment requests based on the current exchange rate. The final bitcoin URI, with this service embedded, looks like that:

    bitcoin:1EoNrcZmCpZK1Zzpo5Yey9dvtFQk8t9aiU?amount=0.015&r=https://bitcoinuri.herokuapp.com/1EoNrcZmCpZK1Zzpo5Yey9dvtFQk8t9aiU/15/USD

I was hoping that this would allow older wallets to use the BIP 21 static price, while newer wallets use the BIP 70 payment request to fetch the updated price from the server. But, as you probably already figured out... I learned that this doesn't actually work :-(

So, my question is: is there any chance you would reconsider relaxing the rules relating to the BIP 70 payment request matching the BIP 21 details? I see two options here:

1. Skip the checks when no address/amount is specified (the `bitcoin:?r=https://...` URI format). This would be an improvement, but it won't work at all for wallets without payment protocol support.

2. Just skip the checks entirely, even if the address/amount is specified. This would be the most ideal solution for my needs, as it would gracefully degrade on older wallets.

I understand that there are some security concerns here, but I think that at least for the case of scanning a QR code they're pretty negligible. Unlike with clickable payment links, where the user can be deceived by showing him one amount in the BIP 21 URI (when he hovers the link) and then using a different amount in the actual BIP 70 payment request, users scanning a QR code have nothing to compare the BIP 70 amount to (unless they're able to [manually read QRs](http://blog.qartis.com/decoding-small-qr-codes-by-hand/)), meaning that there's no option of deceiving anyone due to the mismatch.

Are there any other security concerns that I'm not considering?

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,[Feature Request] Support for Tor network (via Orbot),"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",Something nice and maybe (hopefully rather) straightforward to implement that I would like to see is (optional) support for Tor (via Orbot). It would add some additional level of anonymity - it would require the traffic to be routed to the local proxy provided by Orbot (additionally the app could check if Orbot is running already or start it). Far from being critical - but nice to have at some point :-)
schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Configurable fee rates,[],"It would be useful to be able to set an option for satoshis-per-byte in the *settings* view for each priority category, and be able to select the priority, normal, economy rates on the *send coins* view. I haven't been able to find this option with latest prerelease of 5.06.

The defaults are currently creating transactions that take longer than 1-12 blocks *(about 4 hours for confirmation)* for a 226 byte transaction (with 45 satoshis per byte). While it may be desirable to keep the fees low and wait, there is also the need to send quickly with an option to bump the priority in advance without creating a second transaction to raise the fee *(child-pays-for-parent policy does not seem to be active with miners yet)*.

Looks like dynamic fees were added in 5.02 to help address this, however the current values returned from https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/commit/067115374109e1c1fd5aab5b5233dbd8ff578eaa#diff-b78401012ef4433bbf5f6c011edc80f2R106 are the same values as https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/commit/067115374109e1c1fd5aab5b5233dbd8ff578eaa#diff-89ff4677de1f2796e54b26e412f5297d and isn't configurable.

Rates could optionally be suggested based on the current estimates from the `estimatefee` bitcoin rpc method. (See: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d932159f3467cc197caaf281f34f3324e6b5bea8/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L774) This is currently available via https://blockexplorer.com/api/utils/estimatefee?nbBlocks=2,3,4,5

By my estimate [and experiments](https://github.com/Giszmo/TransactionFinder) it would cost ""only"" 3GB on the user's phone to have an index of all **relevant** transactions. What is relevant depends on the wallet but for the Schildbach wallet only P2PKH transactions would be relevant, right? So instead of waiting hours to resync the blockchain, users would wait minutes to parse the local index when an address of unknown age gets added and only relevant blocks could get downloaded in full."

For example in the onDestroy method of the BlockhacinServiceImpl you are using the onStop() method of the peergroup when is a bloquing method and therefore you are bloquing the UI thread. use StopAsync instead or do the work in background.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,Added experimental Android payment channel support,[],"I've added experimental payment channel support to Bitcoin Wallet.

This works by exposing an Android service that other apps may connect to using the provided AIDL interface.

I've also included a set of demos that show how such integration might work. In a real-world scenario the app that talks to the service (game, etc) should use a server-side bitcoinj instance and then forward messages from the Bitcoin Wallet service to its remote server, but that's too implementation specific to cover in a demo app.

This feature is disabled by default, and can be enabled in settings.

This code requires the master version of bitcoinj currently (there's code in bitcoinj master not yet in 0.13.5 etc) so there are three commits on the beginning that need to be removed before merge that tell gradle to find `bitcoinj-0.14-SNAPSHOT` in the maven local repo.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,"allow ""panic button"" apps to lock Bitcoin","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","We (Guardian Project) have been developing ""panic button"" features in our apps for years, and now we are working to make a more flexible and open ecosystem of apps that can both trigger other apps, or respond to triggers. This whole PanicKit system allows for easy configuration of a single trigger action which can then trigger multiple apps. Since money handling should be as private as possible, Bitcoin is a natural panic responder app, for example, by having Bitcoin lock when the ""Spending PIN"" is enabled and a panic message is received.  Or Bitcoin could even delete the local wallet, provided it was backed up, of course.

You can see an example of the panickit user experience in this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS1gstS6YS8

It is simple to implement, here are some examples of other apps:
- https://github.com/SMSSecure/SMSSecure/pull/290
- https://github.com/theScrabi/NewPipe/pull/133
- https://github.com/bpellin/keepassdroid/pull/72

The first panic button app that sends this kind of trigger is called Ripple, and it is available here:
https://github.com/guardianproject/ripple
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple

I'm adding support to this app right now:
https://panicbutton.io/
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iilab.pb

We hope to inspire all sorts of panic trigger apps, anything from geo-fences to custom harware deadman switches. More info on the panic kit work here:

This is above the dust threshold for the old default minrelaytxfee of 0.00001 (546 satoshis), but falls short with respect to the new default of 0.00005 (2730 satoshis).

The dust limit probably needs to be dynamic as well.  The easiest way is perhaps to peg the dust limit to the transaction fee rate; i.e. assume that the network minrelaytxfee is equal to the tx fee rate that you are paying.

After I found out that I don't have peers, even after editing the ""trustfully peers"" I asked my BTC-Buddy why.

It seems that the app is not working if you have not enough space on the sd card. Yes I have more then one app. So I constantly ignored the ""Delete all other app but mine""-popup, that why ever leads to the app settings instead of leading to the memory settings.

Somewhere I read, that my coins are in danger if I don't have enough space. But there was no single word about how much space is actually needed. In stead it the app working as expected but has no sync.

This is very bad user experience.

I was using 2 addresses whose private keys were in the backup. I had restored the backup successfully before. Now, after my backup is imported with version 4.13, a balance of 0 is reported.

My guess is that this has to do with the feature in version 4.0 where bitcoin wallet started sending the change to a new address instead of sending it back to the sending address. I verified on a blockchain explorer that my coins are indeed on another address.

But I read in a google+ comment on the bitcoin community from the owner (https://plus.google.com/104452239642782609405/posts/GuuWrWA78T1): ""When upgrading from pre-v4 to version 4.x, the seed for all your future addresses is deterministically derived from the first of your old addresses. So refreshing your backup is not required. Of course, it doesn't hurt either.﻿""

There are two practical problems with that:
- pretty much all devices have bluetooth, however some are not equipped with NFC
- currently most POS solutions are based on regular phones/tablets without any accesories. This requires turning POS upside down in order to tap NFC antenna that is pretty much always on the back of the device. This is impractical. Perhaps it is one of the reasons why we see almost no implementations of your solution

I own a droid eris, rooted with a gingerbread rom. I know, it's a pretty old phone, but it works for email and most simple apps. The newer versions of this app caused intermittent freezing, and I figured it was because of the limited ram on the phone. As I've updated other apps and google services, I'd get more crashes until at some point I could not send bitcoins anymore. I managed to backup the wallet however.
After backing up the wallet (this is a key step, don't forget to do this part), I uninstalled the app, and tried reinstalling it, but had the same problems. It would especially tend to freeze somewhere along the process of synchronizing. I know bitcoinj is pretty efficient at only grabbing what parts of the blockchain it needs, but maybe that was still too much. I think I had about 25mb of ram left before reinstalling the app, maybe less.
Next, I found the release below which was the oldest one still using this form of backup. I also had older backups so I was fairly confident I'd be ok.
I moved the apk to the phone and installed it with package manager, dismissed the prompt to update, and imported the backup. After synchronizing, I sent the coins to my mycelium app, which has been working fine so far, but I promise I'll get a new phone as soon as I can.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Wallet taking very long time to sync,[],"I recently got a new phone and imported the wallet from the old one. The app has been synchronizing now for a few weeks and can't seem to get past ""8 months behind"". It got to 9 months behind within one day, spent a day or two at 9 months, and has been at 8 months ever since. I have the Connectivity Indicator notification turned on and there are always connected peers, but I can't see anything else to indicate it hasn't become stuck.

I have also noticed that the app is prone to crashing (I noticed this to a larger degree on my old phone too, perhaps because it was fully synchronized). When the app crashes, the connectivity indicator remains in the notification drawer, but I'm not sure if it actually is continuing to sync at this time.

Is there a way to check that syncronization is actually progressing and hasn't stagnated? Is there any information I can provide to help with debugging?

I'm not sure why the Bluetooth service cannot be created, even though Bluetooth availability was checked before. But I decided to change the code so that the service wouldn't be created in the constructor, but instead as part of the run() method where the exception can be easier dealt with. The new code should prevent crashes, when listening via Bluetooth is for some reason not possible.

I think this change would be nice to see upstream. Submitted for your consideration. =) Cheers!

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Decrypting backup wallet in linux.,[],"Hi there,
I am using the wallet on my Z30. The wallet version was ""3.54-blackberry"". I only use this to put money from the BTC ATM. I've been putting money in once a month for a few months now and want to send it out to other wallet.

The application told me that I can't only send some amount as there are some transaction unconfirmed. I check the list and it was old transaction like months ago (one in Aug) which said ""This payment shoud become spendable in a few minutes"".

Firstly, how can I resolve this?

I checked the blockchain and clearly it is there.

Anyhow, I can't spend it from the wallet so I backup the wallet. Then try to get the private key.

I use the command

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in bitcoin-wallet-backup-2014-09-20 -out ""backupfile.out"" -k ""--my password here--""

Then I got binary file starting with ...

org.bitcoin.production \00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00 ...

NOTE: I am on Ubuntu Linux

How can I get my private key?

Thanks in advance and sorry for my English.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Testnet version not synchronizing,[],"Hello Andreas,

I am trying to connect the testnet version of the app to a localnet without success.
The blockchain is retrieved from testnet3 (official testnet) without problem.
I switched the trusted peer to my localnet:port and checked the 'skip regular peer discovery'.
Then I reset the blockchain but it remains at 6 weeks.

Isn#t the above like:
bitcoind -datadir=./localnet/ -testnet -dnsseed=0 -connect=mylocalnet:myport  ???

I did debug the network connections and see no connection coming in from the testnet app.
Is it expected to work? Would a 'connect to localnet' checkbox a possible option to implement?

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,the available balance not equal with the estimate balance when sending bitcoins,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","Using you opensource code, I add some code to monitor the total btc balance and print the log below. In this log, the first data is the available bitcoin balance and the second data is the estimate bitcoin balance. As I send some bitcoins to another wallet, you can see the available bitcoin balance is not equal with the estimate balance for some time. And maybe about 3 minutes later, the available bitcoin balance recovered and equal with the estimate balance. However, this phenomenon doesn't happen every time when sending bitcoins, it is random event. When I send bitcoin rather frequently, sometime i will fail to send the coin, and the fail information is ""you have some coin waiting for the network confirm"", however the coin is confirmed by network for a long time. I want to know the reason and hope you can fix it. The log is placed below, thank you very much!

ps: i use the func of ""bitcoinj"" lib to get the available and estimate bitcoin balance.

Quoting the BIP:

> If the ""r"" parameter is provided and backwards compatibility is not required, then the bitcoin address portion of the URI may be omitted (the URI will be of the form: bitcoin:?r=... ).
> 
> When Bitcoin wallet software that supports this BIP receives a bitcoin: URI with a request parameter, it should ignore the bitcoin address/amount/label/message in the URI and instead fetch a PaymentRequest message and then follow the payment protocol, as described in BIP 70.

bitcoin-wallet reports ""Fetching signature failed: wrong signature!"" instead of generating the requested payment when presented with a valid BIP 72 link.

Here's the test case:
https://www.syndicoin.co/demo.html

There are three test payment requests on that page.  None of them load correctly using the BIP 72 link, but they do load correctly when downloaded and opened directly.

Thanks for your efforts!

Edit to add:

This bug is perhaps illustrated best by the text I've written explaining the workaround for users of bitcoin-wallet:

> ... you must use the ""download"" link and then open the payment request from your downloaded files.
> To scan a QR code into bitcoin wallet is also cumbersome.  You must first scan the download QR code using a scanner **outside** bitcoin-wallet.  Then, once the file is downloaded, tap it to launch bitcoin-wallet and pay it.

It would be particularly useful to be able to import private keys from the graphical user interface in a friendly manner (QR code scan) now that more people are using them to give Bitcoin as gift, and more ATMs are being installed that print paper wallets. Being able to import vanity addresses and moving Bitcoin from off-line/cold-storage would also benefit from this and make Bitcoin Wallet feature-complete for such use cases.

When such wallets need to be imported, right now the only other options are either third party websites and services you have to trust implicitly (like blockchain.info) or applications that can't be redistributed and shared frely because of their choice of restrictive licensing (most notable, mycellium).

This bug report mentions it's possible as documented in the README but the current version of such file doesn't mention it (Nov.2012) - it actually refers to re-importing backups from the same app:

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Feature idea: Bitcoin URIs and payment requests embedded in http links to be clickable in more places,[],"Hi Andreas,

my understanding is, that Android allows to set intent filters on web links for a specific domain or path pattern (for example the YouTube app does so for YouTube links). I was thinking it might be useful to specify certain 'magic' links, for example:

```
https://bitcoin.org/intents/bip21/175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=1
```

which would simply be an alternative way of specifying:

```
bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=1
```

The app could then set a filter for https://bitcoin.org/intents/bip32 and be registered as a handler for these links.

The advantage would be, that these links are also clickable in a text message, a Hangout message or even a Whatsapp message, where bitcoin-URIs are not (yet) recognized.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Jan

However, I have an internal storage which I can connect via USB to a computer and then read the files. Can you support writing the files to the internal storage so that I can read them via USB?

Thank you.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Is it a good idea to include block headers with .apk package?,[],"Hello, thank you dev(s) for excellent app. I think it's a good idea to include the block headers with the apk, such that when the user downloads the app from the Google Play marketplace, the headers are downloaded as well. I don't think this violates the trust model at all, because the app compiler or Google could modify the code anyway.

Use case: Suppose the user pays for cellular data and has intermittent wifi. User downloads the app on wifi, but doesn't run it yet. Currently, the user must then use cellular data to download the headers to use the app. If the headers were included in the app, the user would use wifi to download the headers and the app would load more quickly. Furthermore, the user would know the app will use X space, rather than initially thinking the app will take ~3MB and it turns out it takes over 20MB. 

Finally, the headers size of ~19mb is the perfect size for this feature: it's large enough that pre-downloading is worth the effort, but small enough that the Google marketplace will host the data.

Cheers

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,backup reminder,[],"I think it would be interesting to add a backup reminder, I've just updated my cyanogenmod and forgot that flashing the firmware erases the apps and their data.

Now I installed and created a backup after that. Sent an email with the copy to me, parhaps this may be ""enforced"", since many users may not know the risks.

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,closed,Difference between github and googlecode repos?,[],"I am updating to start using bitcoinj 0.8

In the `README` file: https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/README 

it says the developer should clone https://code.google.com/p/bitcoin-wallet/ bitcoin-wallet but I have been using the github code.

Which is the difference?

I noticed that wallet's pom.xml file is not using `<classifier>android</classifier>`.

Why's that?

schildbach/bitcoin-wallet,open,"""up"" button on ""send coins"" screen doesn't always go up ",[],"As I'm sure you know, the ""up"" button on the action bar is supposed to go to the above screen in the application, rather than the previously visited screen like the ""back"" button does. If I am not using the main wallet activity, and I scan an NFC tag containing a bitcoin URL, the ""Send Coins"" activity appears, as I'd expect. (I assume but haven't checked that this works the same way if I get the URL by other means, such as by clicking a link in a browser.) This activity has the ""up"" button in the action bar. When I tap it, I would expect to go to the main wallet activity, but it instead goes back to the activity I was using before.

I only noticed because I've been looking at the same problem in my app today :-)
