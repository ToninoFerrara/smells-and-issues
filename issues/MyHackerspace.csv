This causes the widget to create Toasts with ""No Route to host"" when I'm in the middle of doing other things, and it was not easy to even find out which app is responsible for that.

This is propably an edge case, but nevertheless very annoying to my.

I don't think it's a good idea to use toasts for errors from a widget, especially if there is no context for the message. A Toast with just ""No route to Host"" when I'm on my homescreen does not give me any Information I would need to anything about the cause (and it gets really annoying after a few times).

I'm not sure what the best way to fix this is. Maybe creating a Notification, to at least give context for the Message and maybe more information and time.
But it might get just as anoying in a case like mine to get Notifications every few minutes, but at least the can disable notifications on a per app basis in current Android versions.

First when the spaces'  ""state"" was changed the image was updated. Strangely enough this ought also to happened monday evening when the labs was open.

I just did some quick experiments that showed that when fiddling around with the widgets they do update, at least when the image url changes from invalid->valid (I just renamed the file on the server to test).

in Net.java's toString() method there's the following check:

That leads to issues if a the response is a 301/302 redirect to a `status.json` file.

```

Check if the response code is 301/302 (redirect) and then follow the new url. Taking care of protocol switches (e.g. http -> https / https -> http) would be necessary.
