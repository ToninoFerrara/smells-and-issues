jberkel/sms-backup-plus,open,unknown.person & restore question,[],"I possibly have two issues, though I am hoping that solving one of them might solve the other.

A number of old texts appear in my gmail sms folder as telephonenumber@unknown.person. The person is a known contact, and most texts from that same number appear correctly with the person's contact name. Correct ones appear on dates before, after, and interspersed with the ones that appear as ""unknown."" 

A few of these ""unknown"" texts are still on my phone, but most of them are not (that I think is my fault for having had a limit set in my messaging app). I would like to do two things: 1) correct the ""unknown"" to the person's name, and 2) restore the older messages to my phone. I am hoping that by restoring them to my phone, where they could see my contact list, and then backing them up again, I would be able to fix the ""unknown"" thing. 

However, I cannot seem to get Restore to see these emails. I have removed the ""SMS"" label from my tens of thousands of other backed up messages and left only the 102 from ""unknown"" with the SMS label and then set Restore to ""all"" (yes, ""restore sms"" is checked). But when I run Restore, it says ""successfully restored 0 items (0 dups)."" 

Update: I just received three new texts. They got labeled SMS. I ran backup. Worked great. Then I ran restore. And got ""successfully restored 0 items (3 dups)."" Which is also accurate. Yay. So the function seems to be, well, functioning, except that it won't see the SMS backups from ""unknown."" Can you help?

Note: I also tried starring all the backups from unknown and setting ""restore"" to ""starred items only"" but got the same ""successfully restored 0 items (0 dups."" Then I tried adding a new label to these backups and changing the SMS Backup+ label for backup to that new label. Nope, didn't help.

### Expected Behaviour 
Automated backups should run on the schedule selected, and after X time has passed when receiving a text.  3rd party app calls like Tasker should execute SMS Backup when the plugin is called.  *Manual backups work without issue

### Actual behaviour
When the schedule is enabled backups should be performed after the elapsed time (30 min) and after the elapsed time of a text message being received.  Also, when Tasker is used to call the 3rd party plugin to run backup, it should execute.  If manual backup is performed it works without issue.

In the log this error is often seen when calling from Tasker:
Backup requested (3rd party)
08-31 11:54 Backup skipped, no connectivity



### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
Does not work on Samsung S7 or S9 Note.  Set and enable scheduled backups, send texts to the phone from another device.  Wait for the period of time to elapse that should have triggered backups (two hours to test the 30 min schedule for example).

Also, what is this thing about requiring ""email account with IMAP enabled?""
Am only using the Google Web Client on my PC.
If you're talking about settings for the Android gmail app on the device, there is no configuration for IMAP vs POP but the behavior suggests it's POP. In any case, shouldn't your app be configured to send to an SMTP server or are you really integrating with an IMAP mail client?
If this is the real problem (requires an IMAP email client), shouldn't your app error when it can't connect to the required email client?

### Expected behaviour
Backup SMS messages.

### Actual behaviour
When email accounts are checked after completed backup, no messages have been received in Gmail accounts. Have tested against 3 gmail accounts I own, The total messages number over 2200, but have limited to 200 messages in Advanced settings (attached log file is this setting). Interesting your FAQ says gmail limit may be only 100 messages but assume your 200 message setting should work.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,open,SMS Backup+ assumes 'INBOX' at the root of the IMAP directory tree but email account may have been set otherwise,"[Label(name=""backup"")]","
### Expected behaviour

Operational (manual or automatic) 'save' function

### Actual behaviour

**""Missing required argument to List [...] Command: LIST (SPECIAL USE)"""" ""INBOX/*""; response: #3# [BAD, Missing required argument to List])**

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

I suspect the origin of the problem comes from the fact that my IMAP account (at Orange.fr) is not (cannot be) configured to start with INBOX/
It would be useful to be able to modify this assumption from within SMS Backup+

For my problem in particular, I have re-installed, uninstalled this app, changed the titles of the IMAP folder, and ran this so many times that there are duplicates of many threads, my most critical problem is that 1 number, a verizon number, stopped recording the incoming texts as of November, and they are now-mysteriously oddly gone from my phone as well---.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,open,Self-signed certificates: Support Trust on first use,"[Label(name=""feature-request""), Label(name=""security"")]","**Background**
There was some discussion in #839, on how to avoid unnoticed man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) for connections using self-signed certificates. One suggested solution is documented in #875. Another suggestion was ""trust on first use"" (TOFU).

**User Story**
As user syncing to a server using a self signed cert, I like to get notified if the cert changes, to avoid unnoticed MITM.

**Acceptance criteria**
* SMS Backup+ shows a warning when connecting to a server which uses a certificate not signed by a trusted CA
* The user can chose to trust this cert or abort the connection
* The warning contains the necessary information (fingerprint of cert, server name, ...) to allow for an informed decision.  
* Further connections to the same server succeed silently, if the cert was trusted
* If the cert changes to a cert which is not signed by a trusted CA, the same warning is shown as above.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,open,Backup or Skip all messages PROBLEM - First but not First backup HELP Needed ,"[Label(name=""awaiting response"")]","Hello All, 
I recently switched phones from a Galaxy S5 with a broken charging port to another Galaxy S5. I have been using Backup+ to back up and restore messages for years so I do have a Gmail label set with my messages as SMS. 
To transfer data this time I used Samsung Smart Switch. Everything transferred over and my new GS5 is set, I hadn't backed up my SMS to Gmail in a few days so I went to do it today and it asked:
""FIRST BACKUP"" 
""Backup or skip all messages currently stored  on this device?""
""Skip or Backup""

If I skip then it doesn't recognize ANY of my SMS currently on the phone as needing to be backed up. 
If I select ""Backup"" then it wants to backup ALL my SMS which I know 95% of them are already in Gmail... I am just trying to backup the last few days worth which should only be about 25 texts. 
So the app is recognizing none or ALL instead of just the 25 or so that are new in my phone and not yet backed up to Gmail.. 

Is there a way around this so I am not backing up loads of duplicates now? 


Before you report your issue, please search the issues page to see if it has already been reported. Also, if you'd like, you can try out the [beta version](https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus#beta).

### Expected behaviour
Backup only a few new messages from phone to SMS label in Gmail skipping messages that already exist from previous back ups in gmail


### Actual behaviour
If I select ""skip"" as in skip what's on the phone then it skips everything, but by selecting ""Backup"" it shows it wants to backup ALL my SMS instead of just what is new. 
### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
Download app, connect it to the gmail account, then select to backup, then select backup and it proceeds to backup ALL messages, even what is already in gmail.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,"Works in my CRM, but how?","[Label(name=""question""), Label(name=""stale"")]","I use Solve 360 CRM, which interfaces with G Suite.  The CRM reads emails from gmail with a label I created and have it applied to all incoming and outgoing emails. This is the same label I use to backup SMS and calls in SMS Backup+. So, all SMS and calls show up in my CRM for the correct contact.

The CRM does this based on the email address. My questions:

1. Is SMS Backup+ adding the email address to all the SMS messages and call logs at the app level? 
2. Is it matching the phone number to the email address from my contact list on the phone for calls?

Taking this one step further, I use Google Voice/Hangouts for my voicemail. I am seeing all the transcribed voicemails automatically tagged with the same label as above and showing in gmail. I think it does this because all incoming and outgoing emails are tagged with the same tag so it can show in my CRM.  Unfortunately, the email must have an actual email address tied to it, which I cannot figure out how to do in Google Hangouts. So, the transcribed voicemails are not showing up in my CRM contact.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Clean up security settings for IMAP servers,"[Label(name=""awaiting response"")]","I just stumpled on configuration options in _extended settings_ -> _IMAP server settings_ -> _Security_.  First the difference between SSL and TLS is unclear. I assume it's the very old and confusing naming scheme of Netscape and Mozilla for STARTTLS vs. IMAPS [1].
Second: the _optional_ settings could allow for silent downgrade attacks. I can't imagine any reason why there could be an IMAP server supporting STARTTLS sometimes and sometimes not.

So my suggestion is to remove the _(optional)_ settings completely and make clear what is meant by _SSL_ and _TLS_. Maybe ending up with  _None_, _SSL/TLS_ and _STARTTLS_ as options, just as Mozilla did [1].

The most interesting part is that I am still correctly bringing the entries into Gmail folders (SMS, and Call log).  It's simply the writing the event to the calendar that has stopped.  

I have performed the following diagnostics:

1.  Verified all permissions are available -
2.  Verified that connectivity to Gmail is functional (have entries from March 6 on SMS and Call log folder).
3.  Reviewed what I believe are Gmail calendar settings and ensured that there is nothing from preventing the writing of entries.
4.  Allowed automatic events from Gmail as well.

=?ISO-8859-1?Q?xxxx=A0xxx=A0xxx?= (x denotes the contact phone number)

This happens with only about 3 of my contacts.  I don't think country codes matter as other conversations that are kept together without any problem have me sending an SMS without the country code and receiving an SMS from that same contact with the country code.  Is there a reason this would happen?

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,open,Filter out selected sender numbers in Call log backup,"[Label(name=""call log""), Label(name=""feature-request"")]","I'd like to be able to create a list of numbers SMS Backup+ would not backup messages from.

Why?

More and more companies send SMS messages to deliver one-time passwords and some of them choose not to use flash SMS (I don't know why), so the sensitive info stores with other regular SMSes. SMS Backup+ then relays them into user's Gmail, so the confidence that only authorized user who is in possession of the SIM card can log-in is broken.

I'm aware that we can set SMS Backup+ to only backup messages from a specific group, but it could be very hard to maintain a group of all senders minus the few that pose the security risk. Plus the attacker who already cracked into user's Gmail can modify such Google Contacts Group to contain the number he's interested in without user's knowledge.

I know two factor authentication enabled on user's Google Account would mitigate this scenario to some extent, but then there are apps that can access user's Gmail and someone can crack into these etc. If we could prevent this sensitive info to ever reach Gmail, it would be a huge plus, IMHO. 
TIA -- and thank you for such a wonderful app.

Is there any way to force the MMS backup to happen, even though the app believes that all items are backed up, so that it can download any missing files?

I'm brand new here so please forgive my [technical] ignorance or carelessness. I've used SMS Backup+ successfully in the past to transfer text from my HTC Evo 4G over to my HTC One M8 HK on Sprint network. My M8 was softbricked recently one day out of the blue while charging. I had to reset it by updating a different rom and flash the update via my laptop. Prior to that, I had no idea how any of that works. Since getting it back up, it has been working fine, but my SMS Backup+ is not able to restore my text messages properly. I have all my text messages backed up to Gmail and I can see ""SMS"" folder in my Gmail account and all my text, past and current are there, but the SMS app will not restore all of them. I have done this 3 times and it takes a long time to backup each time (about 6 hours or more) since I have over 46K+ messages. After the third time, I was more careful to see what happens and at the end right after it read through all 46K+ messages, it says something like (39,238 dups). I looked up what that could mean and it says that the app assumed that I have that many text on my phone as duplicates already so it didn't restore those, while only the older text messages got restored on my phone. But I do not have those messages on my phone. At the same time, my Google sync is having issue with syncing my [Google] Task app as well, so I am not sure if that is related to what is going on my the SMS Backup. I could really use some guidance on how to fix this.

Here are the software I'm running on:

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,open,Callog Backup duplicates,"[Label(name=""backup""), Label(name=""call log"")]","The duplicate check process when taking backups appears a bit fragile.  In my ""Call Log"" folder (not to gmail, to my own IMAP server, if that makes a difference), I have the same call being backed up with subject line of ""Call with Foo Bar"", ""Samtal med Foo Bar"" (in Swedish, my normal system language), and ""Samtal med 0123456789"" (phone# of Foo Bar).  Would it be possible for the app to be a bit smarter about this?

I assume my usage scenario is relevant: I re-install my phone once in a while, and rely on SMS Backup+ to restore the SMS/Call Logs from the earlier phone, and then set it up to perform backups going forward.  I assume the problem happens during the initial restore and initial backup situation.

Either the duplicate check should be based on a stable property (Message-Id?) or it should recognize all Subject lines, or something.  I don't really know how the logic works, so it is difficult to propose a solution.

MMS messages haven't been showing up in ""Sent Mail"" since 2014-05-24, but that's because the To and From fields are all messed up. See issue #390.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Improve restore experience,[],"I have upgraded to Android M yesterday and had quite a few problems with restoring of my 15000+ messages (not related to Android version).

I think the restore experience can be improved by default so that more people will get it working as expected.

Reading the code I realized that messages are restored in reverse order: latest first. I assumed that the order is oldest first and that's why kept the number of restored messages to 'All' in settings. It seems that changing a couple of strings can fix that wrong assumption.

Restoring a lot of messages by default fails after at least 30 minutes with e.g. timeout of IMAP server. Most people probably will be ok with that if the latest a few thousand messages would be restored, but due to failure the restored messages are not visible (threads not updated). I propose to change the default restored count to 500 so that most people will not wait for 30 min but get at least 500 latest messages back pretty quickly. In addition, RestoreTask will now attempt to still call updateAllThreads() even in case of IMAP failure so that the restored messages already in sms.db will become visible.

The application has been removed from Google Play and won’t be available to users until you submit a compliant update. You can read more about intellectual property and our other policy guidelines in our help center.

While not explicitly stated it is very likely because of the fact that the current icon reuses graphics from Google's Gmail / Messages apps. However the same icon has been in use four more than four years so it's a mystery to me why they decided to take down the app now.

It'd like to use this issue as a call for proposals / discussion to decide on the next logo.

To start things off, here are two concepts by the designer of the current icon, Shimon Simon:

I suspect this [block of code](https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/blob/master/src/main/java/com/zegoggles/smssync/mail/MmsSupport.java#L91-L102) is the root of the issue.

Since Jan 12th SMS Backup+ crashes when I try to manually backup or when I restart my phone and the SMS Backup+ service gets started (which triggers an automatic backup, I assume).

I'm using a regular IMAP server, not a GMail account for my backup. It worked for over 6 months with SMS Backup+, so I think that's not the problem.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Contacts disappearing due to @unknown.email syntax,[],"Many of my contacts have ""disappeared"" from my address book, and I just realized that it might be due to SMS Backup+. It looks like certain contacts in Gmail have split from their phone numbers because the phone numbers have been stored using the syntax ""number@unknown.email""

As an example, I've had James as a contact in my phone for a long time. James is no longer coming up in my phone's directory when I search for his name. When I check old texts from him that were backed up by SMS Backup+, they only use his email address and look like this in Gmail:

Subject: SMS from james@gmail.com

His contact no longer has his phone number in my Gmail contacts. On the texts from him stored in my phone, it comes up like this:
From: 8025550000

When I view that contact, the email address is stored as 8025550000@unknown.email

Essentially, they are viewed as two different contacts. It looks like this has happened with over 100 contacts in my phone, and I only noticed it in the last two weeks.

I have an HTC One, Android version 4.4.3. Not sure if this is an app problem, a Gmail problem, a phone problem, or some combination thereof.

This time, I backed up my messages from a Samsung galaxy S2. I checked the messages on gmail and they showed up nicely. Then I tried to restore the messages on my new LG G3. The restoration was successfull but I noticed that non-english charachters (actually greek) characters do not appear correctly. When I click view original message in gmail, I notice that the sms content is exactly the same with what appears on my phone. It seems that while the browser (chrome) does the conversion correctly, the messaging app doesn't. It is definetely an encoding issue. I found that any greek character that does not have an english equivalent is represented with its utf8 code when performing the backup. While chrome does the translation nicely when showing the message, the messaging app does not. Any suggestions on how to fix this issue. I tried changing the encoding in the messages app but it didn't work. I also tried using hangouts to display the message but the issue is still there. Is the fact that not all characters are transformed to unicode when doing the backup the problem?

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Manual backup no longer works after latest update,[],"I have been using this app for many months and for the most part is has done exactly what it is supposed to do. However, after the last update offered on Google Play, the manual backup no longer works. Each time I try to backup, I receive the ""Error during backup/restore: IO Error"" after the ""calculating..."" stage. 

The odd thing is that the Automatic backup function is still working (the opposite of other issues I have seen reported). I checked my Gmail folder and all messages prior to an automatic backup are there, I just can't backup anything manually now, which is a pain because I have to wait til the automatic backup runs to delete messages, and while it always backs up eventually, it rarely does it when it is actually scheduled to (usually within 6 hours).

The only other time I have received an IO error is when my internet connection disconnected in the middle of a backup. Any time this happened in the past, disconnecting then reconnecting the Wifi on my phone always resolved the issue and SMS Backup + continued where it left off. I have tinkered with the internet connection many times and it's still not working. I'm fairly certain it's not a connection issue. Only the manual backup function is failing.

I skimmed through the questions and did a brief search here in the issues. I'm sorry if this question has been asked before and I missed it.

I just wanted to install SMS Backup+ 1.4.8 via f-droid and was a bit surprised to find what kinds of rights I was asked to grant it (translated from german. So it's not the exact phrases you'd find on an english phone):
- change contacts
- read calendar events and confidential information
- add or change calendar events and send e-mails to guests (without the knowledge of the owner)

Given the scope of the program I don't really see why those rights are needed. Especially the last one strikes me as very intrusive.
I guess everything is cool and in order. But I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. Thx.
"
jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Restore order ,[],"I restored my sms messages and found them to be in the wrong order. From what I can see, this is due to #269, and also maybe #94. I'm not sure if they're the same thing and they've both been inactive for a while, so I've started a new issue.

To get messages in the right order on (for example) Sony phones, it looks like they have to be inserted oldest first, which conflicts with peoples' want to have newer messages available at the start of the restore, so cancelling midway gets the most recent ones restored.

To deal with this, I propose splitting the restoration process into two phases: message download and then message restore. Instead of adding messages one by one, messages should be downloaded newest first and added to a local storage. Instead of the local cache, which I see gets wiped, the messages could be saved locally using something like the k9 LocalStore. If the restore is cancelled, then the messages can be added to the real sms store as a 'tidying up' stage. The downloaded messages would be iterated through in reverse order, meaning they display correctly (hopefully) on Sony etc devices, and fulfill the newest restored first idea. Hopefully, this tidying up should be relatively quick, as the messages are already downloaded...

In #269, MarSoft describes another problem with restoring on Sony devices. If new sms messages aren't synced, then restoring older messages will bury them. I think the solution to this could be to first ensure that a backup is made if the user has allowed it. Remaining unsynced messages should then be added to the (top of the) local storage, and the sync can continue as normal. I've not looked at what duplicate detection the app does, but restoring messages one by one will allow duplicates to be deleted one by one (so crashes/cancelling doesn't trash the lot) and reinserted.

After all this, the workaround linked to in #94 could be considered in necessary. There might also be the possibility of reducing overhead by calling ImapStore's fetch with more than one message at a time, as messages would no longer be processed individually at the download stage.

I checked and made sure that in the advanced options there wasn't anything selected limiting my texts; i.e. ""all"" was selected for how many to back up instead of, say, 100. It's backing up new SMS as they come in just fine, but the oldest messages are ignored.

I need all of my texts backed up so I can print some of them out for court.

This is also something I noticed but not important. I don't think a single MMS was backed up since I didn't see a paperclip icon next to any of the conversation threads.

My phone is a HTC Droid something, running Ice Cream Sandwich. I'm sorry I can't be more specific than that. It's from Verizon if it helps.

With the new Hangouts its possible to make voice calls without using the standard dialer in Android.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Group MMS Conversations aren't properly threaded in GMail,[],"Hello! This app has been a lifesaver for me - it's the only thing I've found that can both backup and allow me to view backups of my sms and mms messages. I'm fairly pleased with how it works at present, but I have been frustrated by one thing - group mms messages aren't stored properly in gmail conversations. Instead, they are split at random into snippets of conversations in multiple threads with each individual participant, which makes them quite hard to read and decipher. As I use group messaging extensively to complete projects for both work and school, this is quite inconvenient for me, and I imagine many others.

I did search your issues history and about a year ago a topic (issue #279) came up about this, though it was worded more about the title of each conversation rather than how the messages are actually stored in gmail. At the time you refused to work on it - is this still the case?

Thanks for your great work on this app and I wish you luck in the future.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Feature Request: Allow user to manually set 'skip' date,[],"When installing SMS Backup+ a second time after wiping a phone or changing phones, you are given the option to 'skip' the backup, so as to prevent messages being backed up twice.

This generally works, but I am currently in the situation where this worked for SMS but not for WhatsApp. As such, when I attempt to do a backup now, while only the few new SMS messages will be backed up, SMS Backup+ attempts to back up every single WhatsApp message on my phone. At this point I am cancelling the backup, so as to prevent all my WhatsApp messages being duplicated on Gmail.

My suggestion for a feature would be an advanced setting to manually set the date and time cut-off value for back-ups, so as to allow the user to get around such a scenario.

If this feature was available, the problem could be solved by the following steps:
- Temporarily disable backup of SMS, but leave WhatsApp backup enabled
- Temporarily set the 'skip' date and time to the last time I properly backed up a WhatsApp message
- Perform a backup such that all WhatsApp messages not yet backed up get added to Gmail
- Set the skip date and time to the present date and time
- Re-enable SMS backup

After this point, only new messages should get backed up for both SMS and WhatsApp.

I hope you will take this suggestion into consideration.

Sms backup+ had been backing up great and with problem. 

I had a network time problem and my phone for a day where the phone thought it was Feb 12, 2014 instead of the correct Dec 27, 2013. During this time SmS backup functioned properly.  

The network time problem has been corrected, Hoevet SMS backup has stopped backing up. It thinks the last backup was on Feb 12, 2014 due to the network time error and isn't trying to back up new incoming sms.   

I tried the settings/reset and it asked me to back up everything which I ""skipped"". After that the incorrect Feb 12, 2014 timestamp odd still being shown under the last backup time at the top of the app.  I

I installed SMS Backup+ on my new Nexus 5 with Android 4.4. I don't know if the issue is because of the new OS, the device, Hangouts or that I've set it up incorrectly.

The problem I'm finding is that after a picture MMS msg that I've sent is backed up, the gmail msg puts it in a thread where the sender is myself (correct), but the recipient is ""+15556667777 <+15556667777@unknown.email>"" (incorrect). The person I've texted is my wife and she exists in my contacts, but instead of her name and number, there is no name and the phone number (15556667777) is my own. The email address attached is exactly what is shown above (+15556667777@unknown.email). It is correctly labelled as ""SMS"".

I've used this app before on my old Samsung Galaxy S and it worked perfectly fine. The MMS msgs would have the correct recipients and be in the same thread as the regular SMS msgs with the same person.

For MMS msgs I receive, they are backed up properly with the correct sender and recipient, plus exist in the proper threads with the other SMS msgs. Both sent and received SMS msgs are backed up properly.

Is there a setting I missed or is this a bug?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jason

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,[NOT A PULL REQUEST] Request SMS Backup+ to be the default SMS package before restoring,[],"Request SMS Backup+ to be set as the default SMS package before restoring.

**THIS PATCH HAS A NUMBER OF TODOS AND SHOULD NOT LAND AS IS.**

Starting with Android KitKat, only the default SMS package is allowed to
write to the SMS provider. Because SMS Backup+ did not register for the
ComposeSmsActivity activity or the receivers at all, it could not be set
as such, rendering the restore functionality useless in KitKat.

This patch somewhat hacks the necessary functionality in the application to
make it possible to import SMS messages again. It adds the necessary
receivers and activity to the AndroidManifest.xml file (but does not become
the default SMS app by default) and adds some logic to the restore flow:
- When starting the restore, request to become the default SMS package
    if the user is running KitKat or higher and it's not already.
- If the default SMS activity has changed, add this as an intent with
    which we're launching the service.
- In the SmsRestoreService, abort restoring if we're not able to write
    to the SMS provider. A better message should be added here.
- After the restore finished, check if the previous-sms-provider intent
    extra has been set. If so, ask the user to restore to that activity.

It's important to reset the default SMS provider to something that's not
SMS Backup+, because otherwise incoming messages will disappear in a black
hole. There's a lot of user interaction involved here, but I'm not sure if
there's a good way around that.

This patch is not ready to land, but I hope it gives you a good idea about
what's needed to fix restore for Android KitKat and higher. It allowed me
to import my SMS messages just fine :-). Thanks for the great app!

Can you optionally format the messages this way?

The date is in the gmail message header, so you already have it. 
The name of the sender (Green90) is in the subject and also in the message header, 
so you have it too. 
I am not sure if you can get  the real phone number of the sender.
On the phone itself if I push the 'call' button while viewing SMS it starts calling, so the phone definitely knows the real number.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Samsung Galaxy S4 - won't back up any items,[],"Hello,

I used to use this app happily enough on the HTC Legend, One S and One X, but I cannot seem to get it to work on the GS4. Instead of backing anything up, it saysit has backed up 0/however many items (see attached picture). It will not back up SMS messages or WhatsApp conversations to Gmail as it won't get past the screen shown. SMS Backup, the one that just creates text files (?) on the phone, does work, however.

I've un/reinstalled a couple of times, and am running version 1.5.5; I've tried it with and without auto backup; I've tried it on wifi and on mobile data; none of these things have made a difference.

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated as I love the app and cannot fathom how to solve this issue!

For example, an incoming text message is converted to an email From:""Name (phone)"" phone@unknown.email, To: myobscureaccount@gmail.com. I'd like to be able to configure it so the To address is ""Martin"" mynormalemailaddress@gmail.com, or at least just configure the name.

EDIT _____
I attempted to sync over my 4G network and it has now synced all of my texts from GMAIL to my phone again, however they are not in the correct order, meaning instead of showing the most recent at the bottom like a normal conversation it shows the oldest at the bottom.  Is there a setting to fix that?

I have read FAQ, and I have tried all of the following, none of them solved my problem.
- Switched to using plaintext authentication with an app-specific password
- Reauthorized SMS Backup+ from Google Account
- Tried to backup over VPN in case my connection is blocked 
- Cleared data of SMS Backup+
- Uninstall/reinstall
- Unchecked/checked SMS label visibility in Gmail IMAP, checked if its all uppercase and still available

My SMS is now stacking up in my inbox, please help me so I can continue backing up.

Thanks.

This is especially useful when traveling and using multiple phones or SIM cards.

Options:
- preferred approach would be to add phone number (or user-defined phone-id string) into To: field, i.e.
  To: +12223334444 username@domain.com
- alternatively we could add phone number (or user-defined phone-id string) to Subject: field, i.e. 
  Subject: Call with 1-222-555-1212 (to: +12223334444)
  Subject: SMS with 24341 (received by +12223334444)

Obviously addition of this extra field should be made optional.

But since I have reset the app, when I do try to backup the messages... it asks me if I want to BACKUP or SKIP the messages and I rather just have some of my old messages backed up again than to not have to them backed up onto my Gmail.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,"sms backup + dates, time, etc",[],"Hello, I like you apps and I am using it on my Android Samsung Galaxy S.
I have some issues regarding the dates, times when I download the messages to Outlook.
The date and times of the backuped SMSs and Call logs on viewing them through Google.com seems OK, but when I download them to my Outlook, the dates are marked by the time they were produced by your program. As I were digging the problem I found out that the inbox in Outlook show the date and time of the receivment and that I should make another column with the sent date. But a bit of the problem is stil there, because if I put the outgooing messages to the sent items (with the column sent date on) they are ordered well, but the problem remains woth the SMSs that I received and should stay in my Inbox folder.

It is not a big issue, but I would recommend you that under setting of your program you add the possibility of adding to the body of the message the date and time of the posting SMS and the type of SMS (outgooing, incoming).

The incoming mail would bi in this case:

from: Name and Surname of the sender
to: Name and Surname of the recipient (option: number)
subject: (outgoing/incoming) SMS (to or from) name surname (option number)
body:
outgoing / incoming SMS
date, time
body of SMS

I added the BouncyCastle jar file from here: http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html

Other than that I love the app.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,initial backup of mms / call log for sms backup users,[],"One thing that would be nice, for users that are upgrading from SMS Backup to SMS Backup+: an initial backup of just the MMS messages and possibly call log, skipping SMS entirely.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,3G only backup option,[],"```
There's already an option for wifi only, could you also add an option for 3G only
to SMS Backup+? The app seems to take a long time to login and backup over
GPRS, which in my experience causes a lot of battery drain.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Encryption of data,[],"I'm currently working on a feature to encrypt the data backed up. See https://github.com/doits/sms-backup-plus

This will use the new APG-AIDL-Interface (I'm working on, too... see https://code.google.com/p/android-privacy-guard/issues/detail?id=71, there's also a working branch apg_service).

If you have any comments on my fork, say so. Remember, it is mostly unfinished/untested and only a proof of concept is working for now (encrypting the body of any msg).

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Mark only missed calls as unread,[],"This is partially related to https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/issues/#issue/103

It would be very useful if SMSBackup+ could mark all calls as read, except for missed calls. This would enable the users to see on their gmail page if they missed a call, even if they for example forgot their phone somewhere.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,MMS backed-up in a different thread in GMail,[],"I haven't sent an MMS in a while, but I sent two picture MMS today, and I noticed that when these two MMS were backed up to GMail, they got put in a separate thread in GMail rather than in the same thread as all the SMS.  I'm not sure if this was an intentional change or not, but SMS and MMS used to be in the same thread.  Also, I'm not sure if this problem is the same with received MMS as well, as I haven't gotten any lately.

I'm using the Droid Incredible.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Unable to back up previous messages.,[],"I browsed the FAQ and explored other issues but wasn't able to find an answer. I hope I'm not readressing a previous issue that's already be resolved.
I have a thread about 900 messages long. I'm trying to back up the entire thread but It appears I'm only able to back up the messages that have been created after installation. All messages preceding installation don't get backed up. I have an HTC evo. Is there something I need to adjust in my settings to get those messages backed up?
I apologize again if I've simply overlooked the solution.
Thank you.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,gets stuck on mms read receipts,[],"This is not a big deal, but I want to help you because I noticed this little idiosyncrasy:

When I have MMS read receipts turned on, I think the receipts arrive and are stored as MMS messages, and SMS Backup+ can't back up those particular messages.

When I try to back up MMS messages, it gets stuck on an MMS message with a read receipt, and it won't continue past that point. It still backs up the original MMS (picture, video, etc), but it fails when it tries to back up the receipt (which is usually next in chronological order).  If I delete the MMS with the read receipt, the backup finishes successfully.

To fix this problem, I turned off MMS read receipts in my messaging settings, deleted the existing MMS messages with read receipts, and then sent some new MMS messages. After that, the next backup completed successfully.

I think the permanent solution is to skip MMS read receipts when backing up the MMS messages.  However, if no one else is having this problem, then I'm perfectly happy just leaving MMS read receipts off because then the MMS backup works as expected.

First of all, let me say this is a GREAT app.  Thanks for all your hard work on it!

This is a minor issue, but for the GMail app for Android (I use the Droid Incredible), the dates and times shown for the backed-up messages are the dates and times for when the messages were backed up to GMail, but not the actual dates and times that the original text message was sent.

There is a similar problem with the web-based GMail.  In the inbox view, the dates on the very right are the dates when the latest text message of each thread was last backed up.  However, clicking into the message thread, each individual message does show the correct date and time for the individual text message.

I'm not sure if this problem lies with how GMail deals with IMAP, or if this problem is resolvable from your end, but I just thought I'd ask.

Thanks again!

First off, thanks for your additions to sms backup. I love the app.

I was having a few problems that I think I've fixed:
- Contacts were failing lookup entirely (not even a name was returned even when it was available). I fixed this by using the ContactsContract API introduced in api level 5, and in particular use the ""highly optimized"" query by phone number. I assume the optimization is that it converts things to a canonical representation before lookup.
- Fixed a bug with looking up your own email address. Now uses the OAuth entry rather than the (unavailable) hardcoded username.

Sorry if this is the wrong place, but I thought the answer might help others too.

I have a bunch of old mmssms.db files that I'd like to merge all together (too bad I wasn't running your app sooner).

I thought of a few ways to do this and would love your input:

1) Simply merge the sms table (all fields except _id) into one database.  Question: will Android automatically recreate all the indexes, e.g. thread table, etc?

2) I guess in theory I could keep on copying the file across, reboot, run your app, with all files?

3) I could write my own app (on my PC) to also sync via IMAP all the sms's using the same format as your app, and let them sync back to my phone.

I'd love to hear what you think is best, since I'm sure you know the messaging system quite well by now :)

Would be pretty awesome if a contact group could be specified and only
SMSes to/from those contacts were backed up. That way I could create an
""SMS Backup"" group, add the appropriate contacts to it, and back up SMSes
from my family but not backup notifications from my Carrier or boss.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Spaces in telephone number generates invalid email address,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","http://code.google.com/p/android-sms/issues/detail?id=70

It is sometimes the case that phone numbers have spaces or other characters
in them (these may have been added manually or when syncing from another
address book). This does not work properly when the android-sms app
generates the email address for a number.
e.g. phone number ""+61 412345678"" (note the space after +61). The app
generates the following line in the email source:

From: ""Name Of Person"" <+61 412345678@unknown.email>

This does not work properly in gmail, and spaces in email addresses are
invalid anyway.
The same bug would occur for the To:.

Can you add some code to simply replace spaces and any other invalid email
address characters in a phone number with, e.g. underscores (_), when
generating the email address from/to line.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,"""From"" and ""To"" email metadata with real phone number",[],"Can we have ""From"" and ""To"" with exact phone number rather than replaced email address as in current version?

There is a scenario in which a contact has more than a phone number, and it is difficult for the app to restore sms matching correct phone number.

In another scenario, a contact change email address, consequently make it difficult to restore sms based on email address.

However, the app is great. Love it!

This app is great, however the partial wake usage is draining my battery
quicker than expected. Could this be looked into as I think it may be a bug.

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Only Restore Last X Amount Of Messages,"[Label(name=""feature-request"")]","I am not sure if this feature request is similar to the ""Deleted messages (on phone) are restored as well"". I have my phone set up to delete messages after a conversation reaches 200 txts. However when I restore the messages all 10,000 of my texts are restored. Would it be possible to have the program only restore the last X amount of messages (in my case 200) instead of all of them (in my case 10,000)

Also I just wanted to thank you for this program, it has been invaluable in helping me get my messages back!

jberkel/sms-backup-plus,closed,Deleted messages (on phone) are restored as well,[],"When running a restore ALL messages with the corresponding label (in my case the default SMS) are restored onto the device. Even when they have been previously deleted on the phone.

The optimal solution in my eyes would be something like this:
When a SMS is deleted on the phone add a deleted label to the backed up SMS in Gmail.
On restore on the messages without the deleted filter would be restored.

A first step could be that a label could be specified that is then used to filter out the messages. This label had to be applied manually in gmail.

In general this issue arises since I pretty much never deleted any messages. Often they contain business relevant information, even though I do not have to access that information every day.
