My device (a Gemini PDA) works only in landscape mode, and Flym can show only two story titles at once.  If the site logo were shrunk, the font size reduced a little, and/or the vertical spacing reduced, it could probably fit many more, which would be much more useful.

(I guess this could either be a user option, or automatic based on the screen height.)

Flym seems to handle landscape mode very well, other than this issue.  (I open stories in my browser, so I can't speak about how it displays story bodies.)

Finally, some praise: Flym is exactly what I want from a news reader!  I'd given up finding one that didn't require accounts and subscriptions, store my feeds on some company's servers, or try to turn news reading into a poor social network…  So many thanks for it!"

* The mark all as read button
* The ""more"" and ""expand"" buttons for groups in the feed menu

TalkBack is able to read out element IDs in the latest version which makes many apps more accessible, but this function is not activated by default. Therefore propper labeling is always the better solution. 

Furthermore the feed reordering function doesn't seem to be accessible for TalkBack users. At least I was not able to find out how to assign a feed to a group or move feeds between groups. How is this done visually? Maybe there is a gesture which talkback isn't able to reproduce.

<p>近日，机器之心采访了明略数据首席科学家、科学院院长吴信东教授，吴教授一直专注于知识工程方面的研究，并从专家系统到大数据时代经历了技术的变迁与发展。在本文中，我们将着重介绍专家系统及大数据环境下的知识工程，它们的共性是从专家或数据中提取知识，并用于进一步的推理与预测。吴信东教授在10月15到16号的AIIA人工智能开发者大会将会更详细地介绍大数据知识工程。</p><p><img src=""https://image.jiqizhixin.com/uploads/editor/d49063d2-8a4e-48b9-82c9-f54c7829eda9/1539339067777.jpeg"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" style=""width: 700%;""></p><p>吴信东教授是国家“千人计划”特聘专家、长江学者、IEEE &amp; AAAS Fellow，他早期关注于专家系统，也就是知识工程的应用实践。而随着机器学习与大数据的流行，他领导的科技部重点研发项目BigKE将“大数据”引入了“大知识”。整体而言，大数据知识工程（BigKE）也就是从多种异构数据源抽取碎片化的知识，并将这些知识融合为整体以提供进一步的知识服务。</p><h3>专家系统</h3><p>专家系统，即从领域专家获取知识，并将这种知识迁移到计算机系统以自动实现某些专家能力求解的功能。对于基于专家系统的知识工程，其可以定义成为对应用问题求解所进行的知识的获取、表达和推理。它主要包含三阶段，首先知识的获取就需要与领域专家交流，并获取专家在该领域解决特定问题的知识。其次需要将获取的知识表达出来，这一般是形式化的表达，例如用逻辑表示和知识图谱表示等。最后需要基于这种表示对问题进行求解，也就是进行知识推理。</p><p><img src=""https://image.jiqizhixin.com/uploads/editor/060b9310-c671-47ff-b4fc-89c641ab8b90/1539339067828.jpeg"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" style=""width: 700%;""></p><p>吴信东教授表示目前其实还有很多解决方案在实践中会使用专家系统，只不过它会作为大系统的组成部分，其它如计算机视觉、深度学习和知识图谱等组成部分可能更加引人注意。此外，专家系统完成的任务相对于端到端的方法会更宽广。例如深度方法更擅长识别和分类等任务，它关注非常精细的决策。而专家系统会尝试解决整个领域需要专业知识的决策，它可能会涉及多种任务。</p><p>正如吴教授所说，专家知识在各种系统都充当着非常重要的作用，不论是针对特定领域问题还是大数据。例如对于机器学习来说，很多时候先验知识都是一种专家知识，而卷积神经网络等新型模型同样也应用了专家知识，因为我们假设了图像等二维数据只有在局部才是相互影响的。</p><p>但是纯粹的专家系统却有很多局限性，它无法兼容当前的大数据环境。首先大数据具有三大显著特点，即海量数据、数据质量参差不齐、个性化属性，这些都是传统专家系统无法解决的，因此也就有了吴教授负责的国家重点研发计划重点专项项目----大数据知识工程（BigKE）。</p><h2>大数据知识工程</h2><p>在大数据时代， 如何利用知识工程的思想和方法获取、表示、推理和解释大数据，并将挖掘出的知识形成解决问题的大知识系统，这就是大数据知识工程（BigKE）最希望完成的目标。</p><p>相比于传统专家系统，基于大数据的大知识系统更关注提取各种数据中的碎片化知识，并与领域的专家知识相结合而构建整个系统。大数据知识工程降低了对专家知识的依赖性，并希望从碎片化的信息中抽取群智知识。吴信东教授表示，从整体而言，BigKE可以分为三阶段，即多源异构数据中的碎片化知识建模、从局部知识到全局知识的碎片化知识融合、个性化知识导航。</p><p><img src=""https://image.jiqizhixin.com/uploads/editor/2926adb0-c140-4ea7-a374-1bfba34301e0/1539339067885.jpeg"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" style=""width: 700%;""></p><p>包含三阶段的BigKE框架，第一阶段通过在线学习对碎片化知识进行建模，第二阶段实现非线性知识融合，第三阶段按需求提供知识服务。</p><h3>碎片化知识建模</h3><p>BigKE首先会采用合适的模型对各种数据类型进行建模，相当于从非结构化数据中抽取结构化的知识。这一建模过程主要会采用在线学习的模式，即持续不断地一点点学习不同的知识碎片。此外，从多种数据源中抽取的碎片化知识对评估数据的可靠性和数据质量有着重要的作用。如上所示，BigKE会同时考虑数据流与特征流，而对流数据的处理需要选择动态模型来刻画数据特征，因此动态的知识提取是非常重要的方面。</p><p>在线学习继续向后输出具有语义信息的特征，而数据的可靠性同样也会在后面得以评估。之所以需要评估，主要是因为我们无法对所有数据进行建模，而且不同数据来源有着良莠不齐的质量。因此我们可以对数据来源进行排序和评价，获得数据的精确度和可靠性，并在数据筛选时选择较高质量的数据。因此相比于一般的在线学习，关注特征流的在线学习不仅关注数据处理顺序，同时关注更有效和优质的特征空间。</p><p>吴教授表示对知识建模的在线学习可以是各种优秀的机器学习或深度学习模型。例如我们希望从文本中抽取出主体的属性，那么就能使用基于深度学习的命名实体识别抽取知识，而当我们希望从图像中抽取出主要物体，那么又可以使用卷积神经网络等方法抽取知识。这里不同类型的数据会有合适的方法进行处理，并抽取出我们想要的知识。</p><h3>非线性知识融合</h3><p>在从不同的数据源抽取必要的知识后，如何融合这些不同方面的知识就显得非常重要。为了将离散的局部知识融合为全局知识，BigKE采用知识图谱表示碎片化知识，其中局部知识可以表示为完整知识图谱的一个子图。</p><p>吴教授说：“知识图谱的整体概念比较简单，它主要包含两部分。首先第一部分是节点，节点一般涉及到概念，比如人、物体和事件等，其次是连接，它会连接不同的概念。所以从本质上来说，任何能以概念及概念间的连接来表达的问题都能视为知识图谱。”此外在知识图谱中，连接会分为显性连接和隐性连接，显性连接可以是层次关系或亲友关系等，而隐性连接为两个概念没有直接关系，但计算相似度等手段可以建立新的隐性关系。在知识图谱里加上这些非线性属性以后，能够将局部知识与全局知识更好地聚合在一起，并实现更进一步的知识推理。</p><p>BigKE采用知识图谱表示和融合局部知识有非常多的优势，首先来自各种数据源的知识有独特的属性，它们间的关系是复杂和演化的，因此传统的线性融合方法无法反映出局部知识之间的联系。而知识图谱为局部知识和全局知识提供了统一的表示形式，它们的概念都能表示成节点，而各种关系都能表示成连接。其次，知识图谱节点之间的路径可以视为不同知识片段之间的可能关联，这为个性化服务的实现提供了可能。</p><h3>知识推理</h3><p>BigKE的目标是根据用户需求提供服务，也就是根据已搭建的知识图谱进行知识推理。对于前面搭建的知识图谱，其节点和边分别对应于知识单元和知识之间的语义关联，而提供知识服务可以视为搜索两点之间的最佳路径。此外，吴教授表示知识推理同样可以实现个性化的推荐，并为个性化的查询提供精确的导航服务。因此针对个性化查询，BigKE会在知识图谱直接进行推断，从而预测用户可能的行为。吴信东教授将于10月15到16号在苏州国际博览中心举办的AIIA人工智能者开发大会详细地介绍大数据知识工程。</p><p>报名链接：http://www.huodongxing.com/event/3458284296300</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""https://image.jiqizhixin.com/uploads/editor/aa2c9339-db14-4d98-8b59-dbfeabb262a3/1539339067957.jpeg"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" style=""width: 700%;""></p>

With this change, the function of keepDate is restricted to the deletion of old items and the filtering is based on what was retrieved previously. 

- Feeds, that do not have a pubDate would be treated as they're now (no filtering). 
- I see three possibilities: Calculating the newest pubDate while it is retrieved and storing it with an update (probably the best approach but more work), a trigger when an item is stored (I see some overhead), a select max (previous items could have been deleted because of keepDate).

The app seems to crash every once in awhile. Sometimes on start, sometimes I start to scroll down and it crashes when it gets to a certain article. It will also crash when viewing the affected article itself. This was something I've dealt with from time to time over the past few years but usually I just wait till need feeds load and push the article down. I have a hunch its encountering it when trying to load large resources (PDF, MP4...).  It may also have to do with having fetching the full text

This usually happens with hacker-news or lobsters links so sometimes its hard to find the exact article thats causing the crash. I'll add more details when I can find the exact article its crashing on

While reading an article, frequently I try to scroll down and instead get locked into left-right motion.

Since I am picky about what I read, I don't imagine myself ever using this to get to another article. The option to disable it would just neatly eliminate accidents.

Thanks again!"
HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,"Option to disable ""read/unread""",[],"Hello!

Would it be too much of an inconvenience to have the option to just disable all unread tracking?

I know I'm in the minority here, but I personally consider tracking read status for RSS feeds to be more harmful than it is good. Social media has the right idea about not marking tweets/posts as read. In a high-volume environment, it does nothing but add a mental strain and an element of unnecessary micromanagement. I know when I've read something by virtue of having read it.

If I were the developer, I would just get rid of it 😉; despite the fact that the app description clearly says you have no interest in implementing syncing, I already see a feature request for syncing by owncloud.

I'm really happy that I've found the Flym project and I'm amazed by the progress made within the last week :)

Though, I've found a bug in the readability view somehow: Subscribing the speedweek.com formula one feed (https://www.speedweek.com/rss/rss_formel-1.xml), the entries load correctly as well as the short descriptions. But as soon as I click on the readability icon at the top of Flym (second icon from the right, the 4-lined icon) it will only display the general links of the website, but no content/text of the actual article that should be displayed. This happened with all versions of flym 2 that I tried out since last week.

HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,privacy protection (,[],"Hi everyone,
I really like Flym and I use it every day. 
But there is one thing I would like to have added after all of these things published about secret services like the NSA. Please add a privacy feature that asks during the first start to be activated or not.

It shall stop reloading any data like icons of texts or reload data like implemented youtube videos within rss entries when opening them.

I do not want any company like youtube or any secret service to know when I am reading an article with any pictures or youtube clips. Best would be to always download all icons in the start screen immediately and also download all pictures within the posts immediately when refreshing and only leave a link to implemented youtube-files. 

The second nice thing about this feature would be that pictures of icons of the articles would not be loaded anymore and no further mobile data  is needed.
I know that a similar issue exists but my focus is only on privacy protection.

Best regards
Fox

Elaboration:
In Serbian Cyrillic translations we simply transcribe a name, so that it is written as we pronounce it.

It is common to leave the original name (untranscribed) as well, but only in first occurence.

HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,[bug] Multiple issues attempting to import from OPML from different sources,[],"Steps to reproduce:
- Open feeds list, select vertical ""..."", pick ""Import from OPML""
- New screen opens with a variety of sources: Recent, Drive, Downloads, ""Select file or directory...""
- Select vertical ""..."", pick settings, tick ""Display advanced devices""
- ""Internal storage"" added to list of sources
- Attempt to select file from each

What should happen:
- If OPML file is in that location, should appear and be selectable

What happens instead:
- Recent - nothing appears, cannot test
- Drive - OPML file in Drive root appears, but is grey and does not respond to selection (other non-OPML files behave the same way)
- Downloads - OPML file in Downloads folder does not appear (no files appear)
- Internal storage - OPML file in Downloads folder is visible, but is grey and does not respond to selection (other non-OPML files behave the same way)
- ""Select file or directory"" - error occurs on selection (""Unfortunately Documents has stopped"") [1] - however, ""Select file (SD-root)"" file dialog still appears after error dismissed - after some experimentation I discovered that the folder presented is the parent of the Downloads folder (usually contains only a dotfile) - moving the OPML file here and selecting it works

Since then I have noticed FeedEx_auto_backup.opml and FeedEx_14...opml appearing in the same location.

Workaround:
- Place OPML file in parent of Downloads folder and use the ""Select file or directory"" source.

[1] This is probably unrelated. The source has an Avast Antivirus logo, and I'm guessing that Avast is somehow interfering with Documents / the file browser.

Actually, this is already implemented, but only partly. In the item-view the sorting is as I've described above. But in the item-list of the feed, items are ordered by their _title_ if the date is identical.
In other words, the order of the items in the item-list-view and the item-view are different. This means that if I click on the first element of the _item-list_, I have to ""scroll up"" to the first element in the _item-view_.

That player stops and loses its position in the audio file if I visit another app.

It would be nice to have the option to choose to either download the enclosed audio file or to open it directly. The downloaded file could then be opened with an audio player that's able to play it in the background.

That seems like a good approach to me, apart from the fact that a second refresh button seems a bit clunky. It occurred to me that the IS_READ boolean in the database could be replaced with an integer that would hold a timestamp of the moment the entry was labeled as read. The EntriesList fragment could then only hide the entries that were read before the last refreshUI() call. That way, visiting EntryView would not hide the entry from the list, but opening and closing the drawer would. The change to the code would be relatively simple, but it would alter the schema of the entries table. Of course, the problem of accidentally marking newly added entries as read would remain.

HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,Cleanup of HTML/CSS in EntryView.java,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I just pushed a FeedEx branch on GitHub with some changes to EntryView.java. 
- Style and layout definitions are completely separated from HTML and placed in the CSS. This makes the HTML simpler and the HTML generation code a bit more readable. The stylesheet also includes rules for things like 'blockquote' elements, 'ul' and 'ol' lists in order to try to lay them out in a way that is readable on small displays. 
- The 'font' elements are gone. 'Font' was deprecated in HTML several years before the first Android device ever became available. For the font size preference setting, my code uses WebView's textZoom setting instead of inserting 'font' elements into the HTML.  This makes the code a bit simpler and gets rid of a few lines of conditional HTML-generation.

The removal of blockquotes makes these feeds extremely hard to make sense of.

I just pushed my own branch where the blockquote removal is commented out. My version also has appropriate CSS rules in EntryView.java for the presentation of blockquotes. I branched from v. 1.4.1. which is a few revisions behind the current head, and I think the HTML cleanup code has changed in the meantime.

HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,Auto mark as read when scrolling through posts,[],"I replaced feedly with FeedEx as part of an attempt to shift to open-source apps wherever possible and after the newest update (navigation drawer) I'm very happy about that. Thanks!

One feature I miss that feedly has is that posts are automatically marked as read when I scroll through them (one by one when they're being scrolled up out of sight). That would be much more convenient than trying to hit the checkbox for each one and often unwillingly opening the post. You could add a switch in the options menu to de-/activate the feature.

Another problem I had was accidently sliding left/right while reading a post. It would be nice, if one was able to disable this as well.

HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,Read articles becomes unread after update,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi,

On several feeds, post I have already read becomes unread when FeedEx update the list of feeds. Here two feeds which are buggy.

http://www.debian.org/News/news

http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/users/joueurdugrenier/uploads?alt=rss&amp;v=2&amp;orderby=published&amp;client=ytapi-youtube-profile

Maybe they are specials and don't respect the standard RSS format but they worked on my previous feed reader.

I took two screenshots on my smartphone for the example. 

![screenshot_2013-09-16-07-45-05](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3806094/1147491/1f75d7f2-1ea7-11e3-93d2-1a33e7002f10.png)

The YouTube post just became unread and the post date is 15/09/2013 according to FeedEx but according to Google, the video was uploaded the 03/09/2013. I suspect a change in the RSS YouTube post, it has been modified (views number? Rating?). 

It is a very incomfortable issue for me, and I think this is not a good behavior for a feed reader.

Hope I clearly explain.

Greetings.

HoloAddict/FeedEx,closed,Potentially oversized image cache.,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi there,

After using this app for a few months, I've just noticed that my internal storage has been almost completely used. It appears this is the result of caching far too many images. I'm unsure though as the cache files aren't associated to my image viewer. There are currently ~3700 items in /storage/sdcard0/FeedEx/images. Assuming, these files are actually images (I expect they are), to prevent similar issues in the future, I'd like to suggest ways of limiting the size of the image cache.
- Add a set-able limit to the image cache (perhaps a 200MB default?)
- Many images are icons (think of ""retweet"" and ""like"" buttons) that are regularly used - especially on entries from the same site. Implementing a hash-comparison system to decide whether or not to store an image could come into play here. The process for an entry might go like this: Download article image > generate checksum > compare with checksum database > if entry already exists, discard newly downloaded image, otherwise, create a new entry. 
- You might even consider the origin of the file - if it's the same originating url, chances are you won't even need to download the file again.

Of course, I may be interpreting this incredibly and horribly incorrectly. At any rate, I love this app, it's the best RSS reader I've seen so far.
Keep up the superb work,
eages.
