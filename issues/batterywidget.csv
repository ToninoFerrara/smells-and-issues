hmrocha/batterywidget,open,Memory Leak,[],"After a double rotation of the Postcode Activity there are in heap memory 2 instances more of:

class net.tevp.postcode.Postcode @ 0x12c76800

It should not be like this because the rotations return to the same GUI state and the memory should stay in the same state as well. It could be a symptom of a bad management of the onCreate-onDestroy lifecycle. 

I have encountered this problem on an Android emulator running 7.1.1 os version.
