When I receive an apk I am not able to launch (inside TrebleShot) the app installer view by touching the apk file, other file formats launch the associated application. (tested on 3 devices, same problem)

1. share an apk from device 1 to device 2
2. on device 2 go to the file explorer tab in the app's menu.
3. locate the received apk and try to launch the installer by touching it.
4. See an empty list with title ""Open with"" and  a message ""No apps can perform this action."" in the list's body.

genonbeta/TrebleShot,open,UX improvements,"[Label(name=""help wanted""), Label(name=""pending""), Label(name=""question"")]","Hi, thanks for putting in your time on this app! FOSS file-sharing apps like TrebleShot are sorely needed, but unfortunately, as it stands, it suffers from poor UX.

The app does not inform the user that...
1. both devices have to be on the same WiFi network (for operation without a hotspot).
2. location mode needs to be 'high accuracy' or 'power saving' to successfully create a hotspot. 

Lastly, setting up TrebleShot seems overly complicated when both users are not on the same WiFi network, which I think is the most common use case. Can anything be done to simplify the process enough such that any non-geek can do it with minimum steps or guesswork, and without a helping person or documentation? Will #26 improve this?

When sending files they will be added to the `Pending transfers` and i can see below the file pending. When the file is finished it quickly change from `pending` to `task complete` and then it change quickly back to `pending` again.

If we implement this feature we can sent files to Windows phone and IOS . Trebleshot is not available for this 2 platforms so it's a great plus point. 


But what about receiving files from users those who don't have trebleshot installed on their phones or how Windows Phone and IOS users sent files to trebleshot user? Then I found this app called ""fast file transfer"" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.fastfiletransfer  this app has the ability to receive files from the users, whom don't have the same app installed on his phone."
genonbeta/TrebleShot,closed,How does it work ?,[],"While both (or more) devices are connected to the same router one can share data between devices, please kindly explain few of my questions:

1) By using main router with internet access (where 10+ people are connected to it) and sending 1GB of data between devices using this app, do I impact/overload connection speed for others. Making their internet connection slower ?

2) Can I use it on access point/ repeater that's connected to main router, do I overload network capacity ?

3) Can I use it through Bluetooth ?

4) Can I make direct connection between devices ?"
genonbeta/TrebleShot,closed,Hotspot/wifi-direct,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Unless I missed it somewhere in the app there isn't a function to automatically create a hotspot or use Wi-Fi direct to send files to another device, you have to be on the same network already.

This would be extremely useful in making transferring just a couple files to another device quickly, by, for example, scanning a QR code with the information to connect to the access point / Wi-Fi direct."
genonbeta/TrebleShot,closed,Feature request: share directories,[],"Good day.

I recently started to use this app, and I noticed that the possibility to send whole folders seem to be missing. Upon trying to send a folder, the sender says `You are not allowed`, and the list of files to be sent appears as empty. Could you troubleshoot this?"

As you may have noticed, I haven't release any update or made commits since May. The problem is my computer is broken since then. As I'm a college student, I still saving money to buy a new one and I want you to know that I did not abandon the project.

Steps to reproduce (all on the same device):
1. Start TrebleShot 1.2.1 and add a remote device.
2. Download a file from Internet using a browser.
3. Open the Android's Downloads app.
4. Long press the file and tap Share.
5. Select TrebleShot in the sharing dialog. TrebleShot crashes.

The code assumes that each MediaStore entry has a DATA field:

            Cursor cursor = context.getContentResolver().query(fileUri, null, null, null, null);

            if (cursor != null)
            {
                if (cursor.moveToFirst())
                {
                    int dataIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA);
                    String dataPath = cursor.getString(dataIndex);

                    file = new File(dataPath);
                }

                cursor.close();
            }

This is not the case on recent Android versions. In general, [you cannot convert](https://commonsware.com/blog/2016/03/15/how-consume-content-uri.html) a `content://` URI into a `file://` URI."

genonbeta/TrebleShot,closed,i18n: needs more plurals,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Android developer's guide suggests using [plurals](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#Plurals) for ""quantity strings"" to make UI that looks and feels good in all languages.

Some of the strings in project's UI count something, like files or connections. Here are some that I've found:

```xml
<string name=""multi_transfer_que"">Receive %s file(s)?</string>
<string name=""multiple_receive_done_summary"">%s files received</string>
<string name=""delete_warning"">Do you want to delete %d file(s)</string>
<string name=""delete_completed"">%d file(s) is deleted</string>
<string name=""file_count"">%d file(s)</string>
<string name=""dialog_msg_remove_queue_job"">%d pending transfer(s) will be removed</string>
<string name=""available_connections"">%d connections</string>
```

To follow the guide, they need to be changed (at least some of them). For example, the first string would need to look like this:
```xml
<plurals name=""multi_transfer_que"">
    <item quantity=""one"">Receive %s file?</item>
    <item quantity=""other"">Receive %s files?</item>
</plurals>
```

The second string is only ever used for >1 files though, so it doesn't need to be changed, right? But it does! Many languages have non-trivial rules concerning plurals where correct spelling depends on the actual number (there are some examples in the quantity keyword table in the guide linked above). So this string also needs to be converted into `<plurals />` element and to include ""one"" and ""other"", even though it's used only for multiple files, otherwise it wouldn't look right in some languages.

This project is almost ready to receive translations, but not using plurals is something that can really prevent these translations from being complete."
