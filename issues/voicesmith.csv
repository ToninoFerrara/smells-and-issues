jurihock/voicesmith,open,Record to file + RECORD_SOUND_ACTION intent,[],"It would be much useful to be able to save a recoding into a file.
With this implemented you could then register Voicesmith for the [RECORD_SOUND_ACTION Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.Audio.Media.html#RECORD_SOUND_ACTION) allowing it to be called by any other app whenever a sound record is needed.

jurihock/voicesmith,closed,DenoiseProcessor,[],"I am working on a text to speech application and I record voice samples for diphone concatenation. (C#)

I need a noise reduction filter in my application because I don't have an isolated room for test recordings.

I had a look at the ""Noise Reduction"" filter in Audacity (http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/) and it works very well but its source code is too heavy to translate into C#.

I tested your application and the ""Try to reduce noise"" option seems to work well.

Can you compare your DenoiseProcessor.java code with the noise reduction filter in Audacity?

Do you have any other alternative source code library in Java to perform noise reduction?

Your help will be greatly appreciated because this is a major requirement in my application and I could not find any reliable source code to use in C#.

jurihock/voicesmith,open,problems with DAF,[],"Hi Juri, I am trying to use your codebase to add more features into it. Your AAF portion works best for me but DAF has no slider and looking at the source code seems that DAF is not integrated. Can you tell me how DAF can be made to work in your code? with a slider to change delay from 20 upto 400 or 500 ms. Also, using another library I found that there is an inherent delay based on devices when we try to delay audio ourselves. But that thing does not happen when we only try to change the pitch by semitones. Can you shed some light on it please ?

I also need to record the unprocessed audio into audio files. Perhaps you can give me a hint on where to hook my code to get the unprocessed audio frames so I could write them into audio files. Just so you know, I am an iOS / Android developer and have created a similar AAF/DAF App for iOS using Core Audio prior to attempting it on Android using your code as well as another couple of libraries.
