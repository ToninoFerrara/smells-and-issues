"
inguin/moneybalance,open,[Feature Request] Shared Balance,[],"I was looking for an app like yours today and it looks like that it fits my needs almost perfectly. Thanks for sharing it for free!

What would be a great feature is the possibility of sharing a balance within the group. In this case everybody would install the app. Now anyone could enter a new expense and it would be synchronized to all members.
I think Android has a feature where an app can store data in a cloud account that was previously registered within the system, doesn't it? So one could use a shared Dropbox, OwnCloud, Seafile, whatever folder for synchronizing the database.

inguin/moneybalance,open,Cannot enter decimal places,[],"I have a phone with German localization, Android 5.0 and the standard UI enhancements by Samsung. To enter an expense, I am presented with a numerical keyboard. This keyboard only allows to enter a “.” as decimal separator, and it cannot be replaced by another keyboard. When entering decimal places, moneybalance indicates that I did not enter a valid number and does not let me save it. So I have no possibility to enter decimal places. When I paste a number separated by “,” (comma) into the field (pasting is possible), it does not complain. To circumvent such problems, I suggest that “.” and “,” are equally treated as decimal separator and are automatically translated to the format required by the database or the localization settings.

Hi,

thank you for this app, The opensource alternative was missing.
The app is failing when I try to show a ""résumé"" of some simple expenses. I exported a CSV of the expenses that shows the problem. Any idea ? Maybe the locale of the numbers are not supported. The coma is used as a decimal separator.

inguin/moneybalance,closed,Update French and Spanish translations for release,[],"@Djiko @perdigano: After years of lazy idleness I have finally found the motivation to prepare a new release of my moneybalance app. The biggest new feature is the support of multiple currencies in a single calculation, which also required adding some new strings.

Could you please provide updated translations for the following strings:
- calculation_currency (changed from ""Currency"" to ""Main Currency"")
- manage_currencies
- additional_currencies
- add_currency

@perdigano: I'm awfully sorry for the long wait! I'll get a new release out ASAP.

inguin/moneybalance,closed,Add more  than10 persons,[],"Hi,

I have used this brilliant app for months and months and only recently, I needed to split money for more than 10 persons. I was surprised to notice that there was a limit. I mean, we are not often dealing with 99 persons, but a reasonable 15+ can happen.

I assume my query is not that complicated -I may be wrong though. What could it be done about this?

Thanks much.

M.

inguin/moneybalance,closed,retrieve moneybalance data from broken phone,[],"Hi.

We used this app which I really like a lot for our last trip. Since shortly after, my phone shows a software problem, which prevents me from opening the app to check our final balance. Also I did not export to .cvs before my phone broke.
I managed to download the data from the phone's internal storage and from the sd card though. On the latter I could not find anything related to the app, on the internal storage, there was a folder with exported cvs files from older trips, but I did not find anything else.
My question is, if there is any possibility to get the data back from some database files or so?

Thanks a lot, for the great app aswell as for any advice regarding my problem!

I was about to update your app on F-Droid, but doing so with ant is a pain (have to tinker with android-v7 paths). The problem that stops me from updating the app is that the appcompat-v7 library in the SDK dir is updated regularly, thus by using that lib we are not defining what release of the lib to use.

If you could use gradle to build it, or supply a simple build.gradle for it, that would help a lot.

Regards.
