daj/flashback,open,Flashback overlay blocks access to Decline/Accept-Call-Buttons,[],"I ran across Flashback two days ago when I was browsing F-Droid and thought it worth a try.

But when I get a call, I can't press any of the two buttons below the usual contact info (Decline[red]/Accept[green], not sure how they are called in English as my phone is localised in German). Also there is nothing to see from Flashback (as opposed to the screen-shots on Google Play).
I am guessing Flashback puts an overlay over the whole screen and blocks any input I make to take the call. On one occasion I found a spot where I could reach the red button and decline the call but not take it (BTW: the decline is left and accept is right in my setup).
Now after removing Flashback the behaviour has stopped.

Technical details:

HTC Desire X
Android 4.1.1
HTC Sense 4+

I'll be happy to add further details per request.
