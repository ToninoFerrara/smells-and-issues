ge0rg/gamemasterdice,open,Changed theme to material design and other minor changes,[],"Hi,

i used your app since a while (for DSA playing), but I didn't like the design, so I changed it. If you like to merge, do it.

Greetings

ge0rg/gamemasterdice,open,arbitrary number of seids on a die? ,[],"I would like to use your app for non-gaming purposes, allowing me to draw a random number from, say, `25`. Or, on different occasion, `32`. And so on. 

Would you consider adding a `Custom...` entry for the `Sides on a die`, allowing the user to specify an arbitrary number of seids on a die?

ge0rg/gamemasterdice,closed,Subclass refactor,[],"After I added the new dice set, a friend suggested that I take advantage of subclassing. I took that as a good excuse to learn more about Java and here's the result.

This turns DiceSet into an abstract class with a getDiceSet() method that returns whichever subclass is appropriate. 3D20 is implemented by DSADiceSet, FUDGE/Fate is implemented by FUDGEDiceSet, 1d2 by Coin, and everything else by StandardDiceSet.

It's relatively straightforward, but it does a little code complexity. Feel free to stick with whichever style you prefer.

ge0rg/gamemasterdice,closed,Add FUDGE/FATE Dice,[],"Hi! Love the dice roller. It's tiny, quick, and works well.

Decided to go about adding [FUDGE/Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge_dice#Fudge_dice) dice to the program. Here's my first attempt.
