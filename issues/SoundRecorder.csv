There is a [known Android bug](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=38282) related to exposing some files to MTP: depending on the way the app creates the file, it will appear via MTP only when the device is restarted (there are also other tricks you can do to solve the problem, [check this thread](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/46315/not-all-files-are-visible-over-mtp)).

As there is a number of open Issues I was wondering what your future plans with the app are. Are you planning to develop it further? Are you interested in incorporating the suggested features or should this app remain simple without any settings? Do you see this app more as a Voice recorder (=focus on recording low quality, low size audio files) or as a Music recorder (=focus on recording high quality, bigger size files) or generic (=can do both things, settings needed).

I use it to record music in high quality using an external microphone. However, I needed to tweak it a little to fit to [my needs](https://github.com/fabianrost84/SoundRecorder). For me it's currently the best open source app available. I used to like Rehearsal Assistant, but that seems not to be developed any further.

My internal memory is too small to store all my recordings. 

It seems to me that the only general solution to my problem to make the storate path selectable by the user. Is it planned to implement this? 

It also seems to be similar to the way the ownCloud Android app handles the storage of files (see https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/10). There they state the beta version of ownCloud now offers an option to select the storage path. Maybe one could learn from there.
