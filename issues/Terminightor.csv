theScrabi/Terminightor,open,Pausing the evil,[],"Feature request:
Yes it is somehow against the idea of termjnightor to have a snooze button, but how about a ""pause""? Of course, only once or twice, and only a minute or so - enough to make it to the NFC tag. After the number of pauses is exceeded - no more pause.
 Otherwise one risks to wake the entire neighbourhood (or hotel) while running to the tag, due to the nice and evil loud alarm. Not important for people in houses with thick walls, but otherwise... :-)

theScrabi/Terminightor,open,"Multiple Alarms at same time, can not be canceled. ",[],"I recently had several cases where the app went into ""ringing frenzy"", which sounded like it was playing several ringtones simultaneously. The alarm sounds normal for a fraction of a second, then it sounds like more and more alarms are started.
Stopping the alarm was also not possible.

I believe in all cases I had used an 'old"" alarm, which had been disabled for a long time, and then re-enabled it. It seems that then manybalarm events are generated somehow (the last part is speculation).

theScrabi/Terminightor,closed,"""Repeat"" set even though repeat box was never touched","[Label(name=""bug"")]","How to reproduce:
Add new alarm
Set time
Add Tag
(Do not set repeat, leave box unchecked)
Leave Dialog

Open the newly created alarm again

Outcome:
Now the alarm is mysteriously set to repeat on all days except Sat and Sun. 

Expected outcome:
It should still be without repeat, of course.

theScrabi/Terminightor,closed,Option for silencing alarm with *any* NFC tag,[],"Hi -
This is a really cool App!
I have a feature suggestion: Could you add a function to the NFC tag registratio that an alarm can be set such that it can be silenced by _any_ NFC tag? That way, one could even use those tags which change their ID all the time. The impact of the alarm would not be less than in the normal mode as long as you can assure that there are no tags next to your bed (which should be easy enough for most people). 

Advantage: you don't need to have a special tag, just use one of NFC cards you have in your wallet anyway (those are usually of the ID changing style).
Place the wallet in the kitchen/bath/wherever, voila.

Great work at any case!
