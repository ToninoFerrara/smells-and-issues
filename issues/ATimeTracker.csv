netmackan/ATimeTracker,open,Overlapping times,[],"This should be called 'Overlapping times between tasks'.

What is the reason for showing time sums in the main screen, rather than time entries in start time order?

I would find it more useful and informative if time entries were all shown one after another, with start and stop times. This would make it much easier for me to clean up mistakes I've made. At the moment there doesn't seem to be a view where I can spot if task times overlap or meet each other where they should.

As it is now, if I have to trim a task half an hour, and extend the preceding task, I can't get an overview of which tasks butt up to each other. So it's tricky finding the preceding task that I should extend. I have to try and guess or remember and check the tasks time entries one at a time."

netmackan/ATimeTracker,open,Suggestion: Lock screen controls,[],"Hi Markus, thank you for creating this cool app.

Now I'm not very technical so I don't know if this is possible. I had an idea that we could create controls for the app via the lockscreen to make it quicker to access as a 1 step process (instead of always having to unlock your phone -> access app) which is a 2 step process.

I'm not sure how it would work but maybe it could show the current task being timed and if stopped, it would allow the user to select a new task via a dropdown or something? (this is the assumption that only 1 task can be timed at one time)

netmackan/ATimeTracker,open,Provide integration with a Kimai instance,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","## Motivation

This app looks nice, however if one ends up having to track time with multiple devices, it's nice to have it stored in a central location. Also this allows for easier reporting.
## Proposal

There is a web application called Kimai (https://github.com/kimai/kimai) for which there a number of clients, which is actively developed and whose functionality is acceptably good. Also they provide a sort of API on a JSON basis.
It would be lovely if ATimeTracker could sync its entry with this web application.

netmackan/ATimeTracker,open,Tags,[],"Tags are discussed in a design doc from 2009 by the original author Steven Russel, and it's still a good idea, and while many of the tag-related ideas from that early concept are still applicable, like the free-text, many-to-many relations, but I think it can be done in a much simpler way, to the benefit of users and developers. 

I think it can be done with four easy pieces;

1) Add a new DB ~~table~~ field, Tags
- Tags are a space de-limited string array, existing only as task-time metadata
- Would export to csv  as 'name,tags,start,end' 
- eg. 'work,car Bob x:y-z,2016-10-03 17:23:25,2016-10-03 17:29:32'

2) EditTags dialog
- Opens text-edit dialog with full tag string (if any) ready for modification
- Obviates the need for TaskAdd, TaskMove, TaskDelete, TagMerge dialogs.

3) Tags-list-view
- An alphabetical list of all tags in use
- Click to (multi)select 
- Looks like task-view except instead of 00:00 time it has ($COUNT) number

```
_Tags_______________
[_] Bob                     (2)
[_] car                     (5)
[_] x:y-z                   (1)


  [    Add    ]   [  Filter  ]
```
- If task is running, selection(s) are added, else next task started gets the set

4) Tags are displayed with task-times
- ShowTimes enhanced with tags, eg

```
12:32 13:25 Bob car            00:53
15:14 17:15 x:y-z              01:01
```

and that's the gist of my lightweight tags idea, hope ya like it :)

![activities-shaded](https://github.com/linuxcaffe/timew-android/raw/design/mockups/activities-shaded.png)

so that users can see at a glance which tasks had activity in the selected timeframe.

"
netmackan/ATimeTracker,open,split clickable regions left and right,[],"(suggested first in #40) 

Is it possible to split the lines clickable regions into two parts, left and right? That is to say, you can click on the rightmost 00:00 numbers for one action (start/ stop) and click on any other (left side) part of the line for another action (Show times)? This presumes two sets of long-press options as well. 

I hope it's possible, to reduce false start/ stops (as in #40) and also to provide some more direct navigation and control (which I will describe in more detail, if the split-regions thing is even practical (not too difficult)) with (imho) significant usability benefits.

Then a user could fumble the start/stop and as long as the correction is made within 5 seconds, no problem. This doesn't have to affect the current behavior at all, and it's highly unlikely a < 5 second interval would be useful anyways.  

This should be configurable in the settings, and a setting of 0 would give current (no threshold) behavior.

netmackan/ATimeTracker,closed,14-May-2015 update causes application to crash when editing an ongoing task,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Reproduction steps:

1) Click on a task and start logging time.
2) Long press on task and hit ""show times"".
3) On the ongoing time (the one with a checkmark and without a finish time), either click or long press and hit ""edit time""
4) ""Unfortunately TimeTracker stopped"" warning comes up and application restarts. 

Luckily it doesn't ruin database. And once the time is stopped, the entry can be edited. But not without stopping it. Until this update I have been using this usage case without any issues.

Unluckily, I cannot edit how much time I really spent on a task directly in the app, so I have to export the database, edit it manually and re-import it after re-installing the app, because the app also does not have a function to wipe all my data.

For such cases is would be nice to have an editing function to change the time range spent on a task afterwards, as well as adding a new range when I accidentally forgot to clock in.

netmackan/ATimeTracker,open,Initial help reappears when rotating etc.,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""rotationissue"")]","Thanks for picking up this app from Sean Russel and working on it. I just discovered it via the What's New part of F-Droid and have some issues to report of my first impressions.

Regarding the initial help window that appears, I like the way that it appears whenever the app starts when there are no tasks listed. I think that is better than other apps where the help only appears on the actual first use. With your method if you run the app once but don't really use it, the help will appear again, until the user gets to the point of having added a task.

However, I think this method may have introduced a bug, which is that if the help is dismissed then the device is rotated, the help will reappear. It will also reappear if a sliding physical keyboard is slid open, or slid closed.
