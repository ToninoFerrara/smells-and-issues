emergentdotorg/shaman,closed,HTTP 400 Bad Request,[],"Occurs when doing a query with ""older"" and/or ""newer"" parameters in the url, on devices with a locale in wich the decimal separator is not the dot (french for instance, but many more exists).

This is due to the conversion of a double to a string using String.format(), which seems to use the current locale decimal separator.

Quick fix: in WeaveUtil.java, in method toModifiedTimeString, change:

String retval = String.format(""%.2f"", timed);
to:
String retval = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, ""%.2f"", timed);
