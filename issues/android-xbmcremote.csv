freezy/android-xbmcremote,closed,Added support for Xperial Play(and gamepads) as remote,[],"I love using my Xperia play as a remote for XBMC but I was feeling I could do so much more if I could use the physical buttons. 

I have added support for most of the basic functionality in the 'remote control' screen, so a user can have a similar experience as controlling netflix from their ps3 controller.

The only problem I encountered is the behaviour of the X(ps3) or A(xbox) button of the Xperia play. This button would be called because the KeyDown event was been intercepted by the parent view. For this reason I had to forcefully move the focus to the 'select' button after every keyUp event and then I had to make the 'select' button call it's behavior independably. It should not affect anyone that is using the touch interface. It would only cause conflict in the weird case someone is using another keyboard or keypad to control the phone, which would be improbable and impractical. 

FYI:

The changes are not as big as the diff make it to be. I was working on eclipse and I forgot I autoformated a layout file. The real changes only happened to the *.java files.

Which Android device are you using (and which ROM, if custom)?
android version 2.3.7
CyanogenMod-7-10022011-NIGHTLY-Blade

Which XBMC revision are you running and on which platform?
XBMC:11.0 (Mar 12 2012)
platform: windows 7

Please provide any additional information below.
The same thing would happen when you manually press the play button after the screen has dimmed/turned off. It will just wake up and not start playing yet. It seems like it can be solved by sending a play command twice

freezy/android-xbmcremote,closed,use cover art/thumbnails in notifications on platforms that support it,[],"These patches allow the xbmc remote to display thumbnails using the richer notification APIs available in newer Android versions.
- Below Honeycomb, notifications appear as they always have.
- On Honeycomb and up, they use the large icon functionality of the [Notification.Builder](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder.html) API. They look like [this](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9634624/screenshots/xbmcremote_ICS.png).
- On Jelly Bean and up, they expand on the large icon notifications with [Notification.BigPictureStyle](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.BigPictureStyle.html). They look like [this](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9634624/screenshots/xbmcremote_JB.png). When collapsed, they're identical to the large icon version.

Jelly Bean also adds the ability to add actions to the notification, which could be useful for quick access to playback controls (like the current Google Music app). I wasn't immediately sure of the best way to do this and decided not to include it, but it's an easy addition from here.

What are the ramifications of this? I found out about the current situation when I was looking to find out how to implement directory sorting in file mode. Turns out sorting is only supported in the new JSON version. Looking through the code, in it's lovely MVC format, it looks like the only bits that need to change are the URL builder and data deserializer. I can't imagine it's a huge effort? I'm willing to take it on to achieve my goal of file sorting =) Busy at the moment so should have it done within the month I'd imagine. Thoughts?

I want to factor out the simple remote / event client code into it's own app that would be smaller, simpler, and easier to build and maintain (think of XBMC Remote lite).

Standard android way of doing that is to create 3 separate android ""projects"", one that would be an android library and would contain shared resources and base class sources, and another two, one for each app => hence the move of the app into a directory, so that other xbmc remote apps that share resources and sources could also be tracked within the same repository (ie. there might be a dedicated tablet app in the future).
