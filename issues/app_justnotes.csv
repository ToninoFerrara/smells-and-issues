1. Option to put a **title** in the note. Maybe a white line when you are editing in the upper part where you can write a title or just leave it blank to stay like now.
2. Option to **change the colour** of each note easily. This makes easier to difference between them.
3. Option to **change the position or order** of a note to been able to put it the first one, the second or the last one as you please. Maybe the easiest way could be to push and drag and drop.
4. Option to **define how much of the note is previewed** in the general dashboard. Otherwise, a note with 1.000 lines for instances wouldn't let see anything, so being able to specify the number of lines in the preview would be nice.
