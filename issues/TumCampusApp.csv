1. `NetworkOnMainThreadException` in `BarrierFreeFacilitiesActivity`(fixed by moving the network call to a background thread)
2. Situations where view was null in `StudyRoomsActivity` (fixed by making it nullable; it’s not used anyway)
3. Crash when `CalendarController.QueryLocationsService` could not be started (convert `IntentService` into `JobIntentService`, which don’t experience the same crashes)"

This PR introduces dependency injection via Dagger into the app, which offers the following advantages: 
1. Classes no longer have to create their own dependencies, which is more in line with the Single Responsibility Principle
2. Better testability by injecting fake components instead of the real ones, e.g. for testing a ViewModel
3. Everyone on the project can learn about dependency injection 😊

There’s more to do besides this PR: 
1. Create subcomponents out of `AppComponent`, which are used in single Activities rather than throughout the entire app
2. Make more classes use dependency injection instead of creating dependencies themselves
3. Properly test that nothing broke (that’s why we have betas, right?)

- [ ] On the details page, the image is kind of big right now, maybe show 70% but make it scrollable if the user wants to see the full size image
- [x] On the start page we now have the events and tu film right next to each other. Best option would be, to display the ticket if there is one, otherwise just display the news item
- [x] It would be great, if we could link from the event to the tu film - let me know, if you need a reference from the backend for this

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Bump robolectric from 3.8 to 4.0.1,"[Label(name=""dependencies"")]","Bumps [robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) from 3.8 to 4.0.1.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [robolectric's releases](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/releases).*

> Robolectric 4.0.1 fixes several bugs in 4.0:
> ## Bug Fixes
> * NPE in `PackageParser` in binary resources mode [issue #4026].
> * `Activity.getLifecycle().getCurrentState()==CREATED` although activity is resumed [issue #4038].
> * 4.0 migration tool not working [issue #4052].
> 
> ## Known Issues
> * Android Gradle Plugin may report the following warning, which may be safely ignored: `WARNING: The option setting 'android.enableUnitTestBinaryResources=true' is experimental and unsupported.`
> 
> Use Robolectric:
> 
> ``` groovy
> testCompile ""org.robolectric:robolectric:4.0.1""
> ```
> 
> [Getting Started](http://robolectric.org/getting-started/) | [Migrating](http://robolectric.org/migrating/#migrating-to-40) | [Report Issues](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues). Enjoy!
> 
> Robolectric 4.0 brings support for the Android P (SDK 28) release, new and improved support and testing APIs for dozens of Android classes, initial support for some `androidx-test` APIs, and a complete rewrite of the resource handling code making it behave much more like a real Android device.
> 
> With the major version number bump to 4.0, we're making changes to some public APIs, detailed below. Check out the [migration notes](http://robolectric.org/migrating/#migrating-to-40) and use the new [automated migration tool](http://robolectric.org/automated-migration/) to help convert your existing tests to be compatible with Robolectric 4.0.
> 
> ## API Changes
> * Most `[**Implementation**](https://github.com/Implementation)` methods in shadow classes are now `protected` instead of `public`. Tests should always prefer to call SDK methods directly on Android classes rather than on their shadows [issue #4007].
> * `RuntimeEnvironment.application` has been deprecated, use `androidx.test.core.app.ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext()` instead.
> * `AutoCloseable` is now supported. In earlier versions of Robolectric, try-with-resources blocks would fail to call `close()` on the resource.
> * Bumped Android P to build 4913185.
> 
> ## Resources
> In conjunction with Android Studio 3.2, Robolectric can now use resources processed using the Android build toolchain, and loads and handles those resources using the same logic as on an actual Android device. Robolectric’s old idiosyncratic resource handling mode is still available for projects not yet using the latest version of the build toolchain, but is now deprecated.
> 
> ## New and improved SDK support and testing APIs for numerous Android classes, including:
> * `ActivityManager.getAppTasks()`
> * `ApplicationPackageManager` content providers, `canRequestPackageInstalls()`
> * `AppOpsManager`
> * `AsyncQueryHandler`
> * `AudioManager.getActivePlaybackConfiguration()`
> * `BackupManager`
> * `BluetoothAdapter` profile connection state and bond state
> * `Build.getSerial()`
> * `CameraManager` and `CameraCharacteristics`
> * `Camera.Parameters` preview sizes
> * `CarrierConfigManager.getConfigForSubId()`
> * `ConnectivityManager` support for `NetworkCapabilities`, `requestNetwork()`.
> * `ContentResolver.openOutputStream()`, 'getSyncAdapterTypes()'
> * `Context.bindServiceAsUser()`
> * `DevicePolicyManager.setUserProvisioningState()`
> * `EuiccManager`
> * `FontFamily`
> * Improvements to `AccessibilityNodeInfo`
> * `NotificationManager` support for `AutomaticZenRule`s

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [robolectric's releases](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/releases).*

> Robolectric 4.0.1 fixes several bugs in 4.0:
> ## Bug Fixes
> * NPE in `PackageParser` in binary resources mode [issue #4026].
> * `Activity.getLifecycle().getCurrentState()==CREATED` although activity is resumed [issue #4038].
> * 4.0 migration tool not working [issue #4052].
> 
> ## Known Issues
> * Android Gradle Plugin may report the following warning, which may be safely ignored: `WARNING: The option setting 'android.enableUnitTestBinaryResources=true' is experimental and unsupported.`
> 
> Use Robolectric:
> 
> ``` groovy
> testCompile ""org.robolectric:robolectric:4.0.1""
> ```
> 
> [Getting Started](http://robolectric.org/getting-started/) | [Migrating](http://robolectric.org/migrating/#migrating-to-40) | [Report Issues](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues). Enjoy!
> 
> Robolectric 4.0 brings support for the Android P (SDK 28) release, new and improved support and testing APIs for dozens of Android classes, initial support for some `androidx-test` APIs, and a complete rewrite of the resource handling code making it behave much more like a real Android device.
> 
> With the major version number bump to 4.0, we're making changes to some public APIs, detailed below. Check out the [migration notes](http://robolectric.org/migrating/#migrating-to-40) and use the new [automated migration tool](http://robolectric.org/automated-migration/) to help convert your existing tests to be compatible with Robolectric 4.0.
> 
> ## API Changes
> * Most `[**Implementation**](https://github.com/Implementation)` methods in shadow classes are now `protected` instead of `public`. Tests should always prefer to call SDK methods directly on Android classes rather than on their shadows [issue #4007].
> * `RuntimeEnvironment.application` has been deprecated, use `androidx.test.core.app.ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext()` instead.
> * `AutoCloseable` is now supported. In earlier versions of Robolectric, try-with-resources blocks would fail to call `close()` on the resource.
> * Bumped Android P to build 4913185.
> 
> ## Resources
> In conjunction with Android Studio 3.2, Robolectric can now use resources processed using the Android build toolchain, and loads and handles those resources using the same logic as on an actual Android device. Robolectric’s old idiosyncratic resource handling mode is still available for projects not yet using the latest version of the build toolchain, but is now deprecated.
> 
> ## New and improved SDK support and testing APIs for numerous Android classes, including:
> * `ActivityManager.getAppTasks()`
> * `ApplicationPackageManager` content providers, `canRequestPackageInstalls()`
> * `AppOpsManager`
> * `AsyncQueryHandler`
> * `AudioManager.getActivePlaybackConfiguration()`
> * `BackupManager`
> * `BluetoothAdapter` profile connection state and bond state
> * `Build.getSerial()`
> * `CameraManager` and `CameraCharacteristics`
> * `Camera.Parameters` preview sizes
> * `CarrierConfigManager.getConfigForSubId()`
> * `ConnectivityManager` support for `NetworkCapabilities`, `requestNetwork()`.
> * `ContentResolver.openOutputStream()`, 'getSyncAdapterTypes()'
> * `Context.bindServiceAsUser()`
> * `DevicePolicyManager.setUserProvisioningState()`
> * `EuiccManager`
> * `FontFamily`
> * Improvements to `AccessibilityNodeInfo`
> * `NotificationManager` support for `AutomaticZenRule`s

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,open,Use WorkManager instead of JobIntentServices,[],"this fixes #914

WorkManager has much more robust scheduling strategies, with automatic retry strategies built-in.

The reason was that we used a `DateTime` object with the current time to limit the range of events. By definition, all remaining events in the month are _after_ this time, so they were filtered out. 

Now, we’re explicitly setting the time to the start of the first day and to the end of the last day for the start time and the end time of the range, respectively.

This commit gets rid of `android.support.*` and uses `androidx.*` instead.
Also since PhotoView recently moved to AndroidX, it now builds unlike in #1108

<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [robolectric's releases](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/releases).*

> Robolectric 4.0 brings support for the Android P (SDK 28) release, new and improved support and testing APIs for dozens of Android classes, initial support for some `androidx-test` APIs, and a complete rewrite of the resource handling code making it behave much more like a real Android device.
> 
> With the major version number bump to 4.0, we're making changes to some public APIs, detailed below. Check out the [migration notes](http://robolectric.org/migrating/#migrating-to-40) and use the new [automated migration tool](http://robolectric.org/automated-migration/) to help convert your existing tests to be compatible with Robolectric 4.0.
> 
> ## API Changes
> * Most `[**Implementation**](https://github.com/Implementation)` methods in shadow classes are now `protected` instead of `public`. Tests should always prefer to call SDK methods directly on Android classes rather than on their shadows [issue #4007].
> * `RuntimeEnvironment.application` has been deprecated, use `androidx.test.core.app.ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext()` instead.
> * `AutoCloseable` is now supported. In earlier versions of Robolectric, try-with-resources blocks would fail to call `close()` on the resource.
> * Bumped Android P to build 4913185.
> 
> ## Resources
> In conjunction with Android Studio 3.2, Robolectric can now use resources processed using the Android build toolchain, and loads and handles those resources using the same logic as on an actual Android device. Robolectric’s old idiosyncratic resource handling mode is still available for projects not yet using the latest version of the build toolchain, but is now deprecated.
> 
> ## New and improved SDK support and testing APIs for numerous Android classes, including:
> * `ActivityManager.getAppTasks()`
> * `ApplicationPackageManager` content providers, `canRequestPackageInstalls()`
> * `AppOpsManager`

> * `AudioManager.getActivePlaybackConfiguration()`
> * `BackupManager`

We now persistently track the active alarms in the DB.
@thellmund voiced concerns about important Notifications, so I decided to not limit the creation of *single* notification alarms, but only when they are added in batch.

Also the Calendar and Transport notifications now only use up up to half of the remaining ""space"" for notifications, so there should always be space for the most important notifications."

This way, the user can go back to browsing their feed more easily. 

The fragment now also contains a ""Show in calendar"" button, so that the user can open the CalendarActivity and perform actions on the event (such as edit and delete)."

Please refactor this, to first let the feedback to be created and just later on, it will create the images if the first request was successful. 

Also you are using the same callback for different requests. This makes it harder to understand, what the intention of the programmer was and requires me to take a deeper look into the code to understand what is going on. 

So, heres a checklist, I would love to see a similar commit structure:
- [x] Create a new helper class maybe, that only deals with business logic = controller
- [x] Pull code from the FeedbackActivity (=View) regarding sending the feedback and put it into the controller.
- [x] Improve the code to resolve the above comments and simply pass a model between controller and view

This fixes the following issue(s): #970 
- doesn't remove numbers outside of brackets anymore
- doesn't remove random capital letters from the end of the title anymore

Tested for titles mentioned in the issue and my own events.

I'm currently having a android phone with microg as replacement for gms services. Sadly, the campus app crashes on startup, because google's analytics are not available.

I attached the startup log.

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,More beta fixes,"[Label(name=""Bug :bug:""), Label(name=""Improvement"")]","This pull request fixes some problems encountered in v2.0 beta 3 and 4: 
1. Introduces `EduroamFixCardViewHolder` and `NextLectureCardViewHolder` for greater stability and easier-to-understand code.
2. Updates the design of `NextLectureCard`, as the buttons on the right-hand side were both hard to hit (very small) and interfered with the options button. Now, we display a “show x more ...” button so that the user can expand the card and see up to four upcoming lectures.

* The card layout used a LinearLayout, wasting the right half of the display with empty space.

We now display the room number in addition to the room's name.
Also we now display the room details side by side with the link to the RoomFinder, resulting in a bit more condensed layout

1. Fixes a bug that prevented `MainActivity` from displaying cached content when offline. 
2. Removes `ConnectivityInterceptor` and `NoNetworkConnectionException`, as they prevented a proper use of the Retrofit cache.

- More use of whitespace
- Usage of MaterialComponents from Support Library 28, including the new text fields and buttons
- Updated iconography (outlined instead of filled icons)
- An updated behavior of the navigation drawer, more in line with other applications

Open issues: 
- `UserPreferencesActivity` uses the wrong theme for some reason. Will investigate. 
- The text looks a little off, as the new buttons use a different font than the text views. Will unify that before the release.

This commit introduced a breaking model change and is now incompatible with the current backend APIs, as the fields are currently named different. The intention behind it is right though and we should refactor out this ambiguity and not have different verification paths.

So we should make sure, that only `TUMCabeVerification` is used any more (already done, by merging the two other models) and that the `id` field is named `device` and only the ever the deviceId is sent to the backend. Please refactor any classes that still set this to the memberId and rename the field to indicate the correct id. 

We can then deduct the memberId correctly on the server side from the deviceId, as those should be linked correctly, once the wizard was completed. For those cases where the wizard did not link the user with the tumcabe member, we can offer a ""open up the wizard again"" card, to fix that setup. 

@thellmund please collect a list of API calls, that use this verification, so that I can adapt the server side implementation accordingly. This is high priority, as the current master branch is not usable in the current state.

> - `base`: Removed deprecated `public static` fields from `CharMatcher`. Use the equivalent `public static` methods instead. (f1249c4f0)
> - `base`: Fixed the `ServiceConfigurationError` that some users encountered when using Guava as a JPMS module. (8287cdfa3)
> - `cache`: Fixed a bug where `Cache.asMap.compute*` methods could cause nonsensical weights to be stored, breaking cache eviction. (15764d7f3)
> - `concurrent`: Removed deprecated `Futures` methods that implicitly use `directExecutor()`. (87d87f5ca)
> - `concurrent`: Added `ExecutionSequencer`, a new utility to run a series of asynchronous operations serially. (8d1fbc96e)
> - `concurrent`: Removed special-casing `UndeclaredThrowableException` in `Futures.transform()`. (9466b62f5)
> - `net`: Changed `HostAndPort.equals()` and `hashCode()` to stop depending on whether brackets were included. Now they depend only on host and port. (34c161627)
> - `net`: Added `HttpHeaders` constant for Sec-Metadata header. (986a3a3ef)
> - `net`: Added `MediaType` for ""application/hal+json"". (fea88fe49)

> 
> - `base`: Removed deprecated `public static` fields from `CharMatcher`. Use the equivalent `public static` methods instead. (f1249c4f0)
> - `base`: Fixed the `ServiceConfigurationError` that some users encountered when using Guava as a JPMS module. (8287cdfa3)
> - `cache`: Fixed a bug where `Cache.asMap.compute*` methods could cause nonsensical weights to be stored, breaking cache eviction. (15764d7f3)
> - `concurrent`: Removed deprecated `Futures` methods that implicitly use `directExecutor()`. (87d87f5ca)
> - `concurrent`: Added `ExecutionSequencer`, a new utility to run a series of asynchronous operations serially. (8d1fbc96e)
> - `concurrent`: Removed special-casing `UndeclaredThrowableException` in `Futures.transform()`. (9466b62f5)
> - `net`: Changed `HostAndPort.equals()` and `hashCode()` to stop depending on whether brackets were included. Now they depend only on host and port. (34c161627)
> - `net`: Added `HttpHeaders` constant for Sec-Metadata header. (986a3a3ef)
> - `net`: Added `MediaType` for ""application/hal+json"". (fea88fe49)

Just tested the code, while @kordianbruck just merged and closed the issue :tada: 
Turns out, @thellmund wasn't all wrong when mentioning nobody handled the `JsonParseExceptions`, because we were executing the calls manually only caught `IOExceptions`...
So instead we now do the calls with RxJava, which can properly handle all kinds of errors, so the app shouldn't crash anymore.

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Do MVV calls with Retrofit,"[Label(name=""Improvement"")]","fixes #977 

The `MvvStationListSerializer` is a bit ugly. 
@thellmund do you know, if there's a better way to parse schema-free JSON, then this?

I also added some unit tests, so the parsing should be quite stable...

When testing I also noticed, that `TransportationDetailsActivity` is really not great, since we're doing a lot of work in `onLoadFinished()`.
We probably need to switch that to a RecyclerView sometimes, so we don't drop frames like crazy"

We can further reduce the APK size. Android Wear 2.0 notifications no longer use the background image of the `Notification` ([source](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationCompat.WearableExtender#setBackground(android.graphics.Bitmap))), so we can remove a couple of images used as notification backgrounds and get the APK size to around 5 MB. I will do this in #879.

As we first need to talk to the Studentenwerk, we will first need a Mockup / XML in Android, that will showcase the usecase and make it clear that certain aspects are highlighted to the user:

- The credit is not ""live"" and can be lagging behind the real credit on the card. This needs to be made very clear
- There is no liability from our side, that the money shown is correct

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Ticket Sale: feedback from PR,[],implement Till's feedback from #973 
TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Fix wrong end time and timezone in calendar export,"[Label(name=""Bug :bug:"")]","This commit fixes two parts of the calendar export: 
1. The resource ID of the timezone string was passed as the timezone, not the timezone itself.
2. The start time of the event was also used as the end time."
TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Fix crash in MVVWidgetConfigureActivity,"[Label(name=""Bug :bug:"")]","This commit fixes a crash in `MVVWidgetConfigureActivity` which occurred when adding the MVV widget. It only occurred when the app was completely closed (removed from the Recents screen). 

**Reason**
In the constructor of `MVVWidgetConfigureActivity `, we passed `this` as the `Context` to `TcaDb.getInstance()`. There, we called `context.getApplicationContext()`, which will eventually invoke `ContextWrapper.getApplicationContext()`. There, `getApplicationContext()` is called on its property `mBase`, which is a `Context`. However, `mBase` is only set with `attachBaseContext()`. If we use `this` in the constructor, this method has not run yet."

## Comments

I integrated the events to the card view to the best of my knowledge. The earliest event is now shown in the MainActivity.
However, I do not have a good overview of all the interdependencies which I have to consider. It might very well be that I missed important cases.

The EventCard is not NotificationAware yet. Can we add that later if needed?

@kordianbruck Do you want this issue ready before the deadline tomorrow? If we are not sure if this PR could break something, we should maybe add it later. Maybe we should put the priority on finishing the remaining issues for the Admin app?

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,fix event details layout and date display,[],"@kordianbruck If I remember correctly, in the last meeting we discussed that the date and tickets text views in the event details should be added to a horizontal scroll view to avoid a line break.

Futhermore, I fixed the date display. Before, 14:00 or 2 pm was displayed as 02:00.
I found that the easiest way to specify a date format is using getDateTimeInstance(int dateStyle, int timeStyle);
It is Locale sensible and offers some predefined styles like DateFormat.DEFAULT or DateFormat.Short

In this PR I tried to implement a way to test this in debug builds and reliably reproduce shaky network conditions.

Additionally, I already added some error handling for TUMonline requests, but I still get random crashes, when deleting the cache...

Unfortunately, the logs are relatively cluttered with the network errors...
We can maybe tune down the logging of network error messages a bit, to get a better look on the actual crashes.

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Migrate TUMOnlineRequest to Retrofit,[],"**This is work in progress**

This pull request replaces `TUMOnlineRequest` with `TUMOnlineClient`, which uses Retrofit. The steps we took: 
1. We replaced SimpleXML with TikXML due to improved performance, smaller memory footprint and cleaner API. 
1. We added `TUMOnlineClient` and `TUMOnlineAPIService` for API access. 
2. We added `TUMOnlineInterceptor` to intercept requests, append the token parameter and throw exceptions in case of errors. This is necessary because TUMonline always returns 200, even in case of errors.
3. We removed `TumLock` and its associated DAO.

Building on these changes, we should do these things next: 
1. Update string resources with more appropriate naming. 
2. Update design of error layouts (nicer icons, larger text, proper headers).
3. Add TypeConverters (e.g. convert date strings to DateTime objects).

@schulzalexander and I discussed how we should implement the access to the ticket type data. The current model classes allow no connection between event and ticket type. However, a API call getTicketTypesForEventID exists.

The two options would have been:

1. Get all ticket types at startup and change the model classes to allow retrieving a ticket type for a certain event.
2. Get the ticket types for a certain event from the server when needed. 

We chose the second option as we figured it is easier to implement.

I am open to suggestions on how to improve the UI:

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Ticket Sale: Send events to calendar app,[],"TS-Mi-2: As a student, I can add the event to my preferred calendar app, so that I can see it in context of my schedule.
Each event should have an “add to calendar“-button in its detail activity (regardless of whether a user has already bought tickets for an event or not). Additionally, we can add an icon for this action to the section of each event in the event overview (possibly a tableView), if there is still space for this. Once an event is added to the local calendar, the icons/buttons should change their appearance to signal that the calendar entry has been created. Clicking on the very same icons/buttons again should simply remove the event from the calendar.
Adding an event to the default calendar can be done by using the Calendar Provider, which offers a bunch of Calendar Intents. These allow to specify the action you want to perform on the calendar, in our case, add an event. When executed, this will take the user right to the calendar app itself, where they can still modify and finally confirm the event. Afterwards, the user will be taken back to where they were in our app. Using this approach, we don’t need the WRITE_CALENDAR user-permission in our manifest, as compared to the other possibility of just adding the event to the calendar without user interaction, which would require that permission.

The problem was fixed by providing 0 as a default value in case the ""quality"" property is missing. While this no longer allows us to sort search results based on how well they match with the query, it at least provides the user with some results."

## Why this is useful for all students
- Smarter notification scheduling provides the user with the right information at the right time.

## Notes
- `TransportNotificationsProvider` currently returns no notifications, as it will need to be further refactored to provide intelligent scheduling.

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Implemented server calls getTickets() and getEvents() on client side,"[Label(name=""FeatureBranch""), Label(name=""Work in progress"")]","I started working on the client side server calls. I implemented the methods getTickets() and getEvents(). I have verified them with a local server using the static API endpoints.

I copied the data classes Event, Ticket and TicketType from the Eventsoverview branch to be able to test my code.

Some open questions for me are:

1. Should we use a controller like in NewsController or a ViewModel as e.g. in KinoViewModel to manage the data?
2. I saw that for other components @Dao objects are used. As I understand it, the data is downloaded from the server and saved in a local database. I guess, we should also use a local database for events, right? 
Currently, I save the donwloaded data in attributes in EventsController. Can I use this approach and add the local database later?
3. I did not really understand how to pass parameters in server calls. There are multiple options like Path for including parameters in the url or Body for passing objects. The following call expects two parameters which are not part of the URL
GET api/event/ticket/validate

Parameters:

    event_id (required) -> event that the ticket is associated with
    code (required) -> ticket code

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Update behavior of Navigation Drawer,"[Label(name=""Suggestion :telescope:"")]","**Solution today** 
When the user selects a list item in the Navigation Drawer, we open a new Activity. 

**Problem today** 
When the user repeatedly selects list items, they end up with a stack of Activities. They need to tap back multiple times to get back to MainActivity. Also, these Activities have a back button _and_ show the Navigation Drawer when swiping in from the left. 

**Proposed solution** 
We convert all Activities into Fragments. When the user selects a list item, we perform a Fragment transition in MainActivity. Exceptions are About, Feedback and Settings – they can remain Activities. 

**Benefits** 
For the user: 
- Simplified navigation flow without huge backstack
- Navigation Drawer icon will be visible as an affordance all the time

For us: 
- No need to include the Navigation Drawer in every layout
- More flexibility for the future (e.g. introducing bottom navigation)

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Refactor CardManager,"[Label(name=""Suggestion :telescope:"")]","## Problem
When I was fixing a bug in MainActivity (tapping “Open card settings"" crashed the app for some cards), CardManager’s current behavior made it unnecessarily difficult. 

## Suggested Enhancement :sparkles:
I suggest refactoring CardManager and surrounding classes in the following ways: 

**CardsManager**
1. We update the CardsManager.update() method to return _LiveData_, so that we don’t need to take care of managing listeners ourself (also, lifecycle-aware 😎; in CardsWidgetService and DownloadService, we can use a CardsManager.updateNow() method to do it synchronously).
2. This can also help us to remove calls like `CardManager.getCard(index)` within the CardAdapter. The Adapter should be provided with its list of items, not request the appropriate one on every onBindViewHolder. 

**MainActivityViewModel**
1. We add a ViewModel that stores all UI data in MainActivity. 
2. This ViewModel performs the calls to _CardsManager_.
3. This helps us separate concerns and simplify MainActivity. 

**DiffUtil**
1. We use _DiffUtil_ with _CardsAdapter_ to determine differences between the old list of items and the new list. 
2. It automatically adds insert/remove animations, resulting in a nicer user experience. 

**Listeners**
1. We pass a listener to CardViewHolders that notifies the CardAdapter when a Card’s menu item was selected. 
2. This allows for a more streamlined reaction to “Always hide”, as this option should not only update the SharedPreferences, but immediately hide the corresponding Card.

**Open Questions**
We currently also update the cards on a swipe down and on connectivity change. I’ll research how to best implement those with LiveData.

## Steps performed
I took the following steps: 
1. Add dependency for 3rd-party framework for circular ImageView
2. Migrate UI elements in PersonDetailsActivity to something more in line with Material Design
3. Convert PersonDetailsActivity to Kotlin
4. Add PersonContactItemsAdapter, which is responsible for displaying all ways of contacting a person
5. Add AbstractContactItem and subclasses EmailContactItem, HomepageContactItem, InformationContactItem, MobilePhoneContactItem,  OfficeHoursContactItem, PhoneContactItem, RoomContactItem to encapsulate the contact information and the associated actions (phone -> call, homepage -> open in browser, room -> open room finder)
6. Add PersonGroupsAdapter, which is responsible for displaying a person’s groups (consisting of function and org)
7. Made changes that required other changes in PersonSearchActivity. As a result, switch from ListView to RecyclerView and convert entire class to Kotlin
8. Move code to save a person to phone contacts to a dedicated ContactsManager class"

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Setup Wizard stuck when token not activated properly first time,"[Label(name=""Bug :bug:"")]","### Steps to Reproduce

If you haven't activated the token and enabled all (?) rights the first time you tap NEXT after the token was requested, you're stuck forever. Even if you activate the token and its rights afterwards, the app won't work. NEXT will fail, as will SKIP. You have to delete app data / reinstall the app to get another try.

### Environment
* Phone: Nexus 7 (2013)
* OS version: 6.0.1

Past events were not shown in calendar. I set the number of past months shown in calendar to 2. Not sure if going much further into the past is necessary.

## Why this is useful for all students
Because now user can check past events in their calendar.

The basic idea is that every TCA user generates WifiMeasurements in 
random intervals. At home I've set the pause times to alternate inbetween
the range 10s to 2min and the battery consumption measured by my samsung
power monitor improved only slightly. In the current commit the timespan is set
about 3 times as big (until 7min) and therefore I expect almost no raise in power
consumption at all. Currently the accumulated scans are sent to the backend with
every iteration of the StartSyncReceiver, which is set to 3hours.

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Study Cards,"[Label(name=""Feature :tada:""), Label(name=""Work in progress"")]","## Documentation see [wiki/Study-Cards](https://github.com/TCA-Team/TumCampusApp/wiki/Study-Cards)

## Outline
For every lecture attending students can create study cards containing a question text and an answer text representing a front and a back side of a classical paper study card. Optionally a card can contain an image on the front and or back side. These Cards sorted by the lectures and by custom tags. Using this structure all students can see, the cards, search through them and edit them as well.
After the creation the students can use the cards to learn the content in a quiz style process. First they see the question and can think about it. After they pressed so see the answer they can give feedback whether they knew the answer or not. Furthermore they can give feedback about the content of the card or add a comment.
## Milestones
### Milestone A
Develop a model and a first simple backend API implementation. 
### Milestone B
Use the API provided by the backend to create a first simple frontend containing the creation process as well as the quiz process.
### Milestone C (optional)
Implement tag structure, editing of cards, feedback to the card content as well as commenting features.

## Next Steps
- [x]  add card title to model
- [x] rename user to member in model
- [x] add rating to comment in model
- [x] add/edit card mockup
- [x] quiz mockups
- [x] aggregated rating
- [x] mark card as duplicate of another
- [x] filter cards by creator
- [x] add tags in card add/edit/view screen
- [x] model active days
- [ ] Created at in edit and filter
- [ ] Add possiblity to show card or remove card in quiz
- [ ] Add possibility to add card or remove card in card view
- [ ] Settings wheel in overview becomes build icon (wrench symbol)
- [ ] Add creator to card item
- [ ] endpoint specification

I'm an EE student and signing up to some Tutorübungen leads to 10 extra ""lectures"" every week, sometimes 3 or more at the same time, making the calendar very cluttered. It would be really nice to be able to hide them.

Thanks a lot,
Johannes

Here's a checklist what we can do, when upgrading to minSdkVersion 14:
- [x] Remove the NineOldAndroids library, that's been deprecated and not updated since 2014
- [x] Remove the usage of the deprecated ClipboardManager in InformationActivity
- [x] Remove the ""@TargetApi"" annotations in CalendarHelper, CalendarManager, MensaWidget, MensaWidgetService, MensaRemoteViewFactory, CardsWidget, CardsWidgetService
- [x] Remove the branch in OpenHoursListFragment.onCreate()
- [x] Remove the ""@SupressLint(""NewApi"")"" in MainActivity
- [x] Replace ActivityCompat.invalidateOptionsMenu() with Activity.invalidateOptionsMenu() in CalendarActivity, GradesActivity, MainActivity
- [x] Merge the differently flavoured AndroidManifests

The idea is to integrate such a feature in the TCA and add it to the default subscriptions, while the TCA itself may check certain requirements (e.g. question requires CS student). 

Furthermore the self-administration needs to be developed, since it should not be moderated by us, too. For instance each user may ask a question once a week and users may flag it as inappropriate, which deletes the questions after a few votes. 

In general the person asking the question may review the results all the time, before the question is removed after 30 days maybe.

Beside that I improved many details as there is no a central class doing all the work with signing. This makes it very easy to implement a verification of the device on every request in the future, which will reduce abuse of our apis.

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,"Less lax rounding at ""Next lecture in ...hours""","[Label(name=""Bug :bug:"")]","**Steps to Reproduce**
- connect your TumOnline Calendar to the App
- wait until exact 2h before a lecture starts
- wait one minute

**Expected Result**
- App tells me, my lecture starts in 1h and 59min or
- App tells me,  my lecture starts in about 1h 45min

**Actual Result**
- App tells me, my lecture starts in 1h (compare attached Screenshot)

**Problem**
This is unfortunately pretty much missleading, as I'm mostly checking the time until the next lecture by having a quick look on ""lecture starts in..h"". And telling that the lecture starts in 1h even though it starts in 1h and 59min is simply wrong.
Btw: this issue appears every hour.

:sparkles: **Suggested Enhancement**:sparkles: 
- round time until next lessons up to minutes or
- round time up to 15min and set an ""about"" or ""~"" in front

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,"Use Eduroam AccessPoint-IDs as ""low quality positioning system"" / Indoor navigation","[Label(name=""Suggestion :telescope:"")]","The idea would be to gather data about room / wifi-access-points - correlation (on a server) to determine (on phone) when someone is e.g. leaving early and improve silence service.
see also #285

**Data gathering:**
- Integrated into some service
- When person probably is in a certain room (only 1 current lecture; midway; requires #300 to be solved), gather Wifi-Data of selected Networks
- Send Room ID and Wifi-Data to Server

**Server-Side:**
- Maintain a Table of Room IDs and Access-point-strengths plus input time
- Calculate Average of the _latest_ Data => Get Typically Receivable Access-points per Room (_TRA_)
- Provide API to upload Data and get the TRAs for a room

**Data usage:**
- When user should currently be at a certain room, get TRAs for this room from server
- Compare list to actual situation
- If correlation is small, assume user is not attending lecture; deactivate silence-mode

Some thoughts:
- Selected Networks would only include _eduroam_, _lrz_, etc... to improve privacy
- actual comparison on phone => improve privacy
- wrong data should not influence the average TRAs
- as old data gets dropped, any changes to the network should be reflected by the network pretty quickly
- the usual wifi outage could be problematic

What do you guys think?

TCA-Team/TumCampusApp,closed,Force close due to missing location information in calendar entries,"[Label(name=""Bug :bug:"")]","I noticed a force close when:
- viewing a non-empty day in the calendar section
- tapping on a date of an event which appears on the main/card section

After some debugging, I found out that the reason for this is a NullPointerException. It happens when the app tries to access the location of an event with an empty location field from the local database.
From my logcat:

```
de.tum.in.tumcampus E/AndroidRuntime﹕ FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-1749
    Process: de.tum.in.tumcampus, PID: 30386
    java.lang.NullPointerException
            at de.tum.in.tumcampus.auxiliary.calendar.Event.generateEventFromCursor(Event.java:110)

            at de.tum.in.tumcampus.auxiliary.calendar.EventLoader$LoaderThread.run(EventLoader.java:174)
```

I also had a look on the database the app uses. There weren't any dates with available location info, which is probably not the way the calendar table should look like.

Are there any other people with problems of that kind?
I'm using an OnePlus One, running CM11S (Android 4.4.4).

So far we can only kindly ask the users to update (if auto-update is disabled / usage of fdroid version etc.) via facebook maybe. In the current case an upcoming update has to be actually enforced (or the usage of the TCA blocked). 

For these (very special) cases we need an option to stop all running TCA services and block the actual usage of the TCA to force the users to update. An information message should be displayed, too. Of course, we should be able to select the affected version.

Also the pick-up time is attached. By default these rides should be free of charge or cost-sharing only (e.g. 1-2 Euro maybe). It's not possible to chat in this room nor to contact the driver. Just simple and straight forward. Nevertheless it's possible to show interest so that other users know when it gets crowded.
