jochem88/clean-calculator,open,Error Evaluating Multiple Valid Operators,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The calculator does not evaluate some valid expressions with multiple operators such as (1++1). Correct evaluation is carried out with multiple operators if two negation operators are used (like with (1--1)), but any other combination (such as (1---1)) results an error.

The calculator already (correctly) displays an error if evaluation were attempted on a string of operators, but it may also be helpful if you could restrict input of a successive string of operators if (*), (/) or (%) were entered.
"
jochem88/clean-calculator,open,Incorrect Evaluation of Expressions with Function Immediately Following a Number,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","The calculator ignores numbers immediately preceding functions. With an expression such as (9sin(30)), the calculator evaluates (sin(30)), ignoring the 9 and displaying 0.5 for the answer. This also happens if the preceding integer were substituted with a double.
"
jochem88/clean-calculator,closed,Floating point errors,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Your calculator produces the usual floating point errors when dealing with e.g. 0.1. Perhaps you need to switch to BigDecimal or some arbitrary-precision arithmetic library?
