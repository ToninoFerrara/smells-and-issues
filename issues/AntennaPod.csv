danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Add delete option to episode's context menu,[],"Closes #2548. This PR makes following changes:

 - Adds delete option to episode's context menus in queue and feed list

 - Adds a storage preference that allows episodes to be automatically removed from queue when they are deleted (by clicking delete in context menu, or pressing trash can icon on `Completed` tab of `Downloads` page)

 - Adds a test for the aforementioned preference

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,FR: Allow per-podcast sort and download order option ,[],"As a threshold, it would be useful to be able to choose sort order in the podcast view (the view of all episodes in a given podcast), and for this setting to be remembered for each podcast.

Ultimately, it would be great if, for each podcast, a user could choose not only the sort order, but also the download order. This would be useful for certain podcasts that are meant to be listened to chronologically (e.g. History of Rome).

As an example, for a podcast like the History of Whatever, I would like the episode list to be filtered to show unplayed episodes (this can already be done), sorted from oldest to newest, and set to download the next oldest unplayed episode (so that whenever I finish an episode, the next one auto-downloads).

For this to be truly useful, it would have to be remembered for each podcast, so that once I set these things, the episode view for the podcast defaults to my chosen settings.

A further enhancement would be per-podcast download settings, where I could select how many episodes of a given podcast I would like to auto-download, following that podcast's download order preference.

One example of an app that handles these use cases quite well, though I am sure that there are others, is Player FM. I'm not much of a fan of that app for unrelated reasons, but the ability to customize how a podcast is displayed and downloaded is admirable.

**Expected Behaviour:**

If the storage space is completely full and fetching the feeds fails because of that, show an error message saying that.

**Current Behaviour:**

Yesterday, all of my feeds would come back with an ""invalid type"" error message upon refresh. This persisted for about 12 hours, until I listened through a podcast, thus freeing up memory via auto-delete. Refresh worked again immediately after that.

1. *Completely* fill the disk (this is somewhat difficult to do by hand)

2. Press the ""refresh"" button


**Environment:**

I'm currently running my device with my memory almost completely full. The amount of space still available varies depending on the podcasts I delete/download.


**My hypothesis:**

Refreshing the feed needs some minuscule amount of storage space. If that space is not available, it will fail. The error message returned, however, is an ""invalid type"" message, because the error case was not foreseen and the ""invalid type"" error is returned from the first error check that fails.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,How do I recover a Corrupted Database?,[],"I somehow lost all of my subscription information. The app behaves as if I've never subscribed or listened to anything. The directory structure still has info for all of my podcasts, though, and a file called ""CorruptedDatabaseBackup"", which was modified on the day that I first saw this problem. Is there anything I can do to rebuild my subscription/queue info, without wiping the directory and starting from scratch?

**App version:**
Version 1.6.6-RC1 (Beta Tester), released July 22, 2018.
Downloaded and installed from the Google Play Store

**Android version**:
Android Version 9.0 (codename Pie)
Verizon pushed this over-the-air software update on September 5, 2018
No custom ROM

**Device model**:
Google Pixel (1st generation)

**Expected behaviour**:
I have around 20 different podcasts in my feed. I generally have about 10 files downloaded and ready for play in my queue. Recently, I have had a backlog of about 500 un-listened episodes in my Subscriptions, as I have been about 2 months behind for a bit.

**Current behaviour**:
The app behaves as if I have no Podcast subscriptions, no items in my Queue, no Playback History, In addition, my ""Total time of podcasts played"" is listed as ""0.0 hours"", even though I have definitely listened to hundreds of hours via this app. It basically looks like I have never used the app before, though my settings seem to be in tact, because it knows I listen as 1.1x speed.

I don't know what I did to cause this. I reboot my phone regularly. I have >1GB of free space. I have not rooted or unlocked my phone, nor installed any strange/custom ROMs. I am an AntennaPod Beta tester, and let the app update whenever a new version is released, though there was not a new release coinciding with this issue.

But the actual install directory on my phone does show that my subscription information has not been completely erased, though my database may have been corrupted. My current directory structure looks like the following. Note the file named ""CorruptedDatabaseBackup:
```
\Pixel\Internal shared storage\Android\data\de.danoeh.antennapod
    cache\ (empty)
    files\
        cache\
            Contains a list of 49 podcasts, many of which no longer produce new episodes

        import\ (empty)
        media\
            Contains 85 directories, one for each podcast, though many are ones I unsubscribed from long ago.
            Within those 85 dirs are a total of 22 episodes in MP3 format

        crash-report.log (1.35KB, modified 9/7/2018 6:23 PM)
```


**First occurred**: Version 1.x / about x days/weeks ago
I first noticed this on October 2, 2018. I use the app frequently, so this issue must have first occurred no earlier than September 30, 2018.

**Steps to reproduce**:
No steps are required. Any time I open the app, even after a reboot, it looks like I have no subscriptions, like I have never used the app before.

**Environment**: [Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. ""Unusual"" devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?]
I just use this Google Pixel phone, though I often connect to Bluetooth devices (car, Google Home speaker, Anker Bluetooth Speaker) or use standard headphones.
I don't use Prestissimo.
I listen as 1.1x playback speed.
I don't have Auto Download enabled.

**Stacktrace/Logcat**: 
There is a ""crash-report"" file available, but it is from September 7, 2018. I have used the app extensively after that date. It was the beginning of October when this problem first occurred. But here is the contents anyway:

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,[Feature Request] Filter Feeds for Episodes that are Favorites,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","Hi, You can already filter a feed for quite a few properties but the one that I used to use regularly in BeyondPod is missing in AntennaPod.

Sometimes I want to listen to my favourite episodes from only one feed. But I can't filter for episodes I have added to favourites on a particular feeds page.

I know I can search for episodes from that feed in the favourites section. This is fine option when searching for just one episode with a specific guest or topic, but when looking for favourite episodes generally from a feed and using a search, results are mixed up with results from other feeds and are out of order.

I would be quicker and easier to filter a feed for episodes added to favourites. Then there would be no erroneous results from other feeds, and the results would be in correct chronological order.

Would you consider adding this please?

Thanks for your help."

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Numerical field & pad for Parallel Downloads dialog (currently accepting but ignoring non-numeric input),[],"Trying the beta version released it struck me that the Parallel Downloads setting (Network section) can have any type of (textual) input. Any textual input will be ignored and the existing numerical value will be kept. Also, the user gets presented a text keyboard, rather than posing a numerical pad, creating (little) extra effort to set a number.

Would be great if we could just have a numerical field and a number pad presented to the user instead.

If I understand correctly, this was required at the time the feature was introduced (#672) as the best option required API 11 which apparently wasn't available, but in the meantime we're at least at minimal API 14 (#2526). Think we could now have a numeric field, then?

**Expected behaviour**: After pausing playback for any reason, the AntennaPod notification should persist until I dismiss it or turn off/restart the phone.

**Current behaviour**: The AntennaPod notification containing playback controls does not persist for long after pausing, either by hand, by disconnecting headphone jack or Bluetooth, or by phone call. Therefore, playback typically does not resume when I reconnect the headphone jack or Bluetooth, or after I finish a phone call. 

**First occured**: Since last update (I think).

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Play a podcast in the app.
1. Pause playback for any reason.
1. After a few minutes with the app not in focus, the notification goes away.

**Environment**: Problem occurs when playing through headphone jack and Bluetooth. Changing the media player does not appear to have an affect. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't appear to help.

This is very inconvenient and distracting while driving because the audio instructions from the navigation app are read relatively slowly compared to the dialog of a given podcast, which is difficult to keep listening to during the duck. The user has to manually rewind in order to hear what was missed during the interruption.

**First occured**: Since last update (I think).

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Play a podcast in the app.
1. Begin navigation with Waze.
1. Podcast audio will duck for Waze interruptions instead of pausing.

**Environment**: Problem occurs when playing through headphone jack and Bluetooth. Changing the media player does not appear to have an affect. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't appear to help.

This option has two primary effects:

1. The cleanup algorithm will keep the 5 latest episodes for each feed. If the cache is small, or the number of feeds is high, the cache can get full and never be reduced.
2. The download algorithm will only consider the 5 latest episodes in each feed for download. It will not fetch more, even if there is space for it.

I hope the tests are pretty clear about other less significant implementation details. I'll be running it on my phone the next few days to get a feel for its real world behavior.

There are a few comments in the test files regarding tests I am unsure would be suitable behavior atm. Will take care of them once I've done some real world use. Feedback is also appreciated.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Reduce splash duration,"[Label(name=""discussion"")]",Closes #2793
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Reduce splash duration,[],"# Problem
The splash screen is displayed quite long, even if the database access is done in background as of #2781. This issue analyzes the problem and suggests solutions.

The long splash screen is mainly influenced by three method calls (removing those makes the splash screen much shorter):

- `loadData();` in `MainActivity`'s `onResume`
- `loadMediaInfo();` in `ExternalPlayerFragment`'s `onActivityCreated`
- `loadItems(true);` in `QueueFragment`'s `onResume`

All three methods use rxjava to query the database and afterwards do heavy UI changes (like displaying the queue's list). The interesting observation here is that adding a `Thread.sleep` call to the background work of these methods makes the splash screen **shorter**. While sleeping, you can see a progress bar in the app's view. When removing the sleep call, you can **not** see the progress bar. The UI is instantly updated as soon as the splash screen goes away. This leaves me with the conclusion that the background work of the rxjava calls is so short that the result is directly posted to the main thread. The result is already posted while the splash screen is still dismissing, what makes the UI thread stop displaying animations.

## Solution 1
Adding `.delay(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` to the rxjava call allows the splash to go away before the result of the background thread is delivered to the main thread. This has the disadvantage that, while the app loads significantly faster, loading the queue itself is delayed. Changing the delay down to 100ms introduces some kind of a race condition: sometimes the splash screen is long and sometimes not.

## Solution 2
Posting the call to `loadData` on a new handler makes the system start loading data **after** the splash screen is dismissed: `new Handler().post(this::loadData);`. This does noticably decrease the splash time and displaying the queue itself does not feel slower.

# Benchmarks
I used the average of two app starts and pressed my stopwatch as soon as the screen changed from blue (splash) to white (queue). The queue contained only two items. The effect gets stronger when there are more items present.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Direct call</b></td><td>2.898s</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Delay rxjava</b></td><td>1.990s</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Post handler</b></td><td>1.897s</td></tr>
</table>

By the way, the release version with #2794 (posting a handler) only needs 0.98s until the splash screen is dismissed.

# Suggestion
I suggest to use `new Handler().post(this::loadData);` because it does not slow down loading the queue items. I do not advise calling the method directly because the longer splash screen might lead to ANRs on slower devices. Reducing the splash duration by 30% also makes the app feel a lot more responsive. I think that this is worth the kind of ugly looking code. I suggest to link to this issue in a comment to explain that code usage to developers."

If there would be a page where you have a list of all you subscriptions and you only un-/tick the preferred podcasts, it would be much easier.

@ByteHamster: Thank you so much for the improved settings/preferences! Looks a whole better with the #2634 updates :)

Doing the translations (and now after having updated to RC1 on my device myself), I would like to make the following suggestions:
- 'buttons' section title: doesn't cover just any button in the app, but only specific ones. To make it more descriptive, I would call the section 'Play, Forward, Rewind'
- 'video behavior': in Transifex you said the options are Stop (current behavior), Play Picture-In-Picture, and Continue playing audio only. In my instance I don't see the PIP, however. Is that dependant on another setting, or could it be a bug? (PIP introduced in #2506)
- 'video behavior': not very descriptive title, I'd suggest to title this setting 'Upon exiting video'
- 'Mobile updates' is there to limit data usage, so I wouldn't necessary put it under 'automation' but rather under 'details'
- 'Mobile updates': this only concerns refreshing of feeds, right? Or also the downloading of episodes? In either case, I think it would be good to make explicit in the settings. (I know this was already there, but now seems a good time to improve)
- 'Set subscription counter': this setting could also determine the order of the feeds in the menu (dependent on other setting). We should probably make that explicit in the setting description. (idem: present before but a good time to change)
- 'Select theme' - True black: I know this theme is really black, but I would propose 'Black (AMOLED ready)'. 'Black' already indicates its colour, it indicates already it's darker than 'dark', and 'true' doesn't mean a lot. To support the search function, including the word Amoled would be good I guess.
- 'Exoplayer': written as such in the settings, but in the 'About' section it's with a capitalised 'P': ExoPlayer. [Educated guess](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer): this should be corrected?

Android version: 6.0 plain

Device model: LG-G4 (H815)

Expected behaviour: Correctly execute the commands
 
Current behaviour: app goes out of control

First occured: Version 1.6.5 about 7 days ago

Steps to reproduce:

1) play after an mp3 file;
2) after few minutes of playback, perform some actions (stop/play, rewind/forward) either via sw button or via headphones/BT earbuds;
3) antennapod goes out of control: sometimes it turns off the playback, sometimes it keeps playing the song but the buttons don't work anymore (except the button that regulates the playback speed). Even the playback time slider no longer works. To make it stop, I have to turn off the phone.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Is there a guide on how to use this app?  It is very confusing.,[],"I've tried using this app several times over the years and it has the most confusing interface of any podcast player I've tried.  After finding a podcast and adding it to my subscriptions I have no idea if it's actually going to start automatically downloading episodes offline.  I end up clicking around to mark all unplayed and then downloading them.  I don't understand why all of the subscriptions would be listed along the left side instead of just defaulting to an interface such as the subscription list.

If there is a process to do these things it isn't intuitive.  It seems made to subscribe to rss feeds, download, and play audio files... but there is no workflow.

It would be nice to see a button or longpress action to play all of one subscription in order and another button to play all subscriptions.

If I subscribe to something begin auto-downloading the first X episodes.

There's a queue list, episodes list, downloads list, and playback history.. Why do I need all of this?  None of them have a button to just start playing the list.  A queue lock and unlock button?  What does that even mean?

Just trying to give some constructive criticism."

Then, when the Play button is pressed, it starts playing from the place where the progress bar stopped, as a second channel, while the original playback continues (so you hear two parallel recordings). Closing the app stops both playing channels.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Disable subscriptions without removing,[],"It would be great if one could disable a subscription without removing it. This is a feature request.

A disabled subscription should differ from a normal subscription in the following ways:

* It is displayed differently in the subscription list (e.g. grayed, or in a separate section below the normal subscriptions)
* Its RSS/Atom feed is not updated
* It can be enabled again

In all other aspects, a disabled subscription should behave identically to normal subscriptions, that it:

* Already downloaded episodes are kept and can still be played.
* Non-downloaded episodes are still shown, are downloadable, and then playable.
* Disabled subscriptions are still part of an OPML export.

Rationales:

* For some podcasts one would like to listen to a few episodes, but doesn't want them to regularily fill up the ""New Episodes"" section.
* Adding new podcasts is a lot more work than deleting them. So when in doubt, one would rather disable than remove a subscription.
  * This is especially true for the German podcast world, where the podcast directories aren't nearly as complete as one would like them to, so adding new podcasts happens mostly by URL or website link, which is cumbersome.
* Sometimes RSS/Atom feeds are broken, or were only one-off feeds in the first place, while the media files are still downloadable from some CDN."

**Steps to reproduce**:

The DB excessive growth seems to stem from normal usage.

Importing might have exacerbated the problem, however: the database file from my custom build (that I used in the last month or so, based on 1.6.5) grew to 86Mb, with 400K rows in FeedImages. I imported/exported quite a few times since using the custom build, so I suspect import/export might have made the problem worse.

How can I mark all episodes I have already listened to as read if I know which episode I listened to last?

Example:
The Podcast ""WDR 5 Das philosophische Radio"" has 50 episodes and the last one I listened to was ep 34.
I want to mark ep 34 and all eps before that as read. The only way I found was to manually select all 34 eps individually and mark them as read, right?

Since I have multiple such podcasts and with hundreds of episodes I used the db import export function and marked them read via SQL:

    UPDATE FeedItems SET read = 1 
    WHERE feed IN (SELECT id FROM Feeds WHERE title = 'WDR 5 Das philosophische Radio')

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,How to get to an updated logo/icon?,[],"Given the many proposals in different issues (#1281; #1521; #2124; #2620), I think it's safe to assume many of us developers and active users would agree that AntennaPod can use an updated logo. But how to get there?

From the [Open Source Design blog](https://opensourcedesign.net/open-source/communities/collaboration/tools/design/2017/03/27/osd-needs-better-collaboration-tools.html) (reading recommendation!):

> Design is about understanding, facilitation and collaboration between all the relevant stakeholders. This is why I consider collaboration tools to be so important to design. … However, open source design is at such an embryonic stage that even something as fundamental as a dedicated area for discussion and idea exchange to bootstrap the movement does not exist. This is why I have tried to identify our immediate needs, so that a more suitable tool than GitHub Issues or StackExchange can be found.

The conclusion: such super-tool doesn't exist yet. Meaning: we'll have to stick to current tools. Meaning: we'll have to use GitHub and possibly other tools to get us a new logo.

As we haven't gotten anywhere so far (despite good will), maybe we'll have to get consensus on a proper **process** that will land us a nice updated logo, rather than everybody throwing in their own design. (I'm guilty on that one)
_What (re)designs do we want/need? If we need a colour palette, how do we decide upon one? How do we get to a new logo design? Is there going to be a voting procedure and if so: how?_

Here's a proposal, adapted from https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1281#issuecomment-150530437:
1. prepare an 'assignment' based on previous designs and comments
2. find one or a couple of open source designers that are willing to help
3. ask them to prepare one to four drafts, in a process with user feedback from our communities (GitHub, Google Group)
4. have a vote via an in- or through-app vote

Steps 1, 2, and 4 could each be supported by their own ticket to limit the mess."

As far as I can tell, there's no way to assign multiple headset button presses for fast forwarding or rewinding. Most music players allow to double press the headset button to skip to next song and triple press to skip to the previous one, so I assume it's a system-level setting that treats multiple presses as ""media next/media preview"" actions. It would be nice to see AntennaPod use do that too instead of just play/pause with a single tap.

**Expected behaviour**:
When automatic feeds update is scheduled to happen, and network is available, it should happen.

**Current behaviour**:
Intermittently, feeds update does not happen. There is no error visible to end users.
From logging, it seems that Android intermittently incorrectly reports that network is blocked, even though it is connected.

Frequency of feeds failing to update: ~30%, on a few different wifi networks.


**Environment**: 
- Restricting background mobile data connection does not matter:
I've restricted AntennaPod from using mobile data connection in background using system cellular data usage settings. However, I've also tried not restricting background mobile data connection. The result is the same.

**Stacktrace/Logcat**: 

It seems that on my particular device, when `FeedUpdateReceiver.onReceive()` is called upon feeds update, intermittently `NetworkUtils.networkAvailable()` incorrectly returns false. AntennaPod then silently does nothing.

More specifically, Android incorrectly reports that the network is blocked upon `FeedUpdateReceiver.onReceive()` intermittently. 

In my custom build, I modified `FeedUpdateReceiver.onReceive()` to make an additional `NetworkUtils.networkAvailable()` call after 1-5 seconds delay, somehow then it correctly reports network is available.

It'd be great to have an option of 12 hours after finishing. 

The use case: 
1. I schedule my feeds to be refreshed daily 8am in the morning, I'd like AntennaPod cleanup played episodes (of the day before) so that it automatically downloads new episodes after the feed refresh.
2. I also want to keep the played episodes around for a short while (sometimes I go back to a played episode to re-listen specific segments, typically within a few hours). 

The existing Episodes Cleanup options are not suitable:
- ""1 day after finishing"" is too long: the majority of the played episodes were played the evening of the day before, say, 5-7pm. With ""1 day after finishing"" option they are not eligible for cleanup for the feed refresh 8am the next morning.

- ""After finishing"" is too soon: The episodes get cleaned up whenever auto-download kicks in. In other words they might get cleaned up even soon after an episode is played, if auto-download happens to kick in.

Recently had the ""all media and feeds disappeared"" (2463) issue.   Second time I've seen it.  But this time I am having difficulty re-creating my feeds.  

When I added subscriptions back, only some feeds worked.  In at least one case, I had audio problems (like it was trying to play back two shows at once).   Clicking the ""delete"" on the episode gave a failure error, followed by a suggestion that restarting may help (it didn't).   I couldn't make things work well, so I tried to uninstall completely.  (At which point ""Clean Master"" kicked in and said it removed some unused files).

I then do the following:
* Install Antennapod
* Open Antennapod
* Settings: Choose Data Folder: Select SD card path
* Subscriptions: (pick any podcast): Subscribe
* Attempt to download podcast.  Generates ""Request Error"" that says ""Failed to access external storage"".

Was working fine last week before the loss of the feeds.  I assume I've got it confused somehow about the storage directory, but I don't know how to reset it.  If I flip it to internal, I can get it to download, but I have no space there.

I cannot (and do not want) to reproduce it. Here is the setting:

- I added them to the queue (long press on each)
- I switched to the queue, went all the way to the bottom, put them at the top (long press on each), then back to the top and I put them right after the currently playing episode
- realizing it would be better to always put new episodes at the top, I went to preferences and changed that preference
- going back to the podcast list, nothing was longer there: 0 episode, 0 subscribed podcast, empty queue. The only thing remaining was the currently playing episode (I could listen to it although it was not in the queue nor in the list of episodes)
- I tried quitting AntennaPod and starting it again, no change
- I tried rebooting the phone, the only change was that there no longer was a currently playing episode, so the database was basically completely empty
- there was no crash log

I wanted to put forward a couple of suggestions and see what the better idea may be.

One idea is that after a database import, AntennaPod should run through all episodes marked as 'downloaded', and conditionally test and mark whether the file is on disk or not.

The other option is a button in the settings menu to run this process and check the integrity of the database in terms of whether the files marked as downloaded are actually on disk.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,"Android Auto: after reconnecting the phone to the car, playback can't be resumed.",[],"**App version:**
Checked in two versions:
 * 1.6.4.5 (from Play store)
 * 1.6.4.1-165-gc13acc62 (built from git)

**Android version**: 8.1.0

**Device model**: Nexus 5X

**Expected behaviour**:

After I reconnect the phone to Android Auto, AntennaPod shows the last item that was being played. Pressing ""play"" should resume playback.

**Current behaviour**:

After I reconnect the phone to Android Auto, AntennaPod shows the last item that was being played. However, pressing ""play"" does nothing.


**First occured**: ~2 months ago

**Steps to reproduce**:

Note: this is reproducible both with DHU and with an actual car. See [1] for DHU installation requirements.

1. Connect the phone to Android Auto.
2. Start playing back a podcast (for example, the first item from the Queue).
3. Without pausing the playback, disconnect Android Auto (pull the USB cable, or Alt-F4 the DHU).
4. Reconnect the phone to Android Auto.

At this point the home screen shows the last podcast.

5. Press the ""Play"" button. Note, that nothing happens.

Note, that choosing an item from the list works correctly.

[1] https://developer.android.com/training/auto/testing/index.html

**Environment**: vanilla settings, cleanly installed AntennaPod. Reproducible both in DHU and an actual car.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Feature: open episode on fyyd.de,[],"[Fyyd](https://fyyd.de) is a podcast directory and episode recommendation platform. You can add episodes to a personal feed which can then be subscribed to by others. Currently sharing an episode starting from AntennaPod is quite painful, you would have to search for the episode in your webbrowser manually (or maybe use the [bookmarklet](https://fyyd.de/bookmarklet), but that has it's own problems on mobile browsers).

A menu item to open the visible episode on Fyyd would enable recommending episodes with a few taps.

If I read the [bookmarklet page](https://fyyd.de/bookmarklet) correctly, you can have Fyyd search for an episode by the episodes website URL:

    'https://fyyd.de/search-url/'+base64(episode_website_url)+'/0'

Sharing with one button press is possible, but for that AntennaPod would need settings for the Fyyd username and feed slug.

**Con:** more interface clutter, not sure how many users would be helped by it."
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Forward button skips always on,"[Label(name=""duplicate"")]","**App version:** 1.6.4.5 (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 8.0

**Device model**:Galaxy 8

**Expected behaviour**:Forward button jumps 20s as set in settings.

**Current behaviour**:Forward button skips episode irregardless of settings.

**First occured**: About the same time android updated to 8.0, a few weeks ago. 

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Turn off ""Forward button skips"" option.
2. Try to jump forward in playback.
3. The app skips the episode.

**Environment**: No settings change from standard. Bluetooth headphones. The exact same equipment and environment worked before.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Sort Playlist Randomly,[],"**App version:** 1.6.4.5 (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 6.0.1

**Device model**: Xiami Redmi 4

**Expected behaviour**: 
In the Playlist there should be an option to sort the entries randomly.

**Current behaviour**:
Only sort by Date, Length, Title and Name of podcast are  available. (Datum, Dauer, Episodentitel und Podcastname in german).

**First occured**: unknown

**Steps to reproduce**: 
1. have multiple items in the playlist, 
2. open menu (three dots), 
3. select sort

**Environment**: irrelevant

**Comment**:
This is a feature request. In Issue #2360 it was mentioned that this feature was already requested, but I couldn't find it. In issue #2228 a random playlist is one point in expected behaviour but some other topics are also mentioned."
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Do not charge manual downloads for episode memory,[],"**App version:** 1.6.4.5

**Android version**: 7.0

**Expected behaviour**: Given that I have manually downloaded podcast episodes, that should not influence whether number of automatically downloaded episodes is exceeded or not.

**Current behaviour**: Since I have manually downloaded several episodes, I receive no more automatic downloads since the number of episodes to store is exceeded.

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Set a certain number of episodes to keep and enable automatic downloads.
1. *manually* download more than these episodes.

**Environment**: Auto download enabled. Auto deletion enabled. Finite number of episodes to keep.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Only write queue order to database on drag release for podcast queue.,[],"This prevents large numbers of db writes in quick succession. This is a particular problem for large queue lengths. Fixes #2562 and potentially fixes #2573

Feedback and suggestions for improvement welcome."

**Android version**: 8.1.0 [Please mention if you are using a custom rom!]

**Device model**: google pixel

**Expected behaviour**: stops when deleted, or stops if another podcast starts.

**Current behaviour**: podcast keeps playing.  If you try to play another podcast, both play simultaneously.  Easiest way to stop seems to be to restart the phone!

**First occured**: has happened previously (many months ago) and at this time lead to the application crashing.  I have not waited long enough for it to crash recently.

**Steps to reproduce**:
 1 select a podcast from the menu
. 2start playing a downloaded eppisode
. 3 press on the title to bring up the details of the podcast 
4 delete it (bin icon). 
 5 podscast still plays. 
 6. Find another episode and start playing it.
  7. Both play concurrently.

**Android version**: 8.1 (CopperheadOS)

**Device model**: Nexus 6P

**Expected behaviour**:
When connected to a VPN on Wi-Fi, download episodes without further confirmation, just as with any Wi-Fi connection.

**Current behaviour**:
When connected to a VPN on Wi-Fi, AntennaPod asks to Confirm Mobile Download.

When confirmed, download still takes place via VPN/Wi-Fi. (At least as far as I can tell. I tested by switching off mobile data).

I tested with the OpenConnect and AnyConnect VPN apps.

**First occured**: I don't remember, but this seems to be around for a while now, at least half a year I guess.

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Connect to Wi-Fi
1. Connect to VPN (I used OpenConnect and AnyConnect)

However, there is one feature I quite liked in other players: Showing the progress of the currently playing episode in the notification, either as a progress bar or as a ""time played/percentage played"" label.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"FR: add ""Mark as seen"" to context menu in Episodes > New tab",[],"**App version:** 1.6.4.5

In Episodes > New tab, one can remove an episode from the tab by swiping left.

Proposal: expose the feature in the context menu (the one when long-pressing the episode) as well.

Rationales:
1. The feature via swiping left is somewhat hidden.
2. Swiping left is not quite reliable: AntennaPod often confuses the swiping between mark as seen and going to All tab

Exposing it to the context menu would solve the above issues.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,FR: Provide share Link in episode playback screen even when there is no episode link.,[],"This is a follow up to #2142 . 

In episode playback screen, if the episode does not have link (in the feed), the current behavior is that Share Link menu item will not be shown.

Proposal: still provide Share Link menu item, In the actual sharing, it supplies the podcast website as a substitute for the episode link: 
```
<podcast name>: <episode name>
<podcast website>
```

The idea is that, in lieu of a link to the episode, the share will provide a link to the podcast along with the episode name. The information will still help users to access the episode.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Intermittent Bug: playback cannot be stopped without restarting the device,[],"**App version:** 1.6.4.5 , Google Play

**Android version**: 7.1

**Device model**: Moto E4

**Current behaviour**:
Occasionally, while playing an episode, it cannot be stopped. I tried the following:
- pressing stop button has no effect
- close AntennaPod has no effect
- play another episode: the new episode would play, but the one I tried to stop would still be playing. 

It is as if the playback (the one cannot be stopped) are running independent of AntennaPod. 

The only way to fix the issue is to restart the device.

**Frequency**: It happened intermittently - more than once a month but probably less than once a week, with daily playback about 2 hours 

**First occurred**: I noticed in 1.6.4.5 as described above. It might have occurred in earlier 1.6.4.x releases but I am not sure.  I definitely could say I did not encounter the error in using 1.6.2.3 (and prior) with an older Samsung device (Android 4.1.2)

**Android version**: 7.1

**Device model**: Moto E4

**Current behaviour**:
With automatic download enabled, when I refresh the feed (Episodes screen > refresh button), AntennaPod:
1. refresh the feed (and add new episodes to the screen), and **concurrently**, 
2. download latest podcasts (per automatic download setting) available **prior to** the feed refresh.

Net Result: the latest episodes are not downloaded. Instead the ones available before the refresh are loaded instead.

For example, 
- if the feed currently has episodes: `podcast123, podcast456, podcast789, ......`
- after clicking the refresh button, 
    - new episodes `podcastABC, podcastDEF` are added, but
    - the slightly older episodes, `podcast123, podcast456` are downloaded instead.

**Expected behaviour**:
Using the above example, I'd like to see `podcastABC, podcastDEF` are downloaded instead.

**Android version**: 7.0

**Device model**: Samsung A5

**Current behaviour**: I've been using AntennaPod almost daily, for some years. I updated to 1.6.4.5 a few weeks ago. I had about 30 feeds with about 300 episodes downloaded and in my queue. Today I opened the app to find no feeds and nothing in my queue. All of the downloaded episodes are still on my phone but not visible in AntennaPod (I can use a music player to play them for example) and all of my settings/options are still there. The only thing I can think it might be, is within the last week I changed the storage location to be my SD card, so episodes were spread between internal and external storage. Is there any way to recover from this rather than having to re-download everything? If I re-add a feed and download an episode that is already downloaded, it downloads the file again despite it already being on the phone in the expected location.

**Expected behaviour**: Auto update and download by set interval, currently 1 hour. 

**Current behaviour**: Starting updating and the updates hangs with a ""Downloading podcast data"" in the notification. It hangs until I kill AntennaPod. This doesn't happen all the time but most often all the time. 

**First occured**: A few months back. Not sure which version. 

**Steps to reproduce**: Set to update every hour with auto download and wait until an update hangs. The current update has hung for 6 hours. It would be good to be able to kill the hung update process from the notification. Currently I have to go to the app in Settings to kill it. It will not die by itself.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Drag episode order bug,[],"**App version:** 1.6.4.5 (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 7.1.2 [(OpenKirins Ressurection Remix for Huawei P9)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/p9/development/rom-t3606185)

**Device model**: Huawei P9

**Expected behaviour**: After hitting the padlock button, dragging episodes should rearrange them; leaving episodes where they were left on touchup.

**Current behaviour**: Whilst dragging episodes appears to work, after changing activity and switching back to play queue the episodes are in an entirely different order. To get the desired order I find myself having to switch between activities to dismissed the cached data and see the true positions of episodes. Sometimes, however this doesn't do the trick and I have to close and reopen the app. It appears to somehow be losing where I'm dropping episodes somehow; this makes setting an order for my queue very frustrating, especially as I currently have 56 episodes queued!

**First occured**: Version 1.6.4.5 / Some time this week

**Steps to reproduce**:

I'm not sure, as I can't recall what triggered this.

**Environment**: Pretty much standard, I sync to gpodder.net, but that's about it.

I have some experience with Android Dev, so I'm happy to look at diagnosing the problem better, however before doing so, is there any way of exporting the current state of my app (playback position of episodes, current queue, etc.), as losing this would be really inconvenient!

Note that the same symptoms are outlined in #2573 "

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Feature request: allow episode to be played while downloading is in progress,[],"Hello,

It would be very nice if Antennapod would allow an episode to begin playing before it has finished downloading. The UI implications of this are pretty obvious and the only problem I can imagine is how to handle the situation where the playing catches up with the downloading - presumably pausing the playback would be good enough, though auto-resume once enough additional content had been downloaded would be even better.

Thanks!"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Getting File Type Error on previously working podcast feed,"[Label(name=""wontfix"")]","---
For a few years I have been listening to the Manager Tools podcast on AntennaPod.  For some reason just before Christmas it stopped working and reports File Type Error.

Trying to download previous podcasts that I ave listened to successfully also now fail with the same error message.

No other feeds are affected.

I have looked at the RSS feeds and the only difference I can see is that the type=""audio/mpeg"" attribute appears before the URL rather than after it, but this is probably a co-incidence.


The feed can be found here:  https://files.manager-tools.com/files/public/feeds/manager-tools-podcasts.xml

I really like AntennaPod, but what I really miss is to be able to send Podcasts to my Samsung Gear Sport watch, maybe directly out of AntennaPod (Send/Sync feature) - then I could listen to podcasts while running without my phone.

As a workaround solution, the Samsung Gear app could be used to send the files. Unfortunately the Gear App does not allow sending any file on the phone, but only specfic content like music. 

See https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-s2/713215-anyway-sync-podcasts.html how you can work around this when using Pocket Casts by setting the storage location to the music folder. Maybe AnntennaPod could provide such a feature too? Either by allowing to enter a real custom location, or by making the music folder available as an option.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Playback starts at beginning of track if seeking past half-way,[],"**App version:** 1.6.4.2 (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 8.0.0

**Device model**: OnePlus 3

**Expected behaviour**:

Seeking to any time in the track plays the track from that time

**Current behaviour**:

Seeking to a time in the first half works fine (i.e. a time before half the length), but seeking to any time in the second half starts playback from the beginning of the track. The progress bar continues as if the seeking was correct. E.g., a 1:20:00 duration track, I seek to 00:45:00, the track will play from the beginning, but the duration indicated will carry on counting from 00:45:00.

If you seek to a little before half way and play through the halfway point, there's no issue.

**First occured**: I think this happened when I upgraded android, not entirely sure. It sounds like point 4 in #2487 but I think the version I have has the #2468 fix.

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Subscribe to [this feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:137742111/sounds.rss): 
2. Download any track, play.
3. Seek to different locations, try near the beginning, near the middle and near the end.

**Environment**: This happens with any headphones or playing through phone speaker. It also happens if I turn off bluetooth headphones in the second half of an episode (I guess that causes a re-seek) but not if I switch audio sources on the OS level, through the notifications drawer.

This happens with sonic player turned on or off.

**Current behaviour**: Sometimes a file does not stop playing, or attempting to stop playback is unresponsive. At this point, it is possible to have a file playing in the background (not able to stop) and a file playing in the foreground (able to stop).

The following is a video demonstrating the bug and how to reproduce it.

Steps:
1. Play a file
2. Open the view showing details about the current file playback.
3. Let the file end playing, or fast forward to the end of the file to reproduce quicker
4. Goto 1 until the current file has a duration of 0:00.

You will note that the attached video starts to show odd behavior around 1:33. At that point, a loaded podcast is reporting a maximum duration of 0:00. When this happens, the playback cannot be stopped unless the application is force stopped. While in this state the pause button does not work. However, if a different file is selected for playback there are then two files playing.

**Environment**: No devices are attached during this, such as bluetooth headset or headphones. The application is configured to Auto Delete when playback completes.

**Stacktrace/Logcat**: 
As mentioned in https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/2356 the F-Droid build does not contain logs. I did capture logs during the demo, but they are expected to not contain any AntennaPod logs.

Hello, I've got a recurring problem I can't seem to find anything about, though I might not know what I'm looking for.

The error is 'unsupported Feed Type: Invalid type' and the podcast listed is http://rmc.fr  I have no idea what that is or how to get rid of it.

There are always some podcasts that show the image at once, and many where it's just a gray box. Often the gray box fills with the image after a (long) while, but not always. This annoys me especially when I'm showing my subscriptions to friends and I want to reccomend AP to them. It gives a bad first impression, much worse than the actuall experience really is.

**Expected behaviour**: After an episode is removed from the queue, it should be deleted.

**Current behaviour**: I started receiving warnings from the Google app updater, saying I didn't have enough space left on my device to install updates. Using the Android storage analyzer, it found that apps were consuming most of my storage, and that AntennaPod was consuming 10GB by itself. I wasn't sure why AntennaPod would be consuming so much, since I hadn't downloaded that many podcasts, and I have ""auto-delete"" enabled, so I thought downloaded  podcasts that I've listened to or removed from my queue unlistened, would be auto-deleted.

However, this doesn't seem to be the case. I used the app SSHelper to ssh into my phone, and cd'ed to `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/de.danoeh.antennapod/files/media`, where AntennaPod says it keeps all its data. And sure enough, in the folders for the podcasts whose episodes I've either listened to or have removed from my queue, there are a ton of files, some dating back months.

Until this bug is fixed, as a workaround, can I delete this entire directory, or will that destroy Antennapod? There seems to be a folder for every podcast I've ever listened to, even ones that I unsubscribed  from and removed from Antennapod. Why is it not deleting those folders?"

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,So many problems since Andriod 8 update on Nexus 5X,[],"I have the Nexus 5X running Android 8.0 and antennaPod 1.6.4.1 . Did a factory reset and only have a couple other non factory apps installed. First let me say I tried all the podcast players out there and this was by far the best. I really loved this program until recent and wish I hadn't updated to android 8. Today it just got so bad I couldn't take it anymore thats why I'm opening a bug report. So many problems I don't know where to start.

1  Randomly just starts playing when plugging into the charger 
    Randomly starts playing if I let call go unanswered while plugged in to charger
    Randomly starts playing after using the camera and then turning screen off and putting in pocket.

2  Sometimes starts up playing multiple pod casts at the same time including the last podcast I listened 
  to thats marked as played and shows download only.  Update - Today when it began to play on its own 
  I discovered that it was playing the same episode over top of itself.  The episode began simultaneously 
  playing from where I left off and also from the very beginning. How can that even happen? 

3  Today it just started playing when I turned the display off and I couldn't shut it off. None of the 
  playback control buttons would respond and it continued to play even after I closed all programs. I had 
  to open up android settings, all apps, and manually stop antenna pod to get it to shut down.

4  Sometimes when restarting an paused episode the playback will start completely over at the very  
  beginning instead of where I left off.

5  This problem has me even more confused because I'm not sure whats to blame. The same podcasts I 
  been getting from  Itunes using the same unchanged home network take much longer to download. A 
  podcast that use to take 2 min now takes 30 minutes. Very frustrating.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Share podcast / episod with itpc:// protocol prefix,[],"I often share an episode or entire feed friends over WhatsApp etc.

It would be good if when the recipient clicked the link I sent them it opened in their podcast app if they have one.

## The problem

Currently what is sent is (depending on the podcast in question) usually some web page link to a page of varying quality and usefulness, often resulting in the recipient failing to listen to what I send because it's all too much of a pain, or using the embedded webpage player even though they are using a phone that has a podcast listener installed.

## Suggestion

The Share Link button could normalize the feed url to start with `itpc://` before sharing.

It would be good to choose the prefix with the broadest support, I'm not sure what apps support which.

**App version:** 1.6.4.0 , Commit 7b496d5a (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 6.0.1

**Device model**: Nexus 5

**Expected behaviour**:
When selecting several episodes in succession (so that they download in parallel), for example from a feed just added, they should be added to the queue by the order which they were selected for download, or by the chronological order.  
This is especially irritating when you download a multi-part podcast, and expect to hear the chapters in the order which you have selected them.

**Current behaviour**:
They episodes are added by the order in which they have finished downloading.

**First occured**: As far as I remember into the past

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Add a new feed, or choose one with more than one unloaded episodes
1. select episodes for download in quick succession in a specific order, preferrably selecting the longest episodes first, and the shortest last.
1. Go to the ""Downloads"" screen / ""Running"" tab and watch the order in which the episodes complete downloading. hopefully they will download out of order due to their length difference.
1. Go to the ""Queue"" screen and note the order the episodes were added, and you will notice that they are sorted by the download finish order, not by the download start order.

**Expected behaviour**:
AntennaPod only plays when I ask it to :-)

**Current behaviour**:
AntennaPod will start playing some episode I've listened *and finished* recently. Usually one I've finished listening to. The only way to prevent this is to delete played episodes. Events that seem to trigger this include connecting to a car via Bluetooth Audio, and certain Play Store updates (I don't know if the Antenna Pod pod itself or some services, like the Web View or Google Services).

Because of this bug AntennaPod has started playing in inappropriate situations, such as in the middle of the night and while my phone was charging on my office desk.

This seems to be related to issue #2425, as the episode plays in the same hidden mode that requires killing the app.

Hi,

first of all thanks for Antennapod. I use it daily on my commute and am very happy with it. I recently got the idea of enqueueing my ""short notice news feeds"" in front of my ""long term feeds"". I found the feed priority sorting method in the [Wiki](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Sorting-criteria#advanced), but I couldn't find anything regarding feed priorities or priority sorting in the App. Where and how do I set feed priorities and sort the queue accordingly?

Thanks in advance for the answer and thanks again for the App.

This is a really frustrating feature. Several times, I've gone to raise or lower the volume, only for AntennaPod to skip the entire track, mark it played, and delete the downloaded file. It's really subtle and difficult to avoid, because doing a single volume press doesn't usually cause this, but accidentally holding the volume it down for even one whole second does cause it.

I can't see any option under the settings to change this. Is this a feature in AntennaPod or is it built-in to Android?"

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"""Hardware Forward Skip Time"" button skips N seconds into next episode instead of N seconds ahead",[],"Hello,

I believe I am seeing a bug that first occurred after I upgraded my Google Pixel phone to Android 8.0.0.

I have the ""Forward Button Skips: When pressing a hardware forward button skip to the next episode instead of fast-forwarding"" option Off.

I have the ""Fast Forward Skip Time: Customize the number of seconds to jump forward when the fast forward button is clicked"" option set to 30 seconds.

Before upgrading to Android 8.0.0, while listening to a podcast, if I clicked the forward skip button on my car, or in the TeckNet Bluetooth adapter in my spouse's car, AntennaPod would skip forward 30 seconds in the current podcast. If the current podcast had less than 30 seconds remaining, it would skip to the start of the next item in my queue. That was the correct and expected behavior.

After upgrading to Android 8.0.0, while listening to a podcast, if I click one of the hardware forward skip buttons listed above, AntennaPod marks the current item as played, skips to the next item in my queue, and then starts playing that item 30 seconds in, effectively skipping the first 30 seconds of that episode.

I have toggled the ""Forward Button Skips"" option on and off, and can verify that it is currently off, but this issue occurs. I highly suspect that Android 8.0.0 changed something to cause this to occur.

I would like to submit a feature request that modified the behavior of the ""Automatic Download"" setting.  Currently, if Automatic Download is enabled, AntennaPod downloads a set number of episodes starting from the top of the ""Episodes"" list, which means it downloads the most recent files.

I prefer to listen to episodes in order, so I would like the option to tell AntennaPod that when automatically downloading files, it should select from the oldest episodes first, which would mean downloading from the bottom/end of the Episodes queue/list.

In the UI, this could be implemented as selection from a list that reads:
Download from Episodes starting with
 - Oldest
 - Newest

And you could make Newest the default so that the current behavior remains the default.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Allow setting order (or priority) of podcast to download,[],"Currently it seems when you use auto download and have free space AntennaPod will download the latest podcast episode from all subscribed podcasts.

I propose to have a mechanism in which you can specify a podcast to look for un-listened episodes for in order to download before looking for the latest episode from all podcasts.

Eg. Say you listen to a number of podcasts, A, B, C
A uploads a new episode at 13.00
B uploads a new episode at 15.00
and C at 20.00

I propose we can somehow make it so that if a has an episode that has not been listened to yet, it gets priority over all other podcasts. (This would mean in order to not download all past episodes the user would need to mark them as listened to)

The way I could see this working is either:
- Each podcast has a priority value, higher values get checked first when auto-downloading a new episode, equal priority podcasts can just use the current deciding factor (latest episode?)
- In the auto-download settings there is a list of all subscribed podcasts, users can re-order the list and when auto downloading a new episode the subscribed podcasts are searched in the order in which they appear in the list"

When using a Jaybird Freedom headset, most of the time when AntennaPod skips to the next podcast in the playback list, the audio output is silenced though the podcast is played. You have to pause and restart playback in the app to unsilence the audio output. Pausing and restarting with the buttons of the bluetooth headset doesn't solve the problem. Using a MPow Bluetooth receiver does not show this behaviour.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Connect the Jaybird Freedom Headset
2. Play podcast
3. When AntennaPod skips to the next item most of the time it silences the output.
4. Pausing and unpausing in the app resolves the issue.

**Environment**: 
- Jaybird Freedom Headset
- various playback speeds (1.75 up to 3.0)
- Sonic Media Player
- Headset disconnection/reconnection enabled
- Bluetooth reconnection enabled
- pause on interruption
- restart after call

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Support Android Autobackup for Apps,"[Label(name=""duplicate"")]","When my phone broke recently I lost all my Antennapod subscriptions, play lists, downloaded MP3s, etc. despite having backup to my Google Drive turned on. This shouldn't have happened. All Antennapod data should have been backed up to Google drive and restored automatically onto my new phone.

Note that there should be no extra UI to implement this. The UI is all at the Android system settings level. 

see https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html for technical details. This may be as simple as adding this to the manifest:

```
<application ...
    android:allowBackup=""true"">
</app>
```

Storage is limited to 25 MB so you probably can't use it for the MP3s, but that should be more than enough space for all the metadata. 

This is related to but not the same as #377 which requests the Option to export/import database #377. That is a manual export that could be used to move data to a phone with a different account.

After many attempts the app updates the list with the new available episodes, but it can take up as long as an hour to do so. I know this only occurs on gingerbread as no such issue happens on my newer devices, and I guess it must be related to SSL certificates, since all the other apps refuse to dowload the episodes altogether.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Pubdate respecting smart shuffle,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","Copied from Google Groups:

Hi, 
 
I love AntennaPod and gave it five stars on the Android App Store. 
 
One feature that I often wish for is a kind of ‘smart shuffle’. I listen to (let’s say) five podcasts, and some of them are episodic, so it’s nice to listen to them in order. Since different podcasts began on different dates, and have a different frequency (e.g. weekly, bi-weekly, etc.), when I add multiple podcasts to my queue and then sort the queue by date, I get something like this: 
 
•    Radiolab 1 
•    Radiolab 2 
•    Radiolab 3 
•        : 
•        : 
•    Radiolab N 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 1 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 2 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 3 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 4 
•    Radiolab N+1 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 5 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 6 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 7 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 8 
•    Radiolab N+2 
•        : 
•        : 
•    Fresh Air 1 
•    Radiolab N+2 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 1 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 2 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 3 
•    Fresh Air 2 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 4 
•    Radiolab N+1 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 5 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 6 
•    Fresh Air 3 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 7 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 8 
•    Radiolab N+2 
•        : 
•        : 
This is correctly sorted according to date, but it can result in ‘clumping’ of podcast episodes; something that’s not as pleasant to listen to. A ‘smart shuffle’ would pick episodes in date order from each subscribed podcast, round-robin fashion. This would result in a queue that looked more like the following: 
 
•    Fresh Air 1 
•    Radiolab 1 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 1 
•    Fresh Air 2 
•    Radiolab 2 
•    Thrilling Adventure Hour 2 
•        : 
•        : 
  
Even though Radiolab episode #1 aired (let’s say) years before Fresh Air episode #1, the important thing is that Radiolab episodes are queued in order and Fresh Air episodes are queued in order. Of course, ‘clumping’ would still occur at the very end of your queue unless you happened to have the same number of episodes from each different podcast. That’s OK, I think, because I usually just add all new episodes from each subscribed podcast to my queue. By the time I’ve burned through a significant percentage of my queue, there are usually new episodes, and I can re-sort to interleave the new episodes.  So, though there may be 'clumps' at the end of the queue, I never actually come close to reaching the end of the queue.
 
I find myself manually arranging my queue this way, and it’s very time-consuming and labor-intensive (even more so on a phone). Perhaps this could be an alternate Sort By choice, like “Date, Ascending (interleaved)”. "

I really love AntennaPod and I use it also for listening to conferences, lessons and other speeches while I'm walking, running or driving. 
It would be great if someone can add a simple feature: add a bookmark by shaking the device.

If I'm driving listening a conference, I could want to remember a particular part of the speech but I can't look at the phone or write a note with the minutes:seconds that I am listening to. So a feature could be to shake the phone and AntennaPod ""writes"" a bookmark with the name of the audio file, the minute and the second. 
It would be much more useful if AntennaPod bookmark the current time minus a custom time set by the user.
E.g. I set the ""timer"" 30 seconds before the current position. If I'm listening to 14m 52s, when I shake the phone the bookmark should be created on 14m 22s. If I set the timer to 45 seconds, the bookmark goes to 14' 07"" and so on.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,AntennaPod starts playing episodes in the background by itself,[],"**App version:** 1.6.2.3 from F-Droid

**Android version**: Android O developer preview

**Device model**: Nexus 5X

**Expected behaviour**: AntennaPod should not start playing random episodes in my pocket

**Current behaviour**: After finishing an episode, and sending AntennaPod to the background (with home button/whatever), it sometimes, after a couple of hours, starts playing sound by itself. This basically means that I'll suddenly get my phone blaring in my pocket wherever I currently happen to be. Only workaround so far is to set the mutlimedia volume to 0 after using AntennaPod (so that at least I don't get embarassed :-) ).

**First occured**: Version 1.6.2.3

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Upgrade to Android O Developer Edition
1. Play an episode to its end
1. Put the phone to rest and wait... Sorry, can't tell how long.

**Enviroment**: Default settings, ""use sonic player"" disabled.

Note: since I upgraded to that build of Android, my phone seems to lag much more, and it kills background apps very quickly (I hope the final release is better :-/). This means that the AntennaPod service/process probably gets killed, and maybe restarted for whatever reason. Could it be some state management error, where AntennaPod believes it was stopped while playing (not the case), and attemps to restart when the process comes back?

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Stream/Delete and Download/Play buttons should not share the same real estate in UI,[],"Because I listen to most podcasts at home with wifi, I use the ""Stream"" button often. However, occasionally I like to listen to podcasts where there is no network access, and in this case I download episodes in advance. When a podcast has been downloaded, the ""Stream"" button is replaced with the ""Delete"" button, and the ""Download"" button is replaced by the ""Play"" button. However, muscle memory often takes over and I hit ""Delete"" when I mean to hit ""Stream"" (really ""Play""), because this is the button I'm used to using.

I find the organisation of the buttons non-intuitive. Perhaps the ""Play""/""Stream"" buttons could share the same real estate, and the ""Delete""/""Download"" buttons could share the same real estate. This seems more intuitive, and I expect would lead to less accidental episode deletions.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Feed that contains both video and mp3 selects video,[],"# Problem
Specifically this feed has the issue: http://tv.ida.dk/audiopodcast/channel/16944635

I have been debug'ing to find the root of this issue.
It happens while parsing the feed. First it goes through the de.danoeh.antennapod.core.syndication.namespace.NSRSS20 parser which sets the media to a FeedMedia object with the correct download url. Later during the parsing it goes through de.danoeh.antennapod.core.syndication.namespace.NSMedia which in line 95 sets the media to a FeedMedia object with the video url (from the media:content element in the feed).
When it is done parsing it is left with the wrong download url.

This happens because the ""isDefault"" attribute of the ""content"" element is ""true"".

# Possible solution
1. Would it be a solution to not add the FeedMedia object from NSMedia if the ""type"" attribute of the ""content"" element were video?
2. Alternatively it could be solved by making it configureable which source from the feed should be used for the download.

I could spent some time working on a fix.
Which solution would be preferred? Solution number 1 would gives the best user experience since the feed will just work. I am just not sure if it will break something else. "

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Allow ignoring episode image for lists,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","# Problem description

Podcasts may use different artwork for each episode. Antennapod displays those images in episode list and playlist on the left side, next to the podcast title (and duration etc), which is the obvious choice.

The problem arises once a user has subscribed to multiple feeds, each using different images per episode. It is very hard to distinct the different podcast feeds in episode list and playlist, because there is no visual indication to which feed an episode belongs to.

# Solution proposal

-  Introduce another settings toggle to allow fallback to feed artwork instead of episode artwork
- If the settings toggle is checked, display the feed artwork instead of episode artwork in all lists

When enabling ""move new episodes to the beginning of the playlist"", I think, there are 2

1. When adding an older episode manually to the playlist, it is also added to the beginning.
I think, only newly released episodes found by the feed updates should be added to the beginning.
Manually added episodes should be queued at the end.

2. To ensure, that continuous playing works all the time, the episode should not be added always
to the top of the playlist. It should be queued after the current playing episode. When an episode from
within of the playlist ends, the following episode should be the one on top of the playlist, not the

matches the number of episodes listed in the Episodes area.

**Current behaviour**: The number may not match. For example, currently it says that 105 are available, but there are only 10 episodes listed for download.

**Steps to reproduce**:
I just upgraded from CyanogenMod to Lineage by reflashing the device (not an inplace upgrade). After installing AntennaPod, I restored its files from a backup with adb and set the permissions/SELinux context. Everything works fine other than this episode count is wrong. Is there any way to get AntennaPod to reset this count?

Or does this number indicate something else is wrong? When I store the podcast files on an external SD card. When I first started AntennaPod after restoring its files, it started to download new episodes before it had permission to write to the SD card. I deleted those episodes (in the app) and then downloaded them again after granting permission. I don't know if this could somehow be related -- maybe it thinks there is an episode in internal storage still?"

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Repeating app crashes on Android 7.x,[],"Hi,

i am using AntennaPod on my phone since several month. While running vanialla (moto-version) Android 6.x it was stable and worked as expected - as a result i really love this application as it covers whatever i need from a podcast app.

Since upgrading to Android 7.x (Lineage) i got the impression that AntennaPod is running pretty unstable for me. I found similar problem reports in the Google Play comments concerning Antennapod stability issues on Android 7.

**Some crash examples:**
* App is crashing while downloading new episodes
* App is crashing while playing


**Crashes might happen in different styles:**
* App is silently closed (usually when display is off)
* App is crashing showing an Android dialog that antennapod was closed offering option to reopen it or ignore until next boot (usually when display is on/active while crash happens)
* App is crashing as part of a soft-reboot of the device (usually when playing and display is off)

To get a better impression about the run-times between crashes i'll add an example/excerpt of my today crashes

**Example crash history**
* 16:58 - App closed silenty while playing with display off
* 16:59 - App closed silenty while playing with display off
* 17:00 - App closed silenty while playing with display off
I was wondering if it changes if i do have the display running/on - so i kept using the phone for the following minutes
* 17:07 - App closed with OS crash dialog while display was on
* 17:12 - App closed with OS crash dialog while display was on
Back to having display off
* 17:18 - App closed silenty while playing with display off
* 17:19 - App closed silenty while playing with display off
* 17:20 - App closed silenty while playing with display off

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Image loading is in the main thread,[],"Dear developers,
I found some images are loaded in the main thread in AntennaPod.

For image loading, Google says this:
https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/index.html
"" Loading bitmaps on the UI thread can degrade your app's performance, causing slow responsiveness or even ANR messages.""

I noticed that in the following code, image loading is in worker thread:
https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/service/playback/PlaybackService.java
de.danoeh.antennapod.core.service.playback.PlaybackService.java   run()  (line number: 1159)

However, in the code below, image loading is in the main thread: 
https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/service/download/DownloadService.java
(1) de.danoeh.antennapod.core.service.download.DownloadService.java   setupNotificationBuilders()   (line number: 340 )

I am curious about the latter cases. Why these image loading operations are in main thread? 

Do you think perform image loading in the main thread will affect AntennaPod's performance? If so, perhaps moving the images loading to a work thread can help make app more smooth in user interaction.
Looking forward to your response.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Remove silence in podcast episodes,"[Label(name=""feature request""), Label(name=""good first issue"")]",It would be great if AntennaPod could remove silence within episodes to save some playback time (similar to overcast's smart speed or pocket casts' silence removal feature).
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Handle slow/unresponsive podcast feeds,[],"This is a feature request. For podcast feeds that are slow or temporarily unresponsive, Antennapod currently freezes and becomes unresponsive until the offending feed responds. Even killing Antennapod via Android's task switcher doesn't always clear the issue since it seems Antennapod tries to resume the last download it was performing before it was killed.

Ideally, it would be nice to have some sort of twiddler graphic to show Antennapod is still running, and hasn't gotten stuck due to some low memory issue, as well as some sort of cancel button for the current operation so if a podcast feed is down, you can cancel it and allow Antennapod to skip to the next feed. The app does currently show a progress bar and cancel button when the download or stream begins, but the issue here is happening before the download begins. The initial connection is timing out and Antennapod doesn't appear to check for this and hangs indefinitely.

I track a couple dozen podcasts, and this is making it very frustrating to use Antennapod because if even one feed is down, it means I can't use Antennapod. If I accidentally click on an item for a feed that's down, now Antennapod freezes for 10 minutes until I kill it.

An easy way to reproduce this problem is to setup a wireless router not connected to the Internet, connect to it's wifi, and then attempt to use Antennapod to stream or download a item on one of your existing feeds. The app will freeze and hang indefinitely and not report any status, forcing you to kill it.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Skip and seek with a single set of forward/backward hardware buttons,[],"I'm currently on version 1.6.2.3

I'd like to have an easy way to change episodes in the car without picking up my phone. I can enable the 'Forward button skips' preference, but it doesn't let you go backwards in the queue and it removes the ability to fast-forward (which is a nice feature since my car does not have separate fast-forward/rewind buttons).

My proposal is to support both fast-forward/rewind and skip to next/previous at the same time by assigning one action to a single tap, and the other to a double tap. e.g., If the user presses 'forward' once, then it fast-forwards. If they press it twice quickly, it skips to the next track.

I've implemented this locally to test the idea, and it works well for my use case so I'm interested in what other people think. The double tap works by waiting a small amount of time after a forward/backward request to see if another request comes in. If it does, it skips to the next/previous episode. If it doesn't, it performs the user's original request (reset to 0, ff/rw, etc.)"

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Feature Request: Save to Music folder,[],"**Use Case**: I listen to mostly music podcasts of DJ sets and sometimes want to listen to an episode many times. I would like to be able to save the podcast to my music folder. This is similar to the ""Favorite"" feature in function, but I would prefer to have the files I want to keep long term in the same location as all my other music. It also seems safer and more permanent to me - sometimes I'll find an abandoned podcast and want to save some of the episodes, but I'm not sure if I remove the podcast (since it never updates and doesn't need to be checked anymore) if I will lose the starred episodes when the podcast subscription is deleted. I think the separation makes sense - podcast client is for listening to new episodes, most of which I don't want to save. Music app and folder are for music I will keep long-term.

**Implementation**

1. One possibility I see would be to add the function to the 'Share' functionality. An option of ""Save this episode to Music folder"" would be added. Selecting this would copy the episode file to the Music folder. Arguably it doesn't fit the word 'Share"" very well but since other app share buttons often go to services like Instapaper that provide personal archiving it seems like it wouldn't be too confusing or unobvious.

2. A second possibility would be to make this the optional behavior of the 'Favorite' function - clicking the star causes the file to copied to the Music folder. However, then the question is raised of what to do when the episode is unstarred, and whether the copy of the file in the Music folder should stay there or not.

**Issues**: I'm not an Android developer, so I don't know if the Music folder is a universal concept among all Android versions and flavors. It might require a setting to select the appropriate folder.

Stream resets to last playback time / Progress Bar doesn't<br/>
I've encountentered this bug multiple times in the last few weeks. It is quiet similiar to #1264 and #345 , yet even worse.
What happens: 

- I paused a podcast at Point A, do something else, then resume playing

- it sometimes plays from the last position Point B, I paused the podcast, similar to #1264. 

BUT the progress bar doesn't reset to that position Point B, but continues at Point A.
This means at that point, the actual stream and the GUI are inconsistent.

There are 2 things that can happen if i now skip to a point prior to Point A:
- The whole episode is skipped, marked as finished and the next episode in my queue plays.
- It plays the right point of the stream again

However, regardless if it now is playing  the right way again, if i skip to any point posterior to Point A, it will always reset to Point B again, without matching the progress bar.

If i skip to a point prior to A, let i play beyond A, it plays normally, but I can still not skip to a point beyond A.

I cannot figure out how to reproduce this reliably.  I have seen it happen multiple times so I'm sure it's real, but it's intermittent.  It seems to happen more readily when I've been messing with the storage location for downloaded episodes (e.g., after my SD card dies and I've gotten a new one), which then makes AntennaPod confused about what episodes it should list the stream button instead of the delete button for, which then leads to me button mashing a lot of play commands in to all the episodes to get AntennaPod to resync its state with what's on disk.  My best guess is that the problem happens if I order an episode to stream S then manage to play an episode from disk D before the stream S connects (before the syn/ack gets through?): then S connects and starts playing, but the UI is now attached to D."
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Feature to NOT add new episodes to play queue,[],"**App version:** 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 4.1.2

**Device model**: Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 GT-I8160 (UK)

**Expected behaviour**: When a new episode is published, AntennaPod checks a configuration element to see whether it should be added to the play ""Queue"". Only add to the play queue if this option is enabled, otherwise perform other configured actions, e.g. download but do not add to play queue.

**Current behaviour**: All new (downloaded?) episodes are added to the play queue.

**Justification for feature request**: I have a wide range of podcasts that are configured to automatically download new episodes as they are published. When I decide to listen to podcasts, I want to chose the episodes that I want to listen to which may not necessarily be all the podcasts downloaded, e.g. I may want to listen to some comedy on my walk to the station in the morning but a drama on the train journey home in the evening. I want to define the play list for my listening manually.

**Proposed implementation**: I suggest a global Boolean configuration element, ""Automatically add to play queue"". This could be asserted by default to retain current behaviour, i.e. not change default behaviour of application. It may be advantageous to add a per-subscription option to override the global setting but I think the global setting is required. (My preferred workflow is to have no podcasts added to the play queue by default.) This setting may best be placed in the ""QUEUE"" section of the settings menu. (The settings menu is rather long so it may prove advantageous to add a sub-menu for queue management but that is not the subject of the feature request.)"

I have just started a new podcast − I listened to the trailer and two episodes − one of 44min and the other of 36min − and started a few seconds of another one. I only ever listen at 1.0 speed.

The statistics tab, for that podcast, indicate 3.5 hours. Tapping the podcast indicates « 4 out of 10 episodes started. Played 3.5 hours out of 2.1 hours. ».

I really do not see where these numbers would come from. When listening to podcasts, I very very often rewind 15s or so and was thinking this may me confusing the counters, but for this particular podcast, I listened to both episodes in one go.

Found another example : a podcast where I only listened to the trailer (1.30min) and to the first 15 minutes of the first episode (of 39min). The statistics indicate « 2 out of 5 episodes started. Played 1.2 hours out of 0.7 hours. ». Same, only 1.0 speed, no rewinds, no re-listens.

Since I use gpodder I can probably extract from the API my exact listening patterns of these two examples if that helps.

In the podcast settings, we can precise some terms to include and/or exclude episodes from the auto-download. i thinks it would be nice if there were more rules available (filters on length,size,release date, ...). 

For example, I follow a science french show called ""La Tête au Carré"" where each episode is around 1 hour long and devided into two part : A short one (10 min) and a long one (50 min). The problem is, the short ones parts are also present in the feed and thus are downloaded automatically. To not listen two time to the same info, I have to delete them manually every time from the queue and, then, from the intern storage. 
If I could exclude all episodes shorter than 11min, it would be great.

Where to show this information? At the playback controls, it can be below the speed number, or right above the seek bar. This time can also be shown at the queue or at the episode list, but it can get very confusing, so I'm not sure if it is a good idea."

It can be quite unpleasant to listen to them via headphones -- either you don't understand what's being said, or your ears start to hurt. This is also a health risk.

In technical terms, this is an issue of missing normalization during postproduction of the podcasts, or postproduction for a different target: Attentive listeners with a Hifi rack and speakers can appreciate voices talking softly and shouting alternately, while people with headphones, sitting on a train, jogging, or listening on car audio while driving can not. 

A basic audio effect can go a long way to fix this: We need a compressor, to push up the soft parts, and a limiter, to keep the loud parts within bounds.

There are some quite sophisticated solutions for this, e.g. auphonic. A good introduction in their blog: https://auphonic.com/blog/2011/07/25/loudness-normalization-and-compression-podcasts-and-speech-audio/

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Episodes sometimes skipped and deleted mid-episode with no input,[],"App version: 1.6.1.2 (from Google Play)
Android version: 6.0.1
Device model: Samsung Galaxy S7
Expected behaviour: podcasts should not intermittently be skipped and deleted while partway through.
Current behaviour: occasionally a podcast will be playing, then suddenly the next podcast in the queue starts playing even though the previous one hadn't finished. The interrupted episode is removed from the queue and deleted from the device.
First occurred: three weeks ago
Environment: ""keep skipped episodes"" is on, so it's definitely not that the skip button is accidentally being pressed. ""Auto delete"" is on, so possibly it thinks that playback has completed when it hasn't. ""Sonic media player"" is on. Always using normal (non-bluetooth) headphones.

This has happened to me repeatedly over the last several weeks, with various different podcast feeds.

This issue seems to have come up a couple of times in the past:
https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1644 (issue apparently went away)
https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1162 (blamed on bluetooth headphones but not with much evidence)

I never saw this behaviour on my old phone (an ancient Galaxy S2). Happy to install a debug version of the app to try to catch the problem.

**Android version**: 6.0.1, stock version from Verizon

**Devide model**: Galaxy S5

**Expected behaviour**: Episode stays in queue when starting on Chromecast. Episodes should only be deleted from queue or the device if I have finished the episode.

**Current behaviour**: If you end one podcast while viewing on Chromecast and hit play on the next podcast, the new episode will play, but it disappears from the Queue, and is also deleted from the phone.

**First occured**: I first noticed this a few days or a week ago, but I generally only cast to Chromecast once a week.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Play one podcast episode.
2. Cast it to a chromecast
3. When the episode ends, immediately start another episode (let's call it episode B) by pressing play on an item in your Queue.
4. Episode B will begin playing on the Chromecast, however- Episode B will be removed from the Queue and will be deleted from the device. If I stop casting in the middle of episode B and expect to come back and finish it on my phone later, I am out of luck. I have to re-download the episode on my phone again (if I even remember that I had that episode to finish).

**Environment**: Nothing I can think of.

The Statistics page shows I've spent 5.4 hours listening to a podcast when I've only spent <3 hours. There were three episodes. The first two I listened at varying speeds 1x to 1.4x. After the first two (2 hours), it showed I'd listened to 3.6 hours. The third episode I listened on 1x speed all the way through and it still bumped from 3.6 to 5.4 hours.

I can see this occurring with all the podcasts, not just one. I do usually switch speeds when listening, so I'm mostly listening to greater than 1x speed.

**Android version**: 6.0.1

**Device model**: Nexus 6

**Expected behaviour**: Pause, Jump Forward (30 s), Playback Speed buttons in the 'Now Playing' window and notification window do their intended function

**Current behaviour**: The jump forward button work from one to a dozen times and then stops working, additionally the pause button stops working. This means if the audio is playing I need to Force Stop the app.  The buttons do give the animation effect that they are being pressed when I tap them even though they do not work.

**First occured**: At least 3 months ago, I believe even longer.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Open app
2. Press play beside an item in the queue
3. Press the jump forward button 1-12 times
4. None of these buttons (jump forward, pause) work anymore

Note that it seems I can pause and play the podcast many times and that it is only the jump forward button that causes this problem.

I have tried multiple podcasts that all have this effect.

I am not sure if it is related, but the playback speed should change when I tap it but it does not.  When I long press it, I can see I have selected the speeds I want but tapping it does not cycle through them.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Feature request: accounts,[],"Currently I am subscribed to a bunch of podcasts for myself, but also a bunch of educational ones for my young kids. AntennaPod though gives me no easy to distinguish which should be played, short of only playing podcasts from one source.

Similarly, when I'm sitting on the sofa at home, often I'd like to watch some of my video podcasts, however, when I'm driving, I'd prefer to not be distracted by video based content. Similarly again, when I'm working, I'd really rather only have my music based podcasts playing. In short, often I would like to be able to play podcasts from one group of sources, rather than all of them or just one.

In contrast, Netflix let's me create a separate ""account"" which is essentially just a name, an image and a separate dataset for what's been watched etc. On opening the Netflix app, it just asks who's watching (if there's more than one account) and adjusts what is displayed accordingly.

My request is to set up a similar function on AntennaPod. The ability to create accounts would be done from the settings with an ""Add an account"" button, which would then let users enter a name and choose an image (with a random one assigned to begin with).

I have art/design skills (I'm the lead artist on The Secret Chronicles gpl game here on GitHub) so I'd be happy to help with creating a new set of profile image designs if needed.

Accounts would each have their own list of subscribed podcasts, settings and records of what has been listened to/watched. Each account could also be marked as an administrator or not, which would allow changing settings and adding/removing podcasts.

The advantage of an""accounts"" based ui rather than something like subfolders, is the simplicity of being able to choose a source by simply tapping on a large, easy to hit button on startup, without slide out windows and scrolling etc. My kids can easily open Netflix, choose their account and hit play in a way they couldn't easily open AntennaPod and play a specific podcast right now. Similarly, if I'm trying to get a specific set of podcasts playing in a couple of seconds while waiting in my car at the lights, I could open AntennaPod, choose an account and hit play, where I'd be very lucky to open AntennaPod, pull out the slider window, scroll to a folder of podcasts only 1em high, tap that and then hit play... before the lights turned green.

Anyway, thanks for considering this. AntennaPod is already an amazing podcast client. For me, this would likely evolve it past that, to my family's primary media source. <3

""Access to external storage is required to read the OPML file."" with two buttons ""Cancel"" and ""OK"".
If you press ""Cancel"", the message disappears.
If you click ""OK"", it disappears for a short time and promptly appears again.

Should permissions be added for external storage access?

1. When an podcast episode nears its end, the playback stops intermittently (maybe 5% of the time?). 
2. When I then unlock the phone and open up AntennaPod, the UI does not suggest it has crashed.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Warn users when adding MP4/OGG feed,[],"[following https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/2101#issuecomment-244724762]

Quite often a reported 'bug' concerns an MP4 or OGG feed, while these formats are not well-supported by Android natively. To prevent a portion of these errors, it might be good to warn users when they try to add an OGG or MP4 feed.

When adding a feed by tapping on ""Subscribe"", it could check the filetype of the latest episode, and display a warning dialog with the text ""You have subscribed to an OGG or MP4 feed. Android's support for these filetypes is sub-optimal. We suggest subscribing to an MP3 feed, if available."" The dialog should also contain a don't-show-this-again-checkbox, I guess.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Edit feed URLs,[],"**App version:** 1.6.1.2 (from Google Play

**Android version**: 7 (Android N)

**Device model**: Nexus 5x

**Expected behaviour**: Being able to edit the feed URL of an existing subscription

**Current behaviour**: Currently it is only possible to copy the feed URL to the clipboard.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Subscribe to a feed
2. Go to the feed
3. Tap on the (i)  (information) - there are details like URL - but no way for editing it
## Workaround

Delete existing subscription and re-subscribe.

Big disadvantage: all downloaded files are deleted and all the status flags are lost (e.g. which episodes were already downloaded and played).
## Possible Implementation

(i.e. the how): Just make the URL label editable in the subscription information dialog (which is reachable via the (i) icon, from the subscription tab).

This dialog already contains some editable fields like password/username or auto-delete-episodes.

Alternative: add an edit button right beside the existing copy-button.
## Motivation

From time to time some of my subscriptions has feed URL issues, e.g. the author changed the URL and screwed up setting up the redirection. In those cases I would like to just copy and paste the new URL into a feed configuration dialog to update just the URL.

BTW, from a UI design perspective, I find the (i) (information icon) isn't very intuitive. Before accidentally hitting it I searched multiple times in the preferences menu of that tab for a settings item. IMHO it would also be an improvement to add a menu entry to the settings menu (which already has the entries 'refresh menu', 'Flattr this', ..., 'Remove Podcast').

A radio show I listen updates the podcast rss before the airing adding an item with info about the upcoming episode but, obviously, without an url of the show.

```
<item>

after the show airs they update the podcast rss and the tags became like this:

```

I have auto-donwload active and when antennapod updates this podcast it tries to download a file that doesn'e exist and it loop. I have to manually disable autodownoad for that episode in order to stop from keeping popping-up error messages.

The podcast is this: http://www.radio24.ilsole24ore.com/podcast/conti-belva.xml
the show airs saturdays at 10am gmt+2 and the rss is updated usually friday evening without url. It then gets updated again when the show finishes at about 1pm gmt+2.

Here is the rss before and after: [gist](https://gist.github.com/nixxo/84cbcd12a3bc8abe1a12acb5eecf7ab6)

**Workaround**  (Sep 29 2016):
If your device is entry level or has little memory, try disabling lockscreen background in the settings. Disabling lockscreen background probably would alleviate most of the problems.

**Problem Summary**:
- When playing to near the end of episodes (or about to start the next one), Antennapod on my phone crashes intermittently but often enough (ballpark about 10% of time). 
- logcat indicated indicated OutOfMemory error (need to allocate 7.5Mb),  but I believed the device still enough of memory at that point (device had at least 30Mb free memory, though I understand it does not necessarily mean they are available to antennapod).
- The problem probably occurred around switching cover art `OutOfMemoryError` stacktrace shows it is triggered by `Bitmap.nativeCopy()` < ... ... < `MediaSessionCompat.setMetadata()` < `antennapod...PlaybackService$$Lambda$2.run()` 
- It happened irrespective of whether phone screen is on: in other words, if the error was indeed triggered by switching covert art, the cover art was not needed nor in display at all (from end user perspective) as the screen was off.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Note: this request sounds similar to #2118, but #2118 addresses the issue on podcast screen, while this feature request is for Episodes screen (across all podcasts)

Proposal:
- Add a filtering button. From user's perspective, it works the same way as the ""3 dashes"" filter button, allowing users to filter (and show) only not downloaded episodes.
- the UI will indicate the list is filtered: maybe adding circle-i icon to the tab title (the circle-i icon is from podcast screen). 
- Other options from podcast screen (played, not queued, etc.) can carry over for consistency sake. They may not make much sense in episodes screen, but might still fulfill some other use cases.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,filtering episodes,[],"Hi! I love antennapod and am very grateful for the open source app! I have just recently started using it (version 1.6.1.2 on Android 5.1.1) and here are two issues I can't figure out:
1. Basically, sometimes I need to filter episodes oldest to newest first - for listening to history podcasts for example. By accessing the ""3 sprockets"" settings button, episodes in a subscribed podcast can easily be filtered  in any possible way but when I return to the podcast page that certain filter gets lost. Using the ""3 dashes"" filter gives much fewer options. Can't figure this one out...
2. So I proceed to scroll way down to the bottom (since the only way they seem to be sorted is newest at the top, oldest at the bottom) and click on the oldest episode, say ""episode 1"". When that one finishes, sometimes it will continue playing ""episode 2"" then ""episode 3"" etc. which, ok, I can live with. But sometimes it'll happily jump to ""episode 8"" next, skipping a few in between and so on... In other words, it's not consistent and I can't predict if it'll play the right thing or not.

I hope it isn't confusing.

Discussion:
- overloading previous button as rewind should not confuse the user: AntennaPood does not support previous. The Lockscreen Buttons settings only provide rewind (no  previous). 
- the change (in `MediaSessionCompat` object) is consistent with the existing logic in the associated  `sessionCallback` object in [`onSkipToPrevious()`](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/1.6.1.2/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/service/playback/PlaybackService.java#L1529) method's implementation is actually rewind.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Playback event log,[],"Hello,

it would be great if application logged playback events of episodes somewhere (next to the episode/globally or both). The entries could be like:
- Episode X: started playing at position [mm:ss]  on [datetime 1] by [UI/headphones/bluetooth]
- Episode X: paused playing at [mm:ss] on [datetime 2] by [UI/headphones/bluetooth/sleep timer]
- Episode X: resumed playing at [mm:ss] on [datetime 3] by [UI/headphones/bluetooth]
  ....

Clicking (or long clicking maybe to avoid misclicks) on the entry would start playback at the specified position.

Not sure if this log should include rewinds/fast forwards in order to avoid cluttering the log. Probably not worth it in the first incarnation of the feature. Other improvements could include commenting on the entries later or e.g. capturing GPS location of the event.

Why would it be VERY useful for me? Well, sometimes I resume playback (without looking at the position first) and get distracted by something (but don't stop playback). Or better yet, I simply fall asleep sometimes even having no idea that I fell asleep :). So next time I would rather go back to the position where I started and figure out what I missed from there rather than try to figure out the same thing from the position I finally stopped the playback at (which is typically the end of the episode or another episode anyway, so this method is kind of useless :-) )

Think about it, this could also serve as a poorman's bookmarking in some sense ( https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1946 ). You could ""artificially"" pause/resume playback (even better, do it via headphones) to get the log entry when you want to ""bookmark"". If you do not do this frequently, at least for me it is much easier to remember the datetime (that is a global ""parameter"" which you can approximate quite efficiently) rather than playback position which I have no idea about.

Thank you for considering. This would be a KILLER feature for me. Being a java programmer I was thinking about implementing this myself but I have zero Android experience and not much free time at the moment. So it would take quite a long for me.

Thank you making a great open source podcast app!

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Option to disable auto download on specific podcast,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","This feature request is somewhat related to #1077 (Option to auto download oldest episode first). The use case is this:
- A podcast that is ""low-priority"" that I do not want to download it until I have time to listen.
- Furthermore, the podcast is serial in nature, so it does not make much sense to listen to the latest episode without first catching up on the older ones.

If I can disable auto download on the specific podcast, I can then go to podcast screen and download specific episodes (the oldest unplayed ones) when I have time to listen.

Thoughts?

How to implement:
- On the podcast screen, add there is an additional menu item for settings (for the podcast)
- a new settings ""pop-in"" screen can allow the users to disable auto download.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Feature Request: Support for Chapter-Images,[],"### What is a chapter image?

Chapter-Images are basically the same like a Chapter-Mark but have an image attached which could/should be displayed on the device when the related chapter is reached during playing the podcast. 
### Only few podcasts make use of chapters/images. Why should it get implemented?

In general only a few Podcatchers support Chapter-Marks and even less support Chapters-Images. An argument often stated is that not many Podcasts make use of these features but in my eyes this is a chicken-egg-question. I might be wrong but I think most of the time the services should offer a technology first so that users can make use of it.
### Do chapter-images make sense for an audio-only podcast?!

It's right, that he user would have to look at the smartphone/screen to see the image which makes no sense at first since we're talking about audio-only podcasts. But in fact, it's a wonderful feature.

For example here we've a German Podcast where Photographers talk intensively about 5 pictures over the course of a podcast episode (which goes ~2h). It's not mainly about the photo itself but more about the circumstances and situation where the photographer took the picture - still, it's just nice to see the photo they're talking about. Therefore, while listening, some times you can hear a ""camera trigger""-sound which is placed at the position in the podcast where a picture got visible on your device. You don't have to, but now you can have a short look at the screen to see exactly what they're talking about (below you can find a link to this podcast).

http://bildsprache-podcast.de/bsp013-professor-rolf-nobel

I think this is a perfect sweet-spot between audio and video. The only alternative for showing a picture would be to 
- provide a video podcast (which would create a huge overhead for just showing off 5 pictures)
- force the listener to go to a website to look at the picture
- not to do a podcast like this - which would be a shame, because the podcast is awesome. :)

My personal project is a Game Development Podcast - sometimes the topics may be complicated. We'll try to describe them as well as possible with our voices but I'll include pictures when it might help for a better understanding.
### How have others implemented chapter-images?

The pictures would need to be visible within the chapter-mark-list. Here you can see an example of the Podlove WebPlayer on my website (https://gamedevpodcast.de/00/) and how iTunes does it:

https://media.gamedevpodcast.de/tutorial_chapterimages_01.png

You can see the image directly in the list (which in this case is a cat as an example-image). 
Imagine how useful this could be to find the chapter you're looking for - if you know they talked about ""PacMan"" or ""C++"" and the image in this list shows this as a graphic/logo, you don't even have to read through all chapter-marks.

**Important**: As soon as the chapter with the image is reached, a bigger version is displayed. In case of the Standard iOS Podcast App it looks like below: 

https://media.gamedevpodcast.de/tutorial_chapterimages_02.png

Here you can find a list of other programs which support chapter images at least in M4A:

http://gamedevpodcast.de/tipps/#podcatcher

By the way: It's super interesting that not only M4A but also MP3 supports chapters as well as chapter-images. I'm sorry for my long explanation but thank you soo much for taking the time!

Thanks for reading this long text and have a nice day!

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Large MediaStyle notification (with large album on left) is not triggered,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Using Android 6.0 here.

I noticed that the MediaStyle notification is not actually triggered. This has two effects on the user experience:
1. The large album art in notifications, [which looks like this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a7XDm.png), is not triggered.
2. The podcast's album art doesn't become my wallpaper when I'm listening to a podcast.

I found the reason that this was not triggering: MediaStyle notification only supports up to 3 actions in standard-size view aka `contentView` (and up to 5 in `bigContentView`). (See [MediaStyle documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/NotificationCompat.MediaStyle.html).) The app is currently attempting to display 4 actions in `contentView`: rewind, pause, fast-forward, and skip.

I verified, by testing, that reducing the number of actions to 3 does indeed trigger both large album art and album art as wallpaper.

Should we change the behavior of the app so that MediaStyle is triggered properly? If so, we should reduce the number of action buttons. Which action buttons should we remove?

I think it might be useful for some people (including me) to have a setting for a sleep timer which is active always when you start playback of an episode because at least I often forget to enable a sleep timer in the evening and when I wake up in the morning my half queue has been played. This could be set in the global settings. I don't think it would be too annoying to press play again when I want to listen for a longer time, for example in a train.

The conclusion I drew from this is that the app itself must be buggy, so for a while I switched. I lated realized that **other podcast apps do not even allow** the user to have playback control during streaming, probably for this very reason. 

I understand that fixing the streaming issue might not be a priority, but adding this warning, _at least the first time_ the user attempts this, will probably get more users to stick with the app instead of concluding it must be all around buggy.

Some podcasts, e.g. 'Naked Security - Sophos' contain both audio pieces as well as pieces that are just links to articles on their blog.
In this particular one the ratio is easily 1:10 and it clutters the Episodes list quite a lot.
I can dismiss them by hitting the check-mark on the right hand side of the item, but it's getting tiresome.
It'd be great to have a way to only show/allow the audio/video pieces in the Episodes list.

I installed AntennaPod on my Nvidia Shield TV (newest updates) two days ago and love everything about it except for the fact that I can't get the auto downloads to work.
The feeds work, I have a couple of episodes that got the new label and are part of the episodes menu, I have activated auto downloads and everything but nothing get's ever added to the download queue.
The only error I can see is that I am using an external hard drive as my internal storage and AntennaPod is showing ""/storage/emulated/0 [Error free]"" when I want to select the main download folder.
However, I can manually download episodes with AntennaPod so this seems kind of working anyway and other podcatchers are auto downloading just fine (just don't want to use them because they work with weird filenames).
I would be very happy if anyone could give me a hint on how to fix that or if this is something I have to live with.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,hide episode button - 'one click hide',[],"### Proposal

It would be neat to have a _hide episode_ button on **each** episode entry in the episode list of a podcast to be able to hide an episode from the list **with just one click/tap**.
### Justification

Let's assume that there are many podcasts that have many episodes of which quite a few are not interesting to the listener (which is true for me). I don't think it's a good idea and it's also not efficient to keep these uninteresting episodes in the list ... adding up with time. That's why a button to hide an episode **with just one click** would be nice. If there's many episodes to hide, I don't want to have to long press for the context menu and then do another click/tap.

AFAIK currently one can only long press on an episode (for the context menu) to mark it as played or use the advanced menu (to perform actions on multiple episodes), but that still keeps it in the list. Also misusing the _play status_ to hide non interesting episodes would make things more confusing since interesting episodes would also get the _played_ status.
### Implementation

As it currently looks the download button uses the whole height of an episode entry. I think this space would suffice for two buttons:_download_ and _hide_ stacked.

Of course the proposed feature would require an additional status of an episode: _hidden_
But it shouldn't be too difficult to implement, since statuses like _played_, _downloaded_ already exist.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Use MIME types in OPML import intent filter (fixes #1758),[],"Using an intent filter based on file extensions is unreliable: for example, K-9 Mail sends out intents with URI's like `content://com.fsck.k9.debug.attachmentprovider/75a212fa-2aa8-473c-ad4d-e4e86eff0bf7/5` when opening attachments, meaning any `intent-filter` relying on catching `*.opml` files will fail; also, extra dots in a file's path will break wildcard characters in `android:pathPattern`.

Using MIME types is currently the best option available. OPML files are often detected as `application/octet-stream` (a catch-all for unknown types) meaning the intent filter will catch files such as `.nomedia` etc., but I think that the amount of such files a user will come across is small enough that it won't really matter.

Hi,
I've tried many things to see why I can't download some episodes from this podcast before posting this issue to make it more constructive, but I'm not sure which url uses AntennaPod to download them, so I'm afraid I can't help too much. The only difference I could see between a working episode and the others are that the content of the problematic ones uses ISO-8859-1 charset, not UTF8, but shouldn't Android internally take care about the encoding?

To verify if the episodes were really available I've tried another closed sourced podcast client and it could download those episodes without problems, so maybe we can find a workaround.

I've read some of the issues around here and maybe the PR at https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/1938 is related. Should I try the nightly apk?

Thanks for your help.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Indicate ""Marked as Played"" episodes in Completed Downloads list","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I would like for episodes that are ""Marked as Played"" to be easily visible when looking at the Completed Downloads list. I think the best way of doing this is for the played episodes to be grayed out, just like they are when looking at the podcast feed list. I would appreciate the chance to work on this feature.

When choosing which episode to listen to, I primarily choose episodes to listen to from the Completed Downloads list. This allows me to access all the episodes I have currently downloaded, from various podcasts, all on one screen. I also use this screen to delete episodes I have already listened to. Being able to quickly see what is ""Marked as Played"" will allow me to avoid accidentally replaying episodes that I already listened and to quickly delete the ones I've already heard.

I recognize that there is probably a better way for me to do this using the queue and the auto delete function, but this is just how I've been doing it and I think this feature would be useful for people like me.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Changes to media player protocol,[],"This PR changes some aspects of how the PlaybackService works and the way it communicates with the media players.

Main changes are:
- Playable types should now implement `onPlaybackStart()`, `onPlaybackPause()` and `onPlaybackCompleted()`, and before each call the current position should be properly updated (or more or less accurate), so that features such as played duration can work (only matters for `FeedMedia` type).
- Flattr and gpodder play action instructions were moved inside `FeedMedia`, to be executed when playback pauses or completes.
- As such, an item is flattr'd only when playback pauses/ends, as opposed to the previous behavior where it would be as soon as it reached the threshold (and we were checking every time we updated the position).
- This also introduces a distinction on the play actions we send to gpodder, as now we don't send the duration as the position when we skipped (unless smart mark as played applied).
- PSMPCallback changed considerably: now it has onPlaybackStart, onPlaybackPause, onPlaybackEnded, getNextInQueue, onPostPlayback.
- PSMP now must implement `skip()` and `stopPlayback()`, while `endPlayback()` becomes an internal method. `stopPlayback()` (and `endPlayback()`) return a `Future`, just for the sake of tracking the method's execution when switching media players (we want to be done with the old one and its callbacks before starting the new one), as it's often run on a separate thread.
- The transition between episodes is now done almost exclusively by the media players, opening the way for future support of chromecast queues (that's why a callback method to fetch the next episode in the queue was introduced).
- changes to RemotePSMP.
- created default PSMPCallback for the tests.

I had tested it mostly before the free/play flavors split, but hopefully still works without a problem after being rebased.

**Expected behaviour**: If the screen is off pressing the power button should wake the phone.

**Current behaviour**:  3-4 pushes of the button are needed to get to turn the screen on again while Antennapod is open and a podcast is playing. Moto Display is also not working.

**First occured**: Like 2-3 weeks ago.

**Steps to reproduce**: 
1. Play podcast
2. Lock screen and let it play for a bit
3. Push the power button to wake the phone.

**Environment**:  I thought it had to do with persistent playback controls so I turned them off, also turned off the lockscreen background. The issue persist.

I chose to comment out the corresponding lines of code in the free flavor. I think the easiest way to keep both flavors synced is to work on the files in the play flavor, copy-n-paste the new state to free and comment out code that requires one of the proprietary libraries. With the commented out code, one can get a quick summary of the necessary changes without having to go through the git history.

- the publisher changes the url without any forward mechanism/update in a directory (to get the right number one might want to add up two feeds)

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,AntennaPod disables Media Buttons for CyanogenMod's MusicPlayer,[],"**App version:** 1.6.0.7 (from Google Play)

**Android version**: 6.0.1 [CyanogenMod 13.0]

**Devide model**: OnePlus One - bacon

**Expected behaviour**:
When using my Headphones pressing the Play/Pause Button should pause/resume playback in the CyanogeMods default [Music App](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_Eleven)

**Current behaviour**:
As soon as I install AntennaPod the Media Buttons do not work in the MusicPlayer. 

**Steps to reproduce**:

I think the problem lies in this part of the AndroidManifest.xml file:

https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L31

```
android:exported=""true"">
```

As soon as I start AntennaPod this line gets added to `data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml`

```
<setting id=""7454"" name=""media_button_receiver"" value=""de.danoeh.antennapod/de.danoeh.antennapod.core.receiver.MediaButtonReceiver"" package=""android"" />
```

And this disables the Media Buttons for the Music App. Removing this line and restarting my Phone enables the Media Buttons for the Music App until I start AntennePod again.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,add an option to archive media file when playback completes,[],"Hi.

I developped a feature that I miss on Antennapod and I'd like it to be integrated.

The feature is about adding an option to move the media file to an ""archive"" folder instead of deleting it when the playback completes. The file will still be marked as deleted on Antennapod but then the user can safely move/delete the files from the ""archive"" directory.

If you are willing to add such feature here are the key points of the proposed implementation:
- Change the user preferences ""auto delete"" check box into a ""played action"" list (none, delete, archive).
- Replace the ""prefAutoDelete"" shared preference by a ""prefPlayedAction"" shared preference (1.7.0.0 migration).
- Change the feed preference ""auto delete"" list to a ""played action"" list (global, none, delete, archive), no database migration needed as the old values will still be valid.<br>
  It reuse the database Feeds ""auto_delete_action"" field as the played action value, there is no renaming/migration :-/ as there's no easy way to rename or drop a column in SQlite. Adding a new ""played_action"" column will make the ""auto_delete_action"" one obsolete and imho keeping an unused field with values should be avoided.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Possible causes of Hang-Bugs Found,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Dear AntennaPod Developers,
I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing AntennaPod with it (master version downloaded yesterday). I tested the app with a Nexus 4 (Android 5.1) and Huawei P8 Lite (Android 4.4). I found that the main thread of Antennapod calls:

1) android.database.sqlite.SQLiteCursor.getCount and
2) android.app.SharedPreferencesImpl$EditorImpl.commit

frequently when subscribing and opening podcasts. In particular, the above APIs are called as consequence of the two following calls:

```
1) de.danoeh.antennapod.activity.MainActivity.saveLastNavFragment -> android.app.SharedPreferencesImpl$EditorImpl.commit

2) de.danoeh.antennapod.core.storage.DBReader.getQueueIDList -> android.database.sqlite.SQLiteCursor.getCount
```

In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with AntennaPod.

As the developers guide of Android suggests, moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. It is actually possible to move those two operations off the main thread using background threads. Therefore, do you think that the smoothness of the app would improve by executing those functions off the main thread?

Thanks for any information,
I hope I can help improve AntennaPod.

Expected behavior would be, since the previous episode was playing, for the new one to keep playing.

This behavior, in part, was not present before the chromecast implementation, so a quick solution is to make the local PSMP behave exactly as before (so, on start playback, we're only asking to update the media session).

However, when switching from video to audio, this would also occur even before chromecast was implemented, being caused by the video surface being released and calling the media player to reset it. The method to reset the video surface is certainly not meant to be invoked while the current media is of audio type, so a quick fix is to check if the media type is indeed video before resetting the surface and reinitializing the media player.

Final note: gradle was giving me such a hard time today (possibly because I tried upgrading the plugin, which seems to work ok, but then reverted) and so all my tests were not following the changes in the code I was doing, to the point of debugging and the logs not matching and the break points being inside if blocks that tested false. Really driving me nuts...

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Performance Issue of AsyncTask.execute,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Developers of AntennaPod,

Hi, I have found that `AsyncTask.execute` has been used in many places, like 3 times in `GpodnetAuthenticationActivity`, one time in `AudioplayerActivity`, etc.
However, this API slows down if multiple tasks are being executed on devices with system version higher than 3.0 because AsyncTasks started by this API are executed serially on a single background thread for systems newer than 3.0. (This is found in the [API guide](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html#execute%28Params...%29))
It will help to improve the performance by changing `execute` to `executeOnExecutor` to enable real multi-thread execution.

I am a student majoring in Computer Science. We are trying to collect existing bug reports and fixes of bugs caused by specific devices to help detect and fix similar bugs of other active applications.

We have detected that in your app, method setSupportActionBar of android support library v7 is used in many activities. However, we have observed that invoking this method on some Samsung devices running 4.2 system will crash your app.

We have found discussions in in the bug tracking system of Android: [here](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78377). as well as a stack overflow question: [appcompat-v7 v21.0.0 causing crash on Samsung devices with Android v4.2.2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26657348/appcompat-v7-v21-0-0-causing-crash-on-samsung-devices-with-android-v4-2-2)

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Chromecast issue 340 initial PR,[],"Related to #340 

Chromecast support will only be triggered once the user enables it in the settings.
The way it works is that, despite being disabled, all the chromecast support components are activated, but out of reach from the user. And if the user disables chromecast support, it also disconnects (if PlaybackService is started and was connected to a chromecast).

If it's disabled, the only thing that is supposed to affect the normal use of the app is in the `AudioplayerActivity`, where I'm setting the position seekbar to indeterminate whenever it's seeking or buffering (or perparing?). This does not affect the position it shows, just its background.
I understand that, visually, there are certainly better ways to show the user it's doing some sort of loading, but I couldn't come up with an obviously better one given the current layout, and this one was extremely simple to implement.

Also, there was some redundancy with all the callbacks for general media keys, media session media keys and widget key, so they now all use the same receiver and media key presses get parsed by the same algorithm.

About the `updateMediaSessionMetadata()` method, which was only called when either the lockscreen preference was changed or the media changed, I added a callback from the media player to the service to (asynchronously) trigger it whenever the media changed, and moved the preference change listener to the service and have it run synchronously.

It is very hard to understand the DB structure in this way. Wouldn't it be great if we group these so that by reading the code itself, I can imagine the database?

To implement this, we could create a static final class which we call `PodDBContracts.java`. In this file, corresponding to each table, we can create a static inner class which will have that table's field as constant strings. It would make the code more readable and maintainable.

- do implement an 'add podcast' button in the action bar (as proposed earlier by @TomHennen, and [used](https://lh5.ggpht.com/sLp72XsaKvoGkUB8AUx8DaDyUixB6wAl6QWEidaYyuWhMH4dFx_osY0VxBSKFQjmJA=h600) by Pocket Casts)
- additionally implement an '[empty state screen](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/empty-states.html#empty-states-displaying-empty-states)' welcoming users & inviting them to add a podcast
- optionally remove the 'add podcast' tile (no opinion about this)

Another way to do it is to add a FAB (like DoggCatcher [does](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_Vu2xWEG2wbQVn19by09R9dBmLs_tJYZj6vBc6n755Cp3Jv8m0uqK5SDXc1JfbMgMsDP=h600)), but then you'd need to discuss colour and (more importantly) make sure somehow that if there's three feeds on the last row, the last column is visible as well.

It was discussed elsewhere (initial PR, plus #1838), but would like to open this issue to come to a conclusion.

**Android version**: 4.2.2

**Devide model**: Samsung cell phone

**Expected behaviour**: I would like to be able to set a maximum number of episodes (or even better a maximum space on disk) and have antennapod automatically delete old files that I've already listened to (starting by the oldest), when the maximum number/size threshold is reached, WITHOUT having to enable also the ""Automatic Download"" feature.

**Current behaviour**: I've tried to tweak the settings to achieve the goal described above, but currently it seems that the automatic ""Episode cleanup"" feature is only enabled when the ""Automatic Download"" feature is enabled too, am I right? (if I'm wrong, please explain how can I reach my goal).

Now, I'm not interested at all in the ""Automatic Download"" feature (in fact, given my current feed subscriptions, it's an anti-feature, because it would download LOTS of unuseful files); unfortunately this also turns off the automatic Episode Cleanup feature, so that there is no way to have antennapod delete old files automatically, and to avoid my disk space filling up I have to remove the episode files manually from the feed folders every once in a while. Being able to enable automatic cleanup without automatic download would be way more convenient.

@keunes proposed to start a new issue thread in #1795. So this is what I did.

---

**App version:**
1.5.2.0 (Google Play)

**Android version**
6.0.1 | Cyanogenmod 13

**Devide model**
Samsung Galaxy S4 | GT-I9505

**General information**
Syncing of podcasts feeds and the current (play/pause) state of one or more episode(s) when pressing the update button in episodes and inside the tab ""all"".

All devices devices, the cell phone mentioned above, and a tablet (Sony Xperia Z4 tablet same AP version from GooglePlay and Stock Rom Android 6.0 (not sure about the version, can't check right know) are registered in gpodder as cell phone. The devices have also the same subscriptions (small icons of a cell phone on the right of each row for each podcast feed listed in the gpodder website).

**Expected behaviour**
**1)** After starting to stream an episode on the smart phone I pressed play/pause. The expectation is, that AntennaPod is starting the synchronization to gpodder.

**2)** After that I expected to make an update of all feeds (as described above) on the tablet to get the latest feeds updates and the updates from gpodder regarding the play/pause on the same episode.

**3)** If I'm marking an episodes manually as played, or if I'm using the gear wheels symbol inside of a podcast feed, I expected that this state of listened/played episodes will be synced to all devices as well

**Current behaviour**
Syncing to gpodder is very unstable at all. Sometimes the update is working for new subscriptions. If any new subscription has been added with the podlove plugin on a website, this is mostly working as well.  Any edit (e.g. delete of an podcast feed on a Android device) it's not syncing with gpodder. So the change is not present on the website of gpodder or any device.

**to 1)** After starting to stream an episode on e.g. the smart phone (e.g. pressing play/pause), in the status line appears very often the following failure message.

**German (original message)**
1st row | gpodder.net Synchronisierungsfehler
2nd row | Ein Fehler ist beim Synchronisieren aufgetreten: jav..
-> There is nothing else to read

**English (translated message)**
1st row | gpodder.net Synchronization failure
2nd row | A failure occurred during syncing: jav..
-> There is nothing else to read

**to 2)** Same behaviour for the second point as described here in section **to 1)**. 

**to 3)** It's not working at all

**First occured**
I don't know. It never worked at all.

**Steps to reproduce**
See above

**Environment**
Tests within wireless LAN connection. Bluetooth off

Did the gpodder integration ever worked?
Is there a possibility to see more of the failure instead this short message?

For that reason I also asked for the pod.care support #1776.

  - can do some logging if it's needed to figure out what's going on
- <strike>numbers change in a seemingly random fashion (see blue circles)</strike> _Solved with #1845_
  - I have selected ""number of new and unplayed episodes"" in my settings; can't quickly decipher what the random (wrong) number comes from (new, in queue, etc)
  - again: can do some logging if needed
- Nav Drawer item/title 'Subscriptions' remains bold if moving from subscriptions to feed view (expected: make the relevant's feed title bold in the Nav Drawer) (see red ovals)
- menu item 'counter' currently is a sub-setting of 'adjust menu'. With the introduction of the Subscriptions setting, this is no longer correct
  - proposal: move it to the menu, change the description (expand to include the subscriptions view)
- there is no left padding/margin within the tile titles (for 'add podcast' and tiles without image), which makes it a tiny bit hard to read (and just looks bad)
  - proposal: make the left margin/padding the same as the bottom (which I assume is there because of the line height)

- the 'Add podcast' tile should be the last item of the list in the subscriptions view
- since it is possible to add subscriptions via the Subscriptions view, which is displayed in the nav drawer by default, 'add podcast' in nav drawer should not be disabled by default
- <strike>'show subscriptions' should be part of the dialog to set the menu items (which can be called via the menu settings screen and long-press on the menu items), rather than having its own item in the menu settings view [hope it's clear what I mean]</strike> _Solved with #1846_

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Adapt 'apply actions' filter & view,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I would propose a small set of changes to the 'apply actions' view.

Currently, there are two distinct **filtering mechanisms**: one for the feed view, one for the 'apply actions'. They each have their own set of labels and function slightly differently.
- let the filter applied in the episode view not affect the 'apply actions' screen
- merge their strings (see table below):
  - add the 'paused' state filter in the 'apply actions' screen
  - let both filters have the same options order
  - remove 'all' and 'none' options from the 'apply actions' filter (these are already available via the 'select' button (next to the filter in the action bar)

**And further**:
- make it easier to see which episodes one has selected by a button that hides unselected items (so you don't have to scroll through the list to see which ones are selected)
  - button can be eg https://design.google.com/icons/#ic_visibility and [it's off state](https://design.google.com/icons/#ic_visibility)
  - once an episode is deselected it gets removed from the view (with a tiny delay so that the user can see the episode in fact is deselected)
- for visual ease, align the 'select none/all' button in the action bar and the individual checkboxes
- make the 'intermediate checkbox' deselect all rather than select all (more logical since the button has a minus sign)

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Feed refresh not working properly,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","**App version:** 1.5.2.0 (from Google Play), already had the issue in 1.4.2.2

**Android version**: 6.1

**Device model**: LG Nexus 5X

**Expected behaviour**:
On the ""Episodes"" Screen I click on the refresh button to check whether new episodes of my podcasts are available. In the status bar Antenna Pod shows a shrinking number of how many feeds still must be updated. After all feeds are updated it shows the message ""processing downloads"" and after this is closed all new episodes are shown in the ""Episodes"" Screen.

**Current behaviour**:
- My feeds are not updated with this refresh function. Nevertheless an update on each feed still works.
- The message ""processing downloads"" persists. It seems to do something in the background all the time, because my battery is drained. The only chance to get rid of this is to kill Antenna Pod.

**First occured**: Version 1.4.2.2 / about 4-6 weeks ago/
I'm using Antenna Pod since beginning of year 2016. I already had the same problem in the end of January. I reinstalled Antenna Pod (which fixed the problem). About 4 weeks later, it appeared again. A week later I had no problem anymore, now it appears again.

**Steps to reproduce**:
It happens every time I update my feeds.
Before it happened the first time, this issue did not occure. I didn't change settings in-between.

**Environment**:
I'm using Prestissimo.
No Auto-download, Auto-update feeds once a day.

**Current behaviour/to reproduce** (switching on): Have Sonic switched off, Prestissimo disabled. Starting point is the playback screen, enabling sonic via the dialog: 
- setting sonic when playing an episode, tap speed button when still playing AND setting sonic when episode paused, tap speed button
  - the speed button will register the user's action but not display speed, only executes after (pause &) play (correct in the sense actual playback speed and number displayed are aligned); the button remain gray until moving away from the playback screen
- setting sonic when playing an episode, pause the episode, tap speed button
  - the speed button will function (change displayed speed, use correct speed starting playback), the button remain gray until moving away from the playback screen
- setting sonic when not having played sth (fresh start of the app), start playback
  - the speed button turns white & works

**Expected behaviour** (switching off): As soon as sonic is diabled in the menu, the playback speed should be set to 1.00x, button sould be disabled (grey, display dialog) and sonic should be disabled.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Auto Delete deletes episode-in-progress after sd card unmount/remount,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","**App version:** 1.5.1.4 from play store. Haven't yet received an alpha/beta from joining the G+ groups

**Android version**: 6.0.1  (Stock AT&T)

**Devide model**: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge

**Expected behaviour**: Episode in progress remains stored on the card and ideally continues to play from current play offset.

**Current behaviour**: Episode is deleted

**First occured**: Last Week, but that's when I first got this device and installed AP

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Configure AP with ""Auto Delete"" enabled
2. Configure AP to store podcasts on the SD card
3. Add at least one episode to the queue
4. Play an episode from the queue, leaving it paused somewhere in the middle
5. Unmount/remount the SD card
6. Hit Play on the episode - it will be deleted and the next queued one will play if ""Continuous Playback"" is enabled.

This issue is extremely annoying on the Galaxy S7 Edge. It currently has an issue where the SD card auto-unmounts quite often. There's debate as to whether it's a hardware or software issue. Since it always successfully re-mounts, I'm leaning toward some sort of power-saving software issue in Marshmallow. I also wonder if there's something in a recent Android API that AP can call to more completely ""lock"" the file and prevent the SD card from being auto-unmounted by the OS.
I'm guessing that Antennapod's open file handle gets invalidated so that resuming playback then fails (throws an exception?). It then proceeds as if it had completed playback of the episode and deletes it.

In this situation, where playback fails but the current position is nowhere near the end, I would not expect it to delete the episode. Ideally, AP could re-open the file in this situation and continue as if there had not been an error. I don't know if it will be easy (perhaps a specific exception type/error code) to tell that this is what happened.

For now, I've re-set AP to store casts on the internal storage to avoid the re-download or manual delete hassles. Not a solution for everyone.

Hi,

I've posted about this in the Cyanogen forums as well and it seems like the only fix might be factory reset. I don't really understand why this is happening even when I use various forms of uninstall, reboot, reinstall, clear data for the app, but none of this seems to fix the problem I have caused!

I'm not at all sure this is a problem with AntennaPod, but I'm including this bug report here for your information.

Tested files: 
- some episodes in http://feeds.metaebene.me/newz/opus
- https://people.xiph.org/~giles/2012/opus/ehren-paper_lights-96.opus

The files play back fine on the same device both in Firefox and in VLC with full hardware acceleration enabled.

Other formats play just fine.

**App version:**  1.5.1.4 (Google Play, commit f197f0e)

**Android version**: 5.1.1 (Cyanogenmod 12.1-20151213-NIGHTLY-e975)

**Devide model**: LG Optimus G (LG-E975)

**Expected behaviour**: Proper audio output.

**Current behaviour**: The actual audio content is played, but overlaid with loud noise.

**Environment**: Sonic mediaplayer is enabled and Prestissimo not installed.

Would be marvelous if that was fixed as I'm currently working on a proxy which recodes podcasts to bandwidth saving opus.

**Expected behaviour:** Press play button. Podcast plays. Play button icon changes to pause button icon.

**Current behaviour:** Press play button. Button is unresponsive. The podcast doesn't play. Play button icon remains.

**First occured:** about a week ago

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open a podcast and be on the main podcast screen with the audio controls and podcast picture/description. Make sure the podcast is playing.
2. Press power button to lock phone.
3. Unlock phone. You should be back on the main podcast screen.
4. Press pause button. The podcast will pause.
5. Press play button. The button will be unresponsive.

This can also be recreated with the podcast not initially playing, in which case the pause button will be unresponsive.

If you press the back button and then click on the bottom tab to get back to the main podcast screen, the play/pause button will once again be responsive.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,crop / limit podcast list lengths + visual difference for non-live items,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I don't see anywhere an option - manually or auto - to limit the accumulated podcast list lengths in AntennaPod. Some feeds, whose online XML lists are only a dozen entries long or so, have many hundred old items in AntennaPod meanwhile. No manual cleanup command or automatic  algorithm (setting) seems to exist for cropping.? 

Thus podcast list handling & update is getting slower and slower. Its somewhat manageable with display filters, but that does not really satisfy regarding the data pile up problem and regarding navigation. To crop, it seems to require a complete feed deletion + re-subscription, but then the stored newer items get lost.

There is also no visual difference for items which are not anymore ""live"" according last feed XML download - and which mostly do fail upon download attempt. So its always a lottery to try on an older item - and then possibly receipt the download error.

Suggestions (in case I'm not missing a ""secret"" option):
- A manual option to shrink a list to ""live"" feed items + N  (according to last XML feed download)(default N=20); but possibly always keeping even the very old items which still have downloaded media files (and/or are queued/favored)
- Show a visual difference between ""live"" items and only internally archived very old items. (according to last XML download) 

That would do 99% for me. 

Fancy / optional:
- auto algorithm (and setting - globally or per feed) for auto-limiting the feed list length to live items +N

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Reordering episodes in queue causes mis-ordering, crashes","[Label(name=""bug"")]","When dragging episodes up or down in the queue, I often get crashes.  If there is no crash, the queue frequently ends up out of order.  Sometimes merely dragging an episode up or down one slot causes a crash.

I have found at least one reproduction case.  Suppose you start with episodes A, B, C, and D in order:
-A
-B
-C
-D

Tap on A and start to drag down, so you should end up with
B
A
C
D

When A's row gets to where you would expect it to swap with B, the app does one of two things: crashes immediately (I haven't figured out why this happens yet), or the remaining episodes all slide down another row (D pushing into a previously nonexistent row):

-
-A
-B
-C
-D

If you continue to hold and drag A down, when it gets to B's new row, the app crashes.  This reproduces for me 100%.

I also am experiencing some bugginess moving an episode up, but haven't found a watertight repro case yet.  Usually it manifests itself by moving the episode an extra space or two.  Sometimes the app crashes.

I noticed this in the last few days.  I don't remember the exact first time, but I would guess no earlier than a week ago.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Play/pause button can stop working,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","**App version:** 1.5.0.9 from F-Droid

**Android version**: 4.4.4

**Current behaviour**: Play/pause button can stop working after the screen has turned off (after the screen is turned back on of course). 

**First occured**: Version 1.5 (worked on 1.4)

**Steps to reproduce**:
With the current episode in focus:
1. Play something
2. Turn off the screen
3. Turn on the screen
4. Pause (this works)
5. **Play/resume doesn't work**

AND
1. Stop/pause playback
2. Turn off the screen
3. Turn on the screen
4. Press play (this works)
5. **Pause doesn't work**

As a workaround, if you press back you get the currently playing episode at the bottom and the play/pause button there works.
If you focus a different app before turning the screen off, turn the screen on and then focus AntennaPod again it works fine. So the problem occurs only when the app has focus (on the current episode).

**Environment**: Do you still use Prestissimo? No, and I have tried Sonic on and off.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,flattr4j jarfile not available anymore (from wiki instructions on how to Set up the Android SDK),"[Label(name=""question"")]","When setting my development environment following the [wiki instructions](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Building-AntennaPod) I noticed that the link to `flattr4j` which points to http://www.shredzone.org/attachments/download/250/flattr4j-core-2.7.jar is now broken, as you get redirected to https://shredzone.org/index.html

There doesn't seem to be a place where to download the ""compiled"" jar file.

Also, the following is mentioned on the Github page of the project at https://github.com/shred/flattr4j :

> **Important Note**
> 
> Flattr is currently changing its API. Because of that, some of the flattr4j calls are failing or not delivering the expected results. It is unclear to me what a future API may look like, and to what extend flattr4j is going to support it. For the time being, **I recommend not to use flattr4j in new projects.**

So to create PR #1722 I didn't include this jarfile. The app runs fine, but as I have not been using Flattr since ~2013, I can't test the Flattr-specific bits.

Question: Is the Flattr integration from AntennaPod still working, or is it affected by the API changes mentioned above?

In any case, the wiki should probably be changed. The reason I didn't do it myself directly, is that I don't know what it should be changed to:
- either, if the code is broken, remove this .jar dependency (and thus also probably remove all Flattr code from the app?)
- or, if the code is still working, try to find another place where the jarfile can be downloaded from. (I suppose we don't want to ask new contributors to compile that jarfile, I for one have no clue what needs to be done for that, and am not interested in a `git clone` of that project's source code.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Option to Fast-forward instead of Skip,[],"This PR addresses issue #1560, and builds upon PR #1424.
Now instead of only allowing Blutooth hardware buttons to fast-forward instead of skipping (which used to be the original behavior), other users can choose to fast-forward. For example (but likely not limited to this use case) CyanogenMod users that long-press the Volume Up button can now again fast-forward 30 seconds. (long-pressing Volume Down still rewinds 30 seconds).

The change was made by broadening and renaming the option that was introduced for ""hardware"" button presses. By default, the behavior is to Skip (so that it is consistent with the current behavior), but any user that wants to Fast Forward can set this option to False.

This should be testable also for non-CyanogenMod users, either by using a Bluetooth handset that sends the KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT, or by triggering the KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT from the application itself.

I have removed the translations for the old preference `pref_hardwareForwardButtonSkips_title` and `pref_hardwareForwardButtonSkips_sum`, so that the new text gets translated again.

This is my first PR for AntennaPod, I hope I did everything well, don't hesitate to let me know if I need to change things. Thanks for looking into this.

I must admit that even I had forgotten about the possibility to change the speed from the audio settings button, and that I was a bit annoyed that (I thought) I had to cycle through all the options to go down one step, when I actually used the feature in real life for the first time last week.

My proposal: move the selection of preferred speeds to the settings screen. Like the OP, intuitively I would expect a lonpress to draw up a list with radio buttons to set the current speed, with some option to reach/have a slider.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Video player: Delay controls hide on interaction,[],"When rewind, play/pause or ff is pressed, the controls hiding is delayed.
Lowered the general delay for hiding from 5s to 2,5s. (In comparison, in VLC the default value is only 1s)
The position now also updates (e.g. when seeking) when playback is paused.

I noticed that often the current position is not updated because tryLock is false (race condition) and the position is not actually read.
So I added a timeout of 50ms. Really not sure if this is a good idea. 50ms should not be noticeable, but we are running on the main thread here...

After update to newer version of AP, media name in Persian language (right to left) is missed on sdcard and replaced with hyphen/minus. However in-app media name is correct.
By the way, i stick to older AP-1.3.1 and still pleasant app.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Prevent video controls from disappearing while using them,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I suggest a change to the on-screen video controls. It would be nice if the controls do not disappear while using them. 

Currently, if I am playing a video podcast and hit the 30sec FF button (on the screen) several times, the controls will eventually disappear, no matter how frequently I am hitting the FF button. I can be rapidly hitting that button, and all of a sudden they on-screen controls disappear. Obviously they come right back after touching the screen again, but it may be nice to prevent them from going away.

It is good to have the on-screen controls disappear eventually, however, I suggest to keep the controls on-screen for a minimum number of seconds after touching a playback control button. Maybe 5 seconds. Then the controls should disappear after that.

Hopefully I am clear in my description.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Moving to new phone with newer version produced error in fetching feeds,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","Hi!

I do not have apps from the play store set to automatically update, so when I switched to a new phone Antennapod was an older version (1.3.4.1). On the new phone the newest version of Antennapod was installed  (1.4.2.2). 

I backup the application data for Antennapod using Helium then restored it on the new phone. When I tried to fetch the feeds they all produced an **Unknown Error**.

I then tried upgrading the old phone to the newest version (1.4.2.2) of Antennapod and started Antennapod fresh and fetched feeds. This worked. I then backup Antennapod  on the old phone and restored on the new phone. I started Antennapod fresh and tried to fetch feeds. I got an **Unknown Error** for each feed it tried to fetch.

I then tried uninstalling Antennapod on the new phone. Then reinstalling Antennapod and  restoring the data with Helium.  I got an **Unknown Error** for each feed it tried to fetch.

I am not sure how to proceed other than I would need to start fresh and export  then import via OPML or via gpodder.net.

This means I will lose all my downloaded episodes and their status. Correct?

Any other ideas on moving Antennapod to a new phone?

Thanks again for all your hard work on Antennapod!

App version: (from Google Play) 1st time 1.3.4.1 ==> 1.4.2.2  2nd and 3rd time 1.4.2.2 ==> 1.4.2.2

Android version: 4.1.2 ==> 4.4.2

Device model: Samsung S3 mini ==> Samsung S5 mini

Expected behaviour: Moving the data should allow feeds to be fetched

Current behaviour: Fetching feeds on the new device produces and **Unknown Error** for all feeds it attempts to fetch

First occured: Version  1.4.2.2 / yesterday

Steps to reproduce:

Move Antennapod data from one Android phone to another using Helium.

Future methods to read the volume levels (in order to update the seekbars) should use the member variables mVolumeLeft/Right, as long as it's the expected behavior to keep ducking effects away from the user's control (other than ducking becoming possibly an optional feature in preferences).

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,FR: Export & import favorites,"[Label(name=""duplicate"")]","Migrating from one phone to another, it's pretty damn easy to use OPML export & -import to move stuff over. Yet it would be great if also 'favourites' could be exported (given the fact that syncing with gpodder.net doesn't work properly in all cases), so that these episodes (and their feeds, as they can't be orphaned) could be imported to a new instance.

Currently, if gpodder.net is not enabled/functioning, ppl may loose their favourites (and not be able to re-add them, in they're old episodes which may no longer appear in updated feeds).

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,OPML Import: Select all/none toggle,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Currently, when importing an OPML file, 'deselect all' is hidden behind a menu button, and both 'select all' and 'deselect all' are still visible when it makes no sense to apply them.

Proposal: when none or a few (up to all but one) are selected) display 'select all', otherwise (in case everything is selected) display 'deselect all'.

This unclutters the UI, and (at least to me when migrating to a new phone) the only most logical thing to do is to select a few feeds manually, or everything via the button.

The rare case when 'deselect all' is wanted, is (I guess) when a person changes their mind:
A) first thought 'I want all' then thought 'I want just a few', or
B) first thinking 'I want feeds A-G' then thinking 'I want feeds Q-Z' (e.g. in case selecting many feeds manually and wanting to switch to another set.
In these cases users will likely figure out to press 'select all' and then 'deselect all'.

The [podcast feed](http://cms.marketplace.org/podcasts/collections/153961/itunes) itself only defines one instance of each item. Initially when the podcast was added only one instance of each item was observed. Some time later after listening to all item, however, I went back and saw that there were multiple entires for each item. Some items have no duplicates, some appear 3x and some 4x times.

For Marshmallow, we also have to check read and write permissions. This PR does that.
(Without the permissions, we cannot do anything on Marshmallow. So we check for this really early and don't allow the user to do anything without giving us the permission first.)

The Directory Choose Dialog now also has a fancy icon for ""Create new folder"" (showing text really bugged me).

Basically after the update antennapod loads and says 'external storage not mounted' I can't do anything in antennapod.

I managed to fix it both times by flushing the app data, which meant I had to manually subscribe again to every pod cast and download them all again.

From what I've seen online it seems to be where the previous path to the data (which I keep on an external sd card so my internal card doesn't get bloated) is invalid. 

Would it be possible to add an option when the expected storage path isn't found to redefine it?

However, now with the podcast directory on the external storage, every time I mount and unmount the SD card, AntennaPod no longer recognizes the downloaded podcasts (doesn't allow playback and starts to redownload the previously downloaded podcasts) -- similar to how it doesn't recognize podcasts that are placed in the media directory manually. 

Any assistance relating to this matter would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you!

EDIT: Additional Information

Android version: 5.0.2 (CyanogenMod 12-20150308 Nightly Build)

Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (SM-N9005)

Expected behavior: Expected AntennaPod to playback downloaded podcasts after unmounting and remounting SD card,  

Current behaviour: The play icon appears next to the downloaded podcasts, but once I choose to play the files, AntennaPod begins to redownload them

AntennaPod Version 1.4.2.2

Steps to reproduce:
1. Choose external storage for data folder.
2. Download any particular podcast episode.
3. Close AntennaPod, unmount the SD Card and remount. 
4. Open AntennaPod and attempt to play the previously downloaded podcast -- a recommencement of the download should occur.

That is, the audio plays, then at some point the last few seconds repeat. However, the issue is not the playback, as once the file is downloaded the repeating bit can always be reproduced.

It is also possible that when the download is continued from being interrupted the resulting audio file may contain a section which is invalid and sounds like static when played for a brief moment around the section where the re-download occurred.

This can be observed on AntennaPod 1.4.2.2 from F-Droid.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,OPML export saves in folder that gets removed on uninstall,[],"When you do an OPML export, it gets saved in the antennapod folder, which gets deleted if you uninstall it. This is rather unfortunate, as keeping the data even though you're uninstalling the app is rather the point of the OPML export.
Could this be changed so it either saves it in someplace which doesn't get deleted, or doesn't delete that specific file when uninstalling?
As a secondary concern, doing two exports results in only one file. Does it get overwritten? I suggest saving it with timestamps in the name or just numbering them.
Thirdly, maybe you should by default leave some settings and subscription data behind when uninstalling? You make it far too easy to lose all settings and subscriptions.

I went into the menu, afterwards only between 1.0 and 2.0. Curious, I went to look at the specific setting and found a range of 1.1 to 2.0 enabled, all these ranges in steps of 0.1. Going back to the playback view it no longer went to 1.0, keeping to the range in the setting. I suppose something in the update did something strange, or that one time when I enabled sonic for a second. It's so strange a collection of bugs I doubt it'll be easily reproduceable.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Problem with seeking in a particular podcast.,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Android version: 5.0.2
Device model: MEDION X5004

Expected behaviour:
Seeking in any podcast episode should just work.

Current behaviour:
With one particular podcast, I have this problem that seeking beyond a certain position does not work correctly. The Podcast is [Linux Voice, Season 3 Episode 22](https://www.linuxvoice.com/podcast-season-3-episode-22/). When the podcast starts, I seek to a position beyond 35 minutes (e.g. `00:36:54`). Then one of the following two things happen:
- Either the podcast stops as if it was hitting the end of the mp3-file. The next episode starts playing automatically.
- Or, and this is quite strange, the (visual) seeking succeeds, the new display time is `00:36:54` and continues to increase in every second (`00:36:55`, `00:36:56`, ...), but the audio track is wrong. The audio that is played is from the start of the podcast episode (`00:00:01`, `00:00:02`, ...).

First occured: Version 1.4.2.2 / occurred sometime around 2015-12-23

Steps to reproduce:
1. Subscribe to Linux Voice Podcast via iTunes.
2. Download Season 3 Episode 22
3. Start playing the episode.
4. Seek to position `00:35:00` or beyond.
5. Repeat step 4 several times, until you see the above behavior.

Environment (Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. ""Unusual"" devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?):

Of course after the current episode is played. [@cdysthe in https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1414#issuecomment-159448272]

Wholeheartedly agree. Currently, the 'add to top of the queue' option doesn't make much sense: Imagine a line (queue) to enter a concert, where VIPs may enter at the front of the line (add episodes to top of the queue). Then what's the point of having ppl added in front of the line (top of the queue) if you let ppl enter (episodes play) who are half-way in the line (just because they happen to be behind the person that last entered). The logic of a line (queue) I think is: first in line, first entrance (rather than first next person in line after the one that just entered).

Then why still add episodes to the top if playback starts somewhere in the middle? The aim (in my world) of 'add to top' is to make the queue have the most recent episodes first. However currently playback will always end up somewhere in the middle of the queue, and I won't always listen to the most recent episodes first.

Currently I always manually drag & drop the currently playing episode to the top, which is really cumbersome.

Curious to see @mfietz' & @TomHennen's viewpoints. If not standard behaviour, I'd advocate for a setting to enable this (new setting under 'Queue').

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Preference to fast-forward or skip on hardware button not respected with long-press of volume key,"[Label(name=""awaiting review"")]","PR #1424 has added the ability for users to indicate if they want their hardware forward button to skip instead of fast forwarding.

Regardless of the state of this preference, AP always skips to the next episode when I long-press the volume up button on my phone when the screen is off.
It used to be that when long-pressing the volume up, the episode would be forwarded X number of seconds (that time is definable in the preferences). I use[d to use] this extensively to forward ads when driving my car, it's easy as you can keep your eyes on the road and just need one finger to long-press for 2 seconds. Now I can't, as doing so manually requires me to unlock the screen, look at my phone, go to AP (if it wasn't the last app I used), click on the currently playing section at the bottom of the screen, and click on the fast forward button a couple of times. All way too dangerous while driving...

Anyway, looking at the code, I see the following on [line 1259 of `core/service/playback/PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.java`](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/0c973e3ea79d0891cbc1d1ba102878996797205f/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/service/playback/PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.java#L1259):

```
                case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT: {
                    if(event.getSource() == InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_NONE ||
                            UserPreferences.shouldHardwareButtonSkip()) {
                        // assume the skip command comes from a notification or the lockscreen
                        // a >| skip button should actually skip
                        endPlayback(true);
                    } else {
                        // assume skip command comes from a (bluetooth) media button
                        // user actually wants to fast-forward
                        seekDelta(UserPreferences.getFastFowardSecs() * 1000);
                    }
                    return true;
                }
```

I assume `UserPreferences.shouldHardwareButtonSkip()` returns the value of the checkbox in the preferences, but as it is preceded by a OR on `event.getSource() == InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_NONE`, it looks like on my device long-pressing the volume up had an event source of `SOURCE_CLASS_NONE` and the code thus always goes to `endPlayback(true)` instead of `seekDelta(UserPreferences.getFastFowardSecs() * 1000)`.

I've noticed that the PR and the `pref_hardwareForwardButtonSkips_sum` string mentions hardware buttons, but the comment on line 1261 mentions the command coming from ""a notification or the lockscreen"" - maybe a residue from a previous commit? IN any case, I've also tried to use the >| button that appears on the lockscreen, but regardless of this checkbox the player always skips to the next track.

Now I'm not sure what the first part in the `if` statement is supposed to do, but (unless I haven't understood the feature correctly) on my phone it's not working as I imagine it should. The description of this preference reads:

```
When pressing a hardware forward button skip to the next track instead of fast-forwarding
```

The way I'm understanding this is that when the checkbox is not set, long-pressing my _hardware_ volume-up button should fast-forward.

Looking at different bug reports (e.g. #1407) I understand there was some rough discussions around skipping vs. fast-forwarding, with two camps each preferring one of the behaviours. It looks to me that this setting was introduced to appease this, but it looks like it's not yet completely working as expected?

Again, I'm not really sure what the first condition in this `if` is supposed to do, but maybe it could be removed so that the code would do (pseudo-code):

```
    when pressing KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT:
        if UserPreferences.shouldHardwareButtonSkip()
            skip to next episode
        else
            fast forward
```

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,FR: Play next in feed if playback initiated from feed overview (+ reversed feed),"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","I sometimes like to listen to a bunch episodes from one show, just to catch up with the feed after holidays. Currently, this is possible by manually sorting the queue, but I find it quite a hassle to do so. Quite some other users seem to want to be able to play the episodes just from one feed, because they're listening to an audio play, lectures, or alike.

Therefore I'd like to propose:
- to make AP **play the next episode in the feed list when the currently playing episode is finished, when playback is initiated from the feed list** rather than from the queue
- to **introduce a new feed-setting to reverse the order in the feed screen** so that the newest episode of the feed would be shown at the bottom of the list (and new episodes would be added to the bottom). If enabled, I can then listen to that episode in sequential order by tapping on the highest listed (and thus the oldest) episode, after which AP will continue playback down the list (to more recent episodes).
## 

**Feed screen as dedicated queue, change of perspective (?)**
I have the feeling often we as (wannabe-)developers\* see the feed screen as a way to manage episodes of that particular feed, and a way to reach information and settings of that feed. Given the large amount of talk about multiple playlists and stuff, however, I believe many people could easily or already see/perceive the feed overview as a special playlst or dedicated queue for one show, and I think we should adapt our perspective accordingly. When doing so, the proposed makes more sense than current behaviour, regardless the use case. Rather than jumping from one queue to the other (dedicated to general) without any feedback to the user, AP sticks to the queue from which the user initiated playback.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,hardware/Bluetooth FF buttons still don't work properly with v1.4.2.2,"[Label(name=""awaiting review"")]","I am running AntennaPod on a Nexus 5 (`hammerhead`) under KitKat (4.4.4).

Until v1.3.4, the hardware/Bluetooth fast-forward buttons did exactly what I wanted: fast-forwarding by the same amount as I had configured the soft-button.

This changed in v1.4.0, but I thought the old behavior would be restored with the new ""skip vs. fast-forward"" option in v1.4.1. However, this new option _does not change_ the behavior of my device at all.

I think the problem is right here in [PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.java#L1254-L1264](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/service/playback/PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.java#L1254-L1264).

```
                if(event.getSource() == InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_NONE ||
                        UserPreferences.shouldHardwareButtonSkip()) {
                    // assume the skip command comes from a notification or the lockscreen
                    // a >| skip button should actually skip
                    endPlayback(true);
                } else {
                    // assume skip command comes from a (bluetooth) media button
                    // user actually wants to fast-forward
```

Perhaps some devices _always_ have `event.getSource() == InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_NONE`? For me, at least, it would be useful to totally ignore this input source, since I **never** intend to skip to the end of a podcast, while skipping forward and backwards a few seconds is something I do very frequently.

```
                if(UserPreferences.shouldHardwareButtonSkip()) {
                    endPlayback(true);
                } else {
                    // regardless of the source of the skip command,
                    // user actually wants to fast-forward
                    seekDelta(UserPreferences.getFastFowardSecs() * 1000);
                }
```

Perhaps the two-way toggle could be changed to a three way option to support this?

```

    (2) Bluetooth media buttons fast-forward, others skip to next episodes.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"When connected to WiFi that doesn't provide internet connection, download files hang playback","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Antennapod should verify that the data downloaded is the media data.
If connected to a hotel or airport Wifi that require further login, the downloaded file is small, around 1-20 kb.  It is probably the network login screen, but antennapod assumes that it media file and trys to play it.  Which generally hangs the program and it is killed.

A connection with blocking, may also have similar problems, where the blocking message is received instead of the media data.

I suggest two corrective actions:
1. Verify that the internet connection is available, before attempting to download the episode.
2. Check that the received data is actually a valid media file after it is received. If not, don't let it be played.  

Workaround: Look for media files that are too small and delete them from the cache manually.

I also have problems where antennapod hangs when an audio podcast ends, followed by a video.
Again, checking the data, before attempting to play it should allow using the correct codec.  The check should be done on the next podcast in background while playing the first podcast or when it approaches the end.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,OPML import from local filesystem doesn't work,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I re-installed antennapod and tried to import some feeds from a local OPML file but it didn't work.

I'm sure the OPML file is OK, importing podcasts from the very same file used to work in previous versions of antennapod (unfortunately I can't recall the exact version when it worked).

Another small bug: if I repeat the import process, I always have to choose the external filemanager, even if I select ""Always"" in the ""Complete action using..."" popup dialog; so it seems antennapod is not keeping track of the choice.

> I checked in transifex if it wasnt some translation mistake, but it seems it's not. In 1.4.2.0 it seems filtering of 'downloaded' and 'not downloaded' episodes are reversed. I.e.: when filtering for downloaded episodes

Until I realised that actually it does work as expected, technically at least. From a user perspective, filtering is a bit counter-intuitive (to me, and). _Rather than 'Hide episodes [that fulfill selected criteria]' I expect(ed) 'Only show [episodes that fulfil selected criteria]._

I know I'm stupid not to read the dialog title, but I think it does show current practice may not be so intuitive. Looking at other apps I have installed, positive filtering does seem standard practice.

Now, I understand this is yet another issue where 'users may get confused if we change things', but I wanted to share this 'insight' and I'm curious to what the developers think of positive filtering in this case (especially in the imaginary circumstances the filtering was new and unknown yet to users).

Other news-ish apps (like email, of our public broadcaster) also do auto-update, at least on opening the app, so I'd say it's not that strange of behaviour (in today's fast-moving world).

What does 'if space is needed' imply: episode cleanup will be performed only when episode cache is full (as in number of items in the queue = or > cache setting) [rather than continuously checking if an episode/file should be removed]?

**And one about the relation to auto-delete:**
These settings seem somewhat overlapping, no? Shouldn't they be merged? I find the settings a bit confusing.

**Remark about the location**
Why is this placed under the Network section? I would expect it close (just below) 'Auto Delete', or if not there at least some other place than Network - it doesn't really have anything _directly_ to do with network/(wifi/mobile) data use?.

Anyway, as soon as I turn on the screen, the feed is always updated.

So I tried this:
- press ""update feed""
- wait 5-6 seconds (the average time it usually took for refresh in previous versions) and turn off the screen (press power button)
- wait 1 second and turn on the screen

And the feed is almost always refreshed!

So it seems the refresh process is running at the usual speed, but it's not properly displayed on the screen, it takes some triggering event (screen power off-on) to have the display status updated.

After the call ends, playback resumes over the phone speakers instead of waiting for me to also plug the headphones back in. In my opinion this is not desirable behaviour.
I feel it would be better if headphone disconnect playback pause and phone call playback pause mechanisms were entirely independent, and reconnects/call ends of one didn't restart the playback paused by the other mechanism.

Headphones Disconnect - ON

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Difficult queue reordering,[],"Hi,
this is on a Moto G running Cyanogenmod 12.1 (Android 5.1.1) and Antennapod 1.4.0.12 from F-Droid.

It seems it has become very difficult to reorder episodes in the queue, especially when moving the episode causes the view to scroll.

One example which almost always seems to mess up the queue:
- Grab the first episode by the points on the left
- Move it down until the view begins to scroll
  Here already the first issue comes up: It is very difficult to control by what amount the view scrolls - just a little more makes the list scroll very fast almost immediately.
- When now trying to scroll less fast I almost always get one or more of the following symptoms:
  -- Other episodes being moved as well
  -- Two episodes (other than the moved one) perpetually interchanging positions
  This makes it very difficult to move only one episode more than a few positions without messing up the queue.

I have noticed that there seems to be a related bug #1409 with similar issues which however was closed for the version (1.4.0.12) I am experiencing the issues here.

I have made a small video so you can see what I mean. (Finger position indicated by the dot)

http://www.file-upload.net/download-11090432/antennapod.mp4.html

In the video, the queue first contains episode 69..80 of the ""Mythen"" Podcast (yellow icon), ordered, with other episodes behind. I try to pull the uppermost episode downwards three times and you can see how the whole queue gets messed up.

Thanks for the good work for the app which I use everyday & hope that helps,

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,More smark options,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","Usually podcasts last way longer than songs, 60 and 90 minutes are quite common. And many of them have 'garbage' (ads, uncut overlapping times from other contiguous chapters or programs), that you would like to skip especially at the end of the episode, all while considering current episode as fully played.

I guess that this is why a 'smart mark as played' optional time is offered; you can currently choose between No and 15/30/45/60 seconds.

I would like to request to expand this to allow to select for several minutes. For example, my typical podcast has usually around 5 minutes of overlapping content at the end I have to skip to go to next episode. I would bet that 5 minutes for something 60/90/120 minutes long is way more frequent than 60 seconds, the longest I can choose. Adding 5 and 10 minutes to the current available options would more or less make it for many people with minimal developer effort.

Alternatively, I would rather prefer to let me choose the amount in seconds I want, instead of being only offered a closed set of predefined values. This way developers would not need to guess which options to offer, simply let the user enter what they feel it fits him. That would be slightly more complicated to code, but not much; perhaps only some code to prevent absurdly high or negative values to be accepted would be in order for safety.

That's the actual order I ended up with just now on my phone, trying to drag A to the end.

Also, this may be unrelated, but if I turn off the display, sometimes the queue is scrolled back to the top when I turn the screen back on.  I'm not sure yet exactly what triggers it, but it'd be nice if it stayed where I was previously.  Just now, I tried it 10 times, got bumped back to the top of the queue 7 out of the 10.

I love the product, but this feels less polished than the previous release.  If any other information would help diagnose the issue, I'm happy to help.

I am on a Nexus 4 with android 5.1.1.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,How to import data folder backup?,[],"Hello!

I had to reset my factory smartphone and am now struggling to get AntennaPod back to the previous status, which I had saved by syncing the `/data/de.danieloeh.antennapod/files/`folder. I synced it back, but neither AntennaPod [1.3.4.1](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=antenna&fdid=de.danoeh.antennapod), nor [1.4.0_rc10 and 11](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=antenna&fdid=de.danoeh.antennapod) recognise the files that are already present in its new data folder.

Adding new subscriptions works fine, but what can I do to get the old subscriptions, downloads and playback status back? Thanks for any advice!

PS: And in order to prevent the same problem in the future: Is the `cache` folder required in the backup, or other locations as well? Can the playback queue be backed-up?

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Error (Unknown error) and freezing using Sonic media player,[],"I'm struggling to get variable speed playback working in Antennapod.  I started with 1.3.4.1 and Prestissimo, but I couldn't get playback to work consistently (would crash either at the beginning or end of just about everything I tried to listen to).  I uninstalled Prestissimo, joined the beta program, and downloaded 1.4.0.10, and tried using ""Sonic media player"" instead, and experienced similar symptoms.  I tried Prestissimo with 1.4.0.10, and the same problems happened.

Here are the symptoms:
- Many episodes just won't start playing.  I press ""play"", and the play icon changes to a pause icon, but no playback occurs. The time index does not increase.  I can't get playback again until I force-stop Antennapod and restart it.  I haven't figured out if this is podcast- or episode-specific yet; it seems to happen randomly.
- Transition between one episode and the next (continuous playback) causes playback to stop.  The error dialog ""Error (Unknown error)"" pops up, and again I have to force-stop antennapod.

All problems go away if I disable ""Sonic media player"" in the settings (and don't have Prestissimo installed) before I first attempt to start playback.  It doesn't seem to matter what the speed setting is; the mere fact of having Sonic enabled causes this behavior.

I'm on CM11 on an xt907.  Is there a way for me to provide any additional useful debugging info for this?  Would love to help get varispeed playback working reliably...
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Understanding translation,"[Label(name=""question"")]","So I suspect the following files are related to translation of AP, but could someone confirm, correct and/or expand if needed?
- [AntennaPod/.tx/config](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/.tx/config) → The transifex project configuration. Indicates which translation files (eg trans.fr or trans.sv_SE) need to be placed in which folder in the codebase
- [AntennaPod/core/src/main/res/](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/tree/develop/core/src/main/res) → The folder in the codebase where all translation files are stored. Each language has its own folder, eg values-fr or values-sv-rSE, with in that folder a strings.xml file.
- [AntennaPod/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/util/LangUtils.java](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/util/LangUtils.java) → creates an array in the app with language codes and their written-out names.

And finally, another question:
If I'd change the Transifex configuration file and do a pull request to add another language that's been translated on Transifex (and let's say the PR gets accepted), would that mean that automatically with the next import from Transifex (by the main developers), the right folders in AntennaPod/core/src/main/res/ would be created?
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Introducing a language threshold,[],"Following the discussion in #1369 and earlier thoughts, I would like to propose a translation threshold for including languages in the app. If a language has less than that threshold translated (the 'English' resource, not considering the description or changelog), then we shouldn't provide it in the app.

This would create a cleaner interface in the app itself. But it also relates to the question of claiming which languages you support in Google play, maybe later on the website as well: if you have just 50% translated, than it wouldn't be fair to claim that language is supported.

Though a bit arbitrarily, I would suggest a threshold of 75%.

This would cut off the following languages:
- Hebrew (Israel) 74% [he_IL]
- Russian (Russia) 74% [ru_RU]
- Polish (Poland) 68% [pl_PL]
- Danish 68% [da]
- Portuguese (Brazil) 62% [pt_BR]
- Greek 59% [el]<br />
  NOTE: Greek is currently not imported from Transifex either
- Hindi (India) 52% [hi_IN]
- Italian 49% [it]<br />
  NOTE: Italian (Italy) // 85% // Nov 01, 04:03p.m. // [it_IT] _is_ available, so `it_IT` can be used for `it`
- Romanian (Romania) 44% [ro_RO]
- Azerbaijani 38% [az]
- Spanish (Spain) 35% [es_ES]<br />
  NOTE: Spanish // 100% // Nov 03, 05:03p.m. // [es] _is_ available, so `es`can be used for `es_ES`
- and other languages with less than 35% of the strings translated

I put the languages that _will_ be available on the wiki: [Supported languages](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Supported-languages)

I would be willing to spend some time activating people to update the languages that are just below the threshold.

`Bokmål ([ˈbuːkmɔːl], literally ""book tongue"") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90%[2] of the population in Norway.` ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l))

So let's say a podcast is reported by AP to be 40 mins, the podcast might only be 38 mins long but will have the last 2 mins repeated.

I suspect this may be related to either pausing or skipping forward in episodes as shorter episodes do not do this. I usually skip adverts, and longer episodes i may not listen to in one go. However, I have also had intermittent problems with skipping lately as well, where skipping forward will sometimes take me back to where I started skipping from (eg I skip at the start of an advert, it tkaes me forward to half way so I skip again and I end up at where I started skipping).

For example, my wife has an iPhone has downloaded the last two episodes, and here is a comparison of the episode length from iTunes and AntennaPod:

Friend of Jesus - Part Three (iTunes Run Time: 45:05, AntennaPod Run Time: 2:06:35)
Friend of Jesus - Part Two (iTunes Run Time: 40:17, AntennaPod Run Time: 1:51:03)

When I let an episode play uninterrupted, it will play until the exact time listed in iTunes and then it will end and the episode will be removed from the queue even though it has not reached the end of the listed run time.  If I pause an episode and then resume play, the audio will not begin from the spot where I paused it and will jump back to near the beginning.

It seems as though something is getting corrupted with the run times because the audio quality is fine but I'm not sure why the issues are happening.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Starting Bluetooth playback on reconnect doesn't always work correctly,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The best example is when your device is paired with a car stereo.  AntennaPod will start playback as soon as the device connects to the car.  However, the car stereo may not have the Bluetooth source selected. As a result AntennaPod podcasts will be playing through episodes, but the user will have no idea this is happening. As far as they're concerned they just started their car and are driving somewhere listening to the radio/cd/nothing.

One thought for how to resolve this so that it works properly for people with Bluetooth headsets is to have a setting that determines if AntennaPod will start playback on bluetooth reconnect.  It has also been suggested that AntennaPod should vibrate some when it starts playback due to a Bluetooth reconnect.

This behavior changed in AntennaPod 1.4 alpha, so I think we should try to resolve it before we release 1.4.

I use my phone with two different Bluetooth audio devices. These devices both include one ""forward"" and one ""back"" button. In the past, these buttons mapped to the in-track Rewind and Fast Forward functions, which would step back/forward some number of seconds. I liked that.

It looks like this functionality changed. It seems now that the ""back"" hardware button on my Bluetooth devices does nothing within AntennaPod, while the ""forward"" button now skips to the next podcast file instead of fast forwarding in the current track.

Unfortunately, I am unable to say with confidence if this change came about because of a recent update to AntennaPod, or with the recent upgrade my phone experienced from Android KitKat to Lollipop. Please feel free to swat this down if you're confident that no such changes were made on the AntennaPod side, or if this working as intended.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Android home screen widget requires first opening main app,[],"Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011
Android Version: 5.1
Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87
AntennaPod version: 1.4.0.2

The home screen widget is a 1-high-by-4-wide widget that lists the podcast's title, includes a track progress time indicator in the form of ""current hh:mm:ss / total hh:mm:ss"" and a play/pause button.

If the AntennaPod app has not recently been opened, is not listed in the recent apps list, or was at some point exited by the Android OS to clear up RAM, the widget does not fully work. In this situation, you see the most recent track's title and the play button, but no progress/total time. Upon hitting the play button, I do see it's on/off-touch actions as the background highlights, but it does not start playing. 

At this point, I see two options:

Option 1: First open the app (using its main icon or clicking elsewhere on widget) and then hit the play button. Now it's registered, and so when you go back to the widget, you now see the current/total time and the widget's play button will function.

Option 2: First open the app (using its main icon or clicking elsewhere on widget), but then do **not** actually hit the play button. Go back to the widget. If you do this, the play button will now function, but the area of the widget which _should_ show the current/total time is still blank. Once this happens, I can't figure out how to get the current/total time to show on the app again. Play/pause it as much as you want, either from the widget or within the app, it looks like the current/total time will not return to the app until the app is cleared from memory (by Android or by you manually) and you execute the steps listed above in Option 1.

I know this is really corner case stuff. You have no obligation to address my issues, I'm just happy to provide you information.

I noticed that they current playback time does not update every second, but instead only ever 5 seconds. So if you stare at it while it's playing, instead of seeing 00:02:43... 00:02:44... 00:02.45..., etc, over the course of 20 seconds, you will only see 00:02:43... 00:02:48... 00:02:53... 00:02:58.. 00:03:03.

This may be intentional to reduce battery/resource consumption, or may be a limitation of Android's widget refresh rate, but I figured it was worth mentioning.

# Proposed description

With AntennaPod you get instant access to millions of free and paid podcasts, from independent podcasters to large publishing houses such as the BBC, NPR and CNN. Add, import and export their feeds hassle-free using the iTunes podcast database, OPML files or simple RSS URLs. Save effort, battery power and mobile data usage with powerful automation controls for downloading episodes (specify times, intervals and WiFi networks) and deleting episodes (based your favourites and delay settings).

But most importantly: Download, stream or queue episodes and enjoy them the way you like with adjustable playback speeds, chapter support and a sleep timer. And show your podlove to the content creators with our Flattr integration.

Made by podcast-enthousiast, AntennaPod is free in all senses of the words: open source, no costs, no ads.

All features:
- Easily add and import feeds via the iTunes and gPodder.net directories, OPML files and RSS or Atom links
- Manage playback from anywhere: homescreen widget, system notification and earplug and bluetooth controls
- Enjoy listening your way with adjustable playback speed, chapter support (MP3, VorbisComment and Podlove) and an advanced sleep timer (shake to reset, lower volume and slow down playback)
- Take control over automated downloading: choose feeds, exclude mobile networks, select specific WiFi networks, require the phone to be charging and set times or intervals
- Manage storage by setting the amount of cached episodes, smart deletion (based on your favourites and play status) and selecting your preferred location
- Share episodes and feeds through advanced social media and email options, the gPodder.net services and via OPML export
- Support content creators with Flattr integration including automatic flattring
- Keep track of the best of the best by marking episodes as favourites
- Find back that one episode through the playback history or by searching (titles and shownotes)
- Access password-protected feeds and episodes
- Take advantage of paged feeds (www.podlove.org/paged-feeds)
- Back-up your subscriptions with the gPodder.net integration and OPML export

# Enhencement

A bit more flexibility in these settings could be nice:

**Remove episodes:**
- After: [radio buttons]
  - completing playback [default]
  - pausing(/skipping) or completing playback
- With a delay of: [dropdown]
  - 0 days (immediately)
  - 1 day [default]
  - 3 days 
  - 5 days
  - 7 days
- But exclude: [checkboxes]
  - favourites [default: Y]
  - episodes in the queue [default: Y]

The advantage of adding 'remove after pausing' is that if you loose interest of an episode and tap 'next' halfway through, these episodes can be automatically deleted after a while and won't take up memory space indefinitely.

**What if you just pause and want to listen to an episode later again?**
Because many people just pause an episode with the intention to listen to it again later, this option should not be the default. In practice, this setting I imagine will almost always be applied in combination with a delay of a couple of days; when the episode has not been restarted after those days, there's probably a lack of interest (this would be my use case, with a setting of 5 days).

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Playback Broken,"[Label(name=""needs info"")]","I recently flashed my phone to the factory image and now Playback on Antenna Pod is borked. This may be related to issue #1223.

Longer podcasts take a few seconds (~2-5 sec) to begin playback, then stop playing after ~3 minutes; if you press play after it stops 3 minutes into playback, it plays again for ~3 minutes -- repeat.

Sometimes podcasts will not play at all. this happens especially when I try to play another podcast after pressing play on another one before it has started playing (during that 2-5 second buffer timeframe).

**Symptoms:**
- Playback only works on occasion.
- Playback only continues for ~3 to 3:20 minutes.

**Tested With Episodes**
- Roosterteeth Podcast: 343
- Planet Money: 657, 656

**Specs:**
- Android 4.4.4
- Moto G Generation 1
- AntennaPod Version 1.3.1, Commit 2f55256 (From fDroid)

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Playback position regularly moves back to pre-last position after pause,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Often, but I can't tell in which cases exactly, the playback position of an item regularly moves back to pre-last position after pause. What I mean with that is:
- I play an item and pause it (playback time A). (some stuff happens in between) then play again and pause again (playback time B)
- when resuming the play again, the progress bar and currently playing position show correct data (playback time B) for half a second or so, but then changes to playback time A.

What I don't know:
- if it happens only when I pause it via the lock screen, or when playback gets paused when I unplug my earbuds, or when I manually pause it in the playing bar at the bottom or the system notification
- if it happens with certain 'some stuff happens in between' (i.e. play another item, refresh feeds, shutdown phone, check email, etc)
- if it also happens if I only paused once (playback time A being 0, basically) [I think it does sometimes, but I'm not sure]

This issue has been present for quite a while (throughout some different versions). Don't know why I only reported it now. I have not enabled prestissimo. The issue plays up I think for different feeds.

I found it rather cumbersome to note down every single pause and the consequence in daily use (playback gets paused rather often) and thus I didn't do it. Any feedback on if it's really necessary to do so (to provide more detailed info) or on other means of getting more detailed info is appreciated.

I went looking around and found this issue:

so it's possible that there is some change in Android 5.x that in combination with a server change (HTTP 2 support on part of Wordpress?) triggers this problem.

A couple of days ago there was a change request about changing the background color for something in the application. We were planning to take that but we can not find it anymore so we figured that someone did it already. Are there any other easy change requests that the community has that we can do for our project?

I have my phone synced to my car's Bluetooth, and am able to play audio. When I turn off the car, playback pauses, as expected. But when I then hit ""play"" on the phone, the progress bar does not activate, and the ""play"" button does not change to ""pause"". I need to then open up Android's task manager, kill AntennaPod, then open it again, at which point I see a popup stating that the AntennaPod app had crashed. I click OK, open AntennaPod again, and now playback starts working again.

In fact, the same scenario plays out when I go from playing on my phone's speaker, to starting playback over Bluetooth.

Upon clicking ""play"" to resume listening to a podcast in my queue, I am occasionally seeing a problem in which the podcast in question gets skipped and the next podcast in the queue starts.

I am not able to reproduce this on command. It currently seems to happen only about 10% of the time.

---

Hello Antennapodders,

Good work and many thanks! 

Here is a feature request for a workflow:
- Please enable the enhanced ""cog gears and filter"" multiselect interface, as it exists for the Podcast Episode listing, for the ""Completed Downloads"" group. (This button appears in the top row of icons)

My particular circumstance (Antennapod 1.3.4.1 dark theme- Samsung S4 mini running AICP custom ROM):

I've downloaded LOTS of episedes while I have a good wifi connection. They all enqueue, which is good, but for so many it's hard to sort them properly. So I actually cleared the queue of 145 episodes and now its quite difficult to rebuild it.

When I go to the Downloads section via the side bar, I find myself on the blank Running slide-tab. Since any particular user is only actually running the downloads for a short period, it might be better to have ""Completed"" as the initial display.

On the completed slide-tab, I've got the rubbish bin icons on the right to delete individual episodes, but I can't multiselect, filter, group or sort the downloaded episodes. 

If this Completed Downloads interface had the enhanced filtering and multi-select,  we'd be able to 1) rebuild the queue much more efficiently, 2) bulk delete accidentally downloaded, 3) use sort and filter to review the entire collection.
## 

This appears to have a similar background to #1209"" Add filter and sort options to the ""All episodes"" view #1209 ""

Apologies if this has been requested or phrased in a different thread. I just signed onto Github with Antennapod as the catalyst (hooray!)....and while I think I saw something similar in the issues archive, for the life of me I cannot find the thread!

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,APod freezes on fast forwarding to end of episode,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","## Issue Description

I have a 2014 Moto X running official 5.1. I have an issue where if I am listening to an episode, and fast forward it with the slider all the way to the end, it will freeze, and if i get it to move it will give me an error message. 
## Additional Info
- I listen to episodes at 2x speed and am using the prestissimo library for that.
- I set the option to auto delete when 100% listened.
- There is another episode in the queue after the one I am fast forwarding through

Thank you very much for all your work.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,FR: replace share menu by dialog,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As first proposed by @mfietz in #905 (Share website url comes out as share url), I would like to execute the share menu by a dialog. Also, this would be an opportunity to unify sharing across the 'currently playing' screen (which uses a second menu) and the 'feed overview' screen (where there are two options in the top-right menu).

I think this will make sharing easier, especially from the currently playing screen as it takes some proper attention to discern the different menu options. Also, this should lead to fewer steps needed to share*.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Update playback notification,[],"Updated the notification bar to show the skip episode action (was necessary to improve lock screen controls on 5.0+).

The number of options displayed depends on if you have continuous playback and/or persistent notifications enabled.

Swapped the feed title with the episode title since 1) it made more sense this way and 2) there's more room for the episode title given the smaller font.

Got rid of the time that was displayed.

Also updated how skipping episodes works. Now, by default, when you skip and episode it isn't removed from the queue.  If you still want that behavior there's a setting that will do it for you.

Unfortunately I'm not sure we can get the expanded notification on the lock screen.

It could work by simply distributing the `Playback Speeds` steps along the `Sleep Timer`'s time axis with the 1st ""downstep"" happening immediately.

Example: Speeds 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 are set upBefore starting the timer, playback is at 1.5x. Setting the sleep timer to 20min, the first 10min play at 1.25 (immediate downstep) and the last 10 at 1.0.

The next button doesn't actually mean there is another episode in the queue, it might end the playback altogether.

APod is now able to set the lockscreen background. It is a preference: There are probably a lot of people that prefer their own background image to the episode image on the lockscreen.
Maybe ""lockscreen background"" is a bit misleading: Basically, any other app/service that is ""listening"" (that receives MediaSession information) can read that image and show it. If enabled, watch apps will also be able to show the cover. ""Cover art""? Not sure it this is any better, might only be more confusing.
Because of Glide, the meta data is updated in a background thread. Not sure if executing on the executor service is the best idea or if this should just run in its own thread... I guess we'll see if this leads to unwanted behavior

When a ServiceBackedMediaPlayer was created on startup but the current episode is paused (we played an episode and restarted the app; external player is at the bottom, but paused), the media player already acquired a wakelock without needing it. This would only get justified when the user actually started playing.
So, now the wakelock is only acquired if it was held when the method was called.

My reply to the comments by @Cathryne:

> Do I understand correctly, that these suggestions would make the ""distance-to-option"" dependent on the number of subscribed podcasts?

Yes

> If yes, why punish listeners with many subscriptions in this way?

Well, I guess that's one way to look at it ^^ Instead of focussing on a negative attitude of developers/the programme ('punishing the listeners'), I would like to look at the likelyhood of an option being used. I don't know about you, but personally, and I would think many users with me, tap on a feed in the drawer far more often than they tap on 'Add podcast'. If this is indeed is the case for most users, then to me it only makes sense to put the 'add podcast' entry below the feed list in the drawer. The less often a function gets used, the higher its' ""distance-to-option"" can be (and vice versa). Plus, the larger the list of 

> It's IMHO fine to have a few items pinned (configurable & rather at the top, than at the bottom, but hey!).

Sure, it's absolutely fine to have a few items pinned. But, again, following the reasoning above, the ""distance-to-option"" relative to how often a function is used, would make it only logical to not have the settings pinned. Indeed this is in line with (current) [Material Design guide](http://www.google.be/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html#navigation-drawer-content).
And pinning items at the top I feel really goes against all UI/UX conventions :P

> In order to clean up space the vertical space of each item & podcast title should be reduced. The necessity to shrink the covers in the drawer to about half their current size would IMHO be balanced out by aa separate subscription view with large cover images (not sure I'd use it, because I really like the drawer list).

Although I see that the vertical height of the menu items, the feeds could be reduced, I absolutely wouldn't shrink the feed images any further; on [my phone](https://fairphone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201064718-What-are-the-technical-specifications-of-the-Fairphone-1-)'s 4.3 inch screen, I'm already _just able_ to see the images properly (as in: being able to see what's on an image, with [No Agenda](http://feed.nashownotes.com/rss.xml) being the worst).
As you say, people would still use the nav drawer to navigate between feeds quickly, and most of us would only use the subscriptions view only for a more 'immersive' view (plus reaching archived feeds that may be added in future as per #1182). As the subscription view is 'extra' (at least it seems to be for the both of us), for me shrinking images doesn't balance out as you say.

I haven't spotted specific patterns that trigger it but I think it only happens when I'm using my bluetooth headphones, and when I use the play button on them to resume playback. What I expect to happen is that the podcast episode I'm half-way through starts, what actually happens is the episode gets marked as played and deleted (I don't have it configured to keep files otherwise I run out of space). Sometimes it'll also delete the next couple of episodes I have queued as well.

This is infuriating if I'm out as I can't re-download the ~150mb file even over 3g as it's just not reliable enough so I don't get to listen to what I had queued until I'm home again. It's also minorly annoying because I have to find my place in the episode again when I've re-downloaded it.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,NullPointerException when using 'targetView',"[Label(name=""bug"")]","This has been reported on Google Play in a  couple of spots now.  I'm not entirely sure why we're seeing this now but weren't before.  The simple solution is to check everything for null first, but it would be better to know why it's null in the first place.

First example:

```

Opening it always shows none of the intervals marked and no matter which I choose (and it does close after I select one so it's tough to tell if it selected it) I don't get any automatic updates to available podcasts. I have Mobile Updates and Automatic Download turned off, but I'm on WiFi a lot.

I didn't see this listed already, but maybe I missed it or it's already being fixed or it's specific to the F-Droid build.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Can now download things while on mobile.,[],"The glide url loader now uses its own OkHttpClient.
The result is that we can now search for podcasts and download them while on mobile

they haven't asked us to do while on mobile).

I'm not sure if this is the _right_ solution, we don't load _any_ images while on the mobile network this way.  It is better than the current situation where we can't really download anything while on mobile data unless the user has mobile download enabled.

Something worth noting is that we have multiple copies of the downloadCompletionThread running (DownloadService.java:181) when I would expect there to be on one (queue Highlander reference).

I haven't really been able to put my finger on what's wrong just yet.

Any ideas @mfietz?

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Battery: Persistent CPU wakelocks when inactive,[],"Hello,
Today I did not use my Phone and the battery went from 80% to 10% in a few hours.
A look in Wakelock Detector told me that my Phone was active all the time. AntennaPod (more exactly: com.aocate.media.ServiceBackedMediaPlayer) prevented the CPU from sleeping for 93% of the up time (since 1d and a few hours)!
During this period I was in flight mode, did not listen to any episode and nothing was paused, either. So AntennaPod should have been (almost) completely inactive.

After I forced AntennaPod to exit the battery stayed at 10% for 3 hours :)

I use CyanogenMod 12.1 and AntennaPod 1.3.1.

A) determine the displayed number in the drawer
B) determine the numbers for the counter (the ""set subscription order"" setting 'sort by counter') and thus the order of the feeds if 'sort by counter' is selected

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure why this actually works, but I tested this both on a (virtual) 4.1.1 and a 4.4.4 device.
_OkHttp_ should take care of setting the socket's enabled protocols (see ConnectionSpec). I'm not familiar with OkHttp and not motivated enough to find out what exactly doesn't work here... A fix is a fix ^^

Also upgraded OkHttp to the latest version and increased the sleep time of the feed media service to 5s to be even more server friendly.

Side note: This was caused on 4.x devices by servers only allowing TLS 1.1 and 1.2, but not 1.0
I don't think this is very common. I'd rather have an insecure podcast download than nothing to play...

The obvious solution is to turn the volume up, but **some podcasts are so much louder than others that going from one to the other becomes jarring. Some setting or automatic feature that normalises all the audio would be great**.""

Same for me; sometimes I'll just pull out my headphones on the bike when I can't hear what they're talking about on a new episode from the queue (no, I don't have buttons on my earplugs to skip episode or adjust volume :) )

I would like to add the option to set audio levels to the softer, middle or louder podcasts (I know this boils down to an additional volume setting front-end, but back-end it would be determining the volume edit between finishing normalisation and saving the file). Reason: normalisation may not be enough to pump up the volume high enough to suit biking (although maybe I'm wrong here).

I propose a new feature -- say when pressing or long pressing on a line -- that would show a full URL (so I can copy/paste it in the browser and try it out myself) and show the full error to understand what's going on and if the podcast is even worth following.

![timer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6860662/9154520/936d074e-3e93-11e5-965d-3232652fee59.png)

The dialog will now remember the last settings.

I know, the layouts look redundant, but I found no other way to make the dialog look this way, e.g. if you remove the outer LinearLayout, the dialog will become very narrow.
# When timer is about to expire...

10s before the timer is about to expire, users can choose to get a short 0.5s vibration, we need a new permission here. Not sure if this may have any implications on devices with no vibrator, maybe the Play Store will tell them APod is not compatible...
In any case, the audio's volume will be lower significantly. Lowering it to 10% may look much: I tried to find a balance between still being able to hear and detecting the actual volume change [1]. 10% turned out to be the best solution for me.
Shake to reset will only work in this 10 second timeframe. I took the threshold from someone else's code - maybe we have to lower it in another commit, not sure how good people are at giving their phones/tablets a good shake (acceleration!) while lying down...
If a shake is detected, the timer will be reset to 15 mins [2], the volume will be reset to 100% as a kind of audible shake detection confirmation.

Resolves #247
Improvement over #466
I'm also considering closing #228. Fading out sounds nice, but is (as already said) not noticeable enough.
## 

[1] Not really sure what is up with the volume setting. I don't think it is linear... when I lowered the volume to 50% or so, the volume change would not be noticeable immediately
[2] Well, I could almost bet on a FR to make this configurable. Not sure if it is worth the effort... Getting an other EditText in the dialog without messing up the layout could be harder that it looks

What's interesting is that it came from within a 'Log.d()' line that should have been removed by ProGuard. I suspect it just removed the call to Log.d(), but that the computation that occurs in the call still occurs.

Is it ok to pass the .load() function of Glide a null pointer?  If so, awesome. If not we'll need to fix a couple of other places.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Only autodownload queued and new items,[],"After some thought and use of autodownload as it stands now, auto-downloading all unplayed episodes is just not the expected behavior for anyone.  If we autodownload all unplayed episodes then if you subscribe to a new feed all of the episodes from that feed are candidates to be autodownloaded, and they may trump other 'new' episodes from other feeds.

So, this change makes it so that only queued and new items are autodownloaded. If you want to download something else you can still click the 'Download' button and it will still be downloaded and enqueued.

As a result, I think AntennaPod/AntennaPod#1060 will probably wind up focusing on the cleanup algorithm, favorites, etc...

This also fixes a small bug that occurs when upgrading the database to set the autodownload flag to false.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Queue centric AutoDownload and Cleanup Algorithms,"[Label(name=""question"")]","There's been some confusion recently about when things get auto downloaded and when they get cleaned up.

Part of this is from actual bugs and part of it is because the functionality is just plain confusing.  The problem is that changing the behavior may break some users' workflows.  Some might say that those users' workflows should be broken, but it's probably wiser to find a solution that can make everyone happy.

To do that I'd like to propose a new workflow that will likely become the default, but give users the choice to retain the old one.
## AutoDownload and Queuing

AutoDownload will download and add to the queue all items which are 'New' and have auto-download enabled (e.g. it will still support disabling downloads for individual feeds).  

It currently downloads any unread items.

An item is new if it hasn't been acted on in some way.  All new items show up in 'New Episodes' currently.  This essentially makes New Episodes the list of items that will be downloaded the next time auto download is activated.

While we think we have #1009 under control with the auto-download flag, this change would certainly have helped with it too.
## Cleanup

Cleanup will consider any item that isn't currently in the queue as eligible for deletion.  Currently an item has to be fully played and not in the queue for it to be deleted.  Items won't get deleted immediately, but the next time AntennaPod needs space it will remove items that aren't queued.  This will resolve the problem of having new items but them not being downloaded because you simply removed an item you didn't care about from the queue.  Currently to make room for an item you have to mark the item as read and remove it from the queue, or go to 'Downloads' and remove it there.  Which is more complicated than needs to be.

This change to cleanup should resolve #939, #699.
## Enhancements

Some users like to keep episodes after they've already listened to them. We could add (either now or as a future enhancement) a 'Favorites' capability (something that's been requested a number of other times). Items that are 'favorited' won't be deleted by the cleanup algorithm.  (#538, wouldn't quite be as full featured as #851, but that would be more complicated to handle from a 'don't delete this' standpoint and take more time to implement)

We might want to update what makes an item appear new. With this system an item added to the queue will never be new. A user might want to be able to see what new things have been downloaded and added the queue.  Not sure what would be a good way to indicate that.

Finally, we might want to add some ability to remove stale items from the queue. User can ask to bulk remove everything older than 7 days or something to that effect.
## Transition

I think the user should be allowed to choose between this and the 'classic' algorithm, but I would like this to be the default in the future since I think it makes far more sense.  So there's a question of how to transition without having people that would prefer classic lose all their episodes.  I'd propose the following (though I'm not sure it's the best idea).

For new installs, we just default to this new algorithm.  But, if the user is upgrading, on the first launch of the app we ask the user if they want to switch to the queue centric model that allows for easier management of automatic downloads and easier cleanup of old episodes.  If they prefer they can stick with classic which downloads more things and requires more interaction to clean up old episodes.
## Implementation

We'd create a new EpisodeCleanupAlgorithm and a new AutomaticDownloadAlgorithm. Choosing the new mode would use those algorithms instead of APCleanupAlgorithm and APDownloadAlgorithm.
## Thoughts

Any thoughts or opinions?  Any other related issues I missed?

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Queue duration summary includes non-downloaded episodes in count,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","It's possible to have non-downloaded items in the queue. The summary at the top of the queue includes the duration of podcasts that haven't been downloaded yet.

Is this a good idea?  Should we only include downloaded podcasts?  Should we have an indicator that they're not all downloaded?

I needed a mechanism to delete the already downloaded feed or episode images on upgrade. In the future, we can use this class whenever APod has to do upgrade maintenance.

In my tests, deleting a huge image cache could take quite a while (20-50s). So deleting is done in its own thread. In my tests, this had no impact on the running app.
# Preference: Image Cache

There is now a user preference where one can set the limit for cached images. Default: 100 MiB (Else, Glide's default would be 250 MiB)
(FYI, 1 MiB or Mebibyte = 1.048.576 bytes, 1 MB or megabyte = 1.000.000 bytes...)

We exclude episodes that are currently in the queue.

Possible new issues: There might be users that performed an action that automatically disabled auto downloading (like downloading or playing) and manually re-activated auto downloading. These users will lose their manual change.

   From the Fragment documentation:
   Every fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated
   when restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that
   subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these
   constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated;
   instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with setArguments(Bundle)
   and later retrieved by the Fragment with getArguments().

This could probably be integrated in the interface by adding a button on the right of the playback controls in the player view, which would trigger a pop-up menu with available speeds, Youtube-style, or a separate pop-up with a slider.

However, a brief search reveals that the Android API by default does not include a functionality to change playback speed. See [this Android issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1961) and also [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5149050/changing-the-speed-of-music-playback-in-android). So this FR will probably have to sit here for quite a while, unless someone decides to re-implement variable playback rate, or Google suddenly releases an update.

I might have been mistaken though, as I am poorly familiar with the details of Android development, so someone should look into whether this is actually impossible with the current API.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Drawer: Feed context menu, counter and order",[],"# New ""new"" state

Problem: Before, we flagged an episode as _new_ when several conditions where satisfied (not downloaded, not in the queue, not marked as played...). When a user wants an episode to not be flagged (e.g. to reset the feed counter showing the number of new episodes) she had to mark the feed as played.
Another problem showed when subscribing to a new podcast. We decided we only want to most recent episode to appear as new. To achieve that, we ourselves had to mark all other episodes as played. Users cannot distinguish if they actually played the episode or not.

Solution: New is now its own (database) state. Basically, ""new"" means unplayed ""and some more"". We no longer have to mark episodes as played on subscribing, they simply become unplayed. On the downside, we now have no mark new episodes as unplayed when they are added to the queue, downloaded, played and so on (on the other side, retrieving new episodes from the DB is a lot easier).

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Option to sort feeds alphabetically ,[],"As discussed in #441 

The feeds were changed from alphabetical to number of unplayed episodes. Is it possible to make it an option?

The two ways I use antennapod are affected by this:
1. Listening to podcasts on demand: me or a friend have a specific feed that we want to listen to, so we want to pull up the feed, see if there are any new episodes or old episodes that we haven't listened to.
2. Queuing up a small percentage of subscribed podcasts.  

I know some other people personally who are the same way.  Detail from my previous post:

I have a limited amount of time available to listen to podcasts compared to the amount of subjects and podcasts I'm interested in. Most of my feeds have a large amount of unplayed new episodes, but that tag is still useful to me:
1. Subscribe to a large list of podcasts of various subjects (from educational to comedy to career-specific)
2. Select a small amount of feeds to auto-download 
3. Add specific episodes to the queue (or for direct streaming) via description
4. Let queue auto-download when on wifi

Step 3 is of course what is affected by this:
- ""New Episodes"" tab
  - mixes all the topics together
  - low-frequency feeds can get lost amongst higher-frequency feeds.
- Static alphabetical view of podcast feeds
  - allows quick access by subject or feed
  - tagging may work as well as I saw in another thread, but one feed may be lighthearted or heavy on the same subject, where selecting individual feeds is still useful to me
  - Unplayed tag still useful (in case marking all as read sorts it alphabetically)
    - old unplayed podcasts are useful if I've exhausted my queue for that subject

I'm open to suggestions in a better process for the same use case with the update.

As the setting depends on your use case (which doesn't usually change), it should not be on the main UI, but rather somewhere in the settings, where I personally don't think it would be considered clutter.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Nav bar unplayed count UX confusion,[],"Hello,

I previously opened #796 requesting the addition of an uplayed count in the Nav bar which was added.

However there were some strange UX choices added which I'd like to see if they can be changed.

Prior to this feature being added, the podcast list in the navbar was sorted alphabetically, these was optimal as you always knew where a particular podcast was in the list.

Once the unplayed count was added to the navbar it appears to have changed the sort order of the podcasts.  This looks to be sorted now as 1) most unlistened, then 2) alphabetically.   This gives a terrible user experience as you have to pay a lot more attention to the list as there is guarantee a podcast will be listed where you expect it.

We get to this line only when the condition on [line 59](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/2d4705461c00dcb131b848789fa2a8a6021d19da/app/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/adapter/DefaultActionButtonCallback.java#L59) is false, which means the episode has no media, but the GpodnetEpisodeAction.Builder is going to try to get the download URL for the 'media', which the item doesn't have (or we wouldn't have gotten here).

I think that we actually don't want to use Gpodder in this case. The user is never actually given a choice in this view to mark an episode with media as played. So this really shouldn't be present.  This mark as 'read' is really only for website only entries.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Streaming to dlna/upnp devices (proof of concept available),"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","I would welcome a feature to stream podcasts to dlna/upnp media renderers (cf. #280). I have implemented a proof of concept for such afeature using the cling library. (Personally, I don't consume any video podcasts and I didn't not care about them in my current implementation.) It took me a while from the first attempt, so my implementation is based on a somewhat outdated version of AntennaPod. I encourage you to have a look at it: https://github.com/volhol/AntennaPod/tree/streammedia

On the MediaplayerActivity you can find a new Item in the menu called select media renderer. 

![menu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11587858/8340733/92a87240-1ac0-11e5-9dad-64fe018aba4a.PNG)

The app tries to find all suitable medai renderers in your local network. Just select one. The app then attemps to play the current media item form the current position on the chosen media renderer.

![select media renderer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11587858/8340740/9c055b14-1ac0-11e5-96f0-ee32210acc74.PNG)

In fact, the app does currently not stream the content to the device itself. Instead it transmits the original URL to the device and asks it to stream the content from there. It may take a while before you can start playback. During this time, you see that the play/pause button changes appearance. Sometimes you may have to press the play button two to three time before the playback starts. Once the media item is played back on the media renderer, you can change the current position as well as the volume like you would in local mode. (Altering the volume works from the MediaplayerActivity only.)  The fast torward/reqind button disapppear since there is no suitable feature for this in dlna/upnp.

I have tested this feature on the four dlna/upnp media renderers I have access to. I found out that each of them behaves a bit differently. Thus, it may not work properly on your devices.

I am of course open to any discussion on if and how this feature could be integrated with an AntennaPod release (standard feature, separate module as prestissimo, ...). I tried to isolate most changes in separate files. Please be aware that the cling library (http://4thline.org/projects/cling/) requires at least API 15.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,New feature: Add Feed-specific 'Delete After Playback' override option,[],"Let me repeat this again:
DO NOT PULL THIS AS-IS. THIS IS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY.

One of the features I still miss in AntennaPod is the ability to control the Auto Delete option _per feed_.
Some feeds are throwaway - once I hear them, I want them to be automatically delete.
Other feeds are precious and I want to keep the chapters I've downloaded.

This pull request adds a new 'Delete After Playback' spinner to the FeedInfoActivity. It has 3 states:
Default - use the global setting
Yes - delete after playback, regardless of the global settings
No - Do not delete after playback, regardless of the global settings

This is my first Android work, and I have a VERY shallow understanding of Java (I come from C/C++), so this pull request is based on googling stackoverflow and the SDK documentation.

I know for a fact that this code does NOT work yet. I ran it through the emulator and I see that my settings is not saved between invocations. I'm sending this to solicit feedback and to learn `android programming.

I also hope I didn't do anything stupid with git. There were a few commits on the main repository between the time I forked and the time I merged my changes back to create the pull request.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,APod does not add the podast if the connection fails.,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi

Maybe it makes sense to not to add a podcast, but the thing is there could be temporary connection issues with the podcast providers. 

Here is a scenario. I have 60 podcasts in an opml file. I import it and some of them fail during import and APod does not add them. They are not listed. Well what if the connection issue is temporary from the server? Sometimes the providers might get hit with lots of request which disables their response?

I think that it will make more sense if APod adds the all the podcasts during import but show some icon or gray it out next to the listing (not in downloads window) to show that it failed during the import. And maybe it will come back during another refresh.

It is a bit confusing this way because hard to keep track of which ones made it back whioch ones are not.

Basically the user will define a backup folder from the settings. And then the user can backup an episode from the episode window function menu by clicking on backup. When the user clicks on backup, APod moves the episode from the data folder to backup folder with the same folder setup like thenameoftheshow-thenameoftheepisode.mp3

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Feed is slow to update,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Updated from 1.1.1 to 1.2.1 and feeds take ages  (minutes or not at all) to update. Logcat is spammed with 'timezone name loaded for en_US in 347Ms ' or similar. I'm using CM7.2 without Gapps and not that locale.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Mark all as unplayed, download all unplayed, enqueue all unplayed",[],"In the feed view, you can now:
- Mark all as unplayed
- Download all unplayed
- Enqueue all unplayed

All of these will show a confirmation dialog just as ""mark all as played"" does.

This PR started with adding the ability to enqueue and download all unplayed episodes. Just downloading/enqueuing all episodes regardless of their play state seemed unreasonable to me.

When a new podcast/feed is added, all but one episodes are marked as played. To download/enqueue all episodes of a newly subscribed podcast, it became necessary to be able to undo this default behavior and mark all episodes as unplayed.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Question regarding continous playback,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Hi

If I wanted to implement continuous playback by default - NOT VIA THE QUEUE. User selects the latest podcast and plays it, when done it moves to the next item what would be the easiest way to do this?

We are creating an App with one podcast preloaded and preventing adding further. Adding to the queue does not make sense due to the nature of the audio, where some are 30 seconds and goes to the next item.

Forcing the user to put audio into a queue would have to be repeated each time they used the app.

So, on playing the latest it should move to the next item downwards.

Any ideas?

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Only call getPSMPInfo if you need both the status and the playable.,[],"Fixes AntennaPod/AntennaPod#942

PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.getPSMPInfo() groups PlayerStatus and the currently playing media (Playable) in a synchronized method so that you can get a consistent picture at any one point in time as to what was happening.  Unfortunately, it was getting called in other synchronized methods (of another class) and PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer has other synchronized methods that also get called.  This occasionally results in deadlock.

To fix it, I created a non-synchronized getPlayable() and now call either getPlayerStatus or getPlayable depending on which is needed except for the rare circumstances when they are both needed. When they're both needed we still call getPSMPInfo().  Luckily, the case where we need both aren't the cases that were causing this deadlock, so I think this should solve the problem.

I would appreciate some review of these changes to make sure I didn't miss anything bad.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Deadlock in PlaybackService.saveCurrentPosition,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","A user reported a deadlock via Google Play. 

After looking at the dump I think what's happening is this:
saveCurrentPosition is synchronized and calls PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.getPSMPInfo() which is itself synchronized.  PlaybackServiceMediaPlayer.setPlayerStatus (which is synchronized) calls saveCurrentPosition. Since these things can happen from different threads we wind up with deadlock.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Episode necromancy,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","AP keeps resurrecting (downloading and adding to the queue) episodes I have listened to.

The resurrected episodes get added as new ones come out in the same feed. At one point the queue was completely empty, the next day I had the new episodes released that day, plus the previous one for each of those feeds. I have auto refresh on every 4th hour, along with autodowload/queue. 

When long-pressing on the episodes I have the option to mark them as unplayed, so I'm assuming AP remembers I've listened to them, or marked them as played/skipped (difference?) before. Marking then as unplayed gives me the option to play them. All the files exist on the device and I can play them immediately and I don't have the option to stream them.

When I notice this, I have to go into each episode, tap to remove the file, wait for the file to be removed, tap to remove it from the queue, back out, wait a while until the episode disappears from the queue (takes several seconds, if it even works), and hope they don't come back again.
Sorting the queue while doing this can get really interesting as it randomly ressurrects episodes I just removed too.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Remove button to Flattr AntennaPod,"[Label(name=""feature request""), Label(name=""question"")]","Now that AntennaPod isn't being maintained by @danieloeh any longer and a team of people are working on it, Daniel, mentioned that he felt we should change who the Flattr money goes to.

After discussing with Daniel and @mfietz we decided that we should remove the ability to flattr the app.  The reason being that since the team is split up, there's no one person who the money should go to.  At the moment we have no expenses (apart from time).  So there really isn't a great way to deal with the revenue Flattr was providing.

We are, of course, very pleased that people like the app enough to donate.  We just don't know how to deal with those funds justly, and as a result felt it would be better to remove the ability to Flattr AntennaPod directly.

This should resolve #507 and #567 as we just won't support accepting money any longer.  If people have a better idea of what to do, please share it here.

From that issue:
_It is the podcast for ""[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RichardHerringLSTPodcast)"".  Every time I add the feed it thinks every podcast is today.  The next day when I updated the feed it increments the day and shows every podcast as today._

Either this message should be removed entirely, or appear consistently at the end of every podcast, right now it seems like a built-in feature accidentally left on.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Fixes Queue not opening, small podcasts images not scaling up and long URL not wrapping",[],"# Queue not opening

I start with the tricky bit: When the main activity is restarted or resumed, we open the last fragment the user opened. Until now, this was read and deleted (set null). When coming back from another activity (audio player), the last fragment would else (when not nulled) be read (this would be the same as the current one) and the current fragment would be loaded again (my emulator shows some sort of short flashing).

Setting the last fragment to null had the following consequence: Coming back from the audio activity, the last fragment would be read and set to null. Opening the other activity and going back would query the last fragment again, this time the preference would be null and the default value Queue would be returned. The app now believes the current fragment to be the queue and not open the queue when trying to do so via drawer. So far, so confusing...

To fix this, the main activity now stores the current fragment in a new string variable, the last fragment is no longer forgotten (nulled). When the last fragment is read, we now check if the last fragment is the current fragment (this can only be the case if the activity is resumed). If they are the same, there is nothing to be done.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Parts of some episodes not deleted,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","While exploring the antennapod/files/media folder using ES File Explorer, I noticed some episodes that appeared to be still there which I had listened to and according to AP weren't there anymore.
I checked the release dates of those episodes and the 'last modified' date in the properties of these files, and the last modified date is probably the date of when I listened to it.
The file size displayed in the properties was also really small, and when trying to play the files it only plays for a little while before stopping.

What I think is going on is that when AP deletes a finished episode, it sometimes is interrupted somehow and part of the file remains. AP randomly crashes sometimes, so maybe that's when it gets interrupted? I have no idea how to replicate this but maybe keeping a list of files to be deleted and checking afterwards if they indeed are would work.

Edit: The files and dates, though I'm pretty sure it's nothing specific about these files or dates.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Some remarks on the version released on 16.06.2015 (performance issues),[],"Hi, I'm no contributer to AntennaPod, but simply a single user observing some issues with the newest version of AntennaPod. The update was done automatically within my Wiko Rainbow (Android 4.4.2) at 16.06.

First of all thank you for this marvellous piece of software. I'm that glad to have it as no other podcast-player on Android is that simple, minimalistic, stable and focused.

With the newest update from 16.06.2015 I observe a significant delay in displaying the episodes-lists, the played list, the podcasts themselves, etc.
The feature showing the unlistened episodes on the right side of the podcasts is great, however it looks like all the changes have changed the speed of the application overall.

Showing the playing list with 321 entries needs more than 20 seconds. Potentially a problem with the length of the list as after deletion of the playing list things are fine again.

However adding a podcast-episode to the playing list by using the context menu lasts ~10-15 seconds.

Opening a podcast-overview lasts 2-3 seconds. That's definitely longer than before. Not dramatic, but new.

But the most significant problem I observed first today having no internet connection at all. I have downloaded all the episodes and placed them in the playing list. Opening the playing list lasted approx. 40-50 seconds. Jumping back and opening one of the podcasts directly was not possible, no episodes were displayed. From my perspective AntennaPod seems to unusable if there's no internet connection even the episodes are downloaded. I could not observe this behaviour with the previously installed version.

Perhaps you can use these details for further improvement. With a heavy heart I will have to search for another podcast-player.

Ciao, Georg

Some thoughts on improvements:
- Material design overhaul
- ~~Use of RecyclerView in place of DSLV~~
- New subscription view (#848, #836)
- ~~Better sharing of episodes (#861)~~
- Display of itunes 'explicit' tags (#724)
- Filtering by itunes 'explicit' tags (#725)
- ~~Support for multiple queues~~
  - I don't think this will happen in 1.3
- ~~Improve visibility of adding podcasts via iTunes~~ - Done
  - This is really the easiest way of adding podcasts
  - Perhaps making it the first option users see and only labeling it 'search'?
- ~~Download all episodes from a feed (#871, #520)~~
- ~~Episode forward/back (#732)~~

I bet there are some other good thoughts on what could be done. 

We should think hard about any changes to how we interact with the app, how these features would change them and how they could all work together.

I have only recently begun to experiment with AntennaPod, but I like it so far. This is more of a question than a bug report maybe. I'm wondering about the skip button and the auto delete behavior.
I am on the Google play version 1.1.2 and I download episodes manually so far.
I understand that there's a cache where episodes go after I listened to them and the oldest gets deleted from there once it's full. Or do all episodes go there once I download them and they delete no matter whether I ever listened to them? Is there a way to list all episodes that I have currently downloaded? Does the cache only work with auto-downloading?

The auto-delete after playback option is in addition to the cache, isn't it?

https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/111 talks about a skip button in relation to auto-deleting. This is exactly the behavior that I am looking for. However, the skip button is just not there on my phone. Or I cannot spot it :)
The notification area only shows play / pause. What's the easiest way to get to the next episode? 

Kind regards,

I can only guess what exactly goes wrong here.
My guess is that okhttp either has a bug in its un-gzip and throws an error although the data was read correctly - or the server does not comply with some standard (e.g. there is no content-length field).

Catching the exception and just continuing as if nothing happened seems to work.

Not sure if additional checks would do any good. We could check the content length if it is sent by the server, but a lot of servers seem to get that wrong (sending the content length of the unzipped data)

My default speeds are 1x and 1.2x. I usually listen to speech podcasts at 1.2x, and Music at 1x.

After a crash (sometimes the App stops, and sometime it just refuses to play), I need to do the following to get it back to work:
1. go to the Application list (""square"" icon/button on Lollipop), and remove the app from the list.
2. Turn off the phone for a few seconds to ensure it's removed from memory.
3. turn on the phone and run the app again.
4. Try playing again. It will play for a brief time (< 1s) and then stop playing. however, it is still responsive and will let me press the prestissimo speed indication and set it back to 1.0
5. Repeat step (1) - (3) 
6. try playing again, this time it will play, but at 1x speed.
7. Wait a few seconds, then press the 1.0 to turn it into 1.2

When I select an audio file, I don't get AntennaPod as a suggested application to open it (only the default Music app, and VLC which I have installed myself).

I don't think this would be due to a recent change in AP (the manifest file still lists the intent-filter `<data android:scheme=""file""/>` and `<data android:mimeType=""audio/*""/>`, but maybe something changed in Android 5.X that requires an update in the manifest file?

Otherwise you can download and run it manually here [debug](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nhaulidpn1chwvl/AntennaPod_1.2_build53_debug.apk?dl=0) or [release](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5vhyazau7f16xb/AntennaPod_1.2_build53_release.apk?dl=0).

Please let us know what you think or if you experience any problems.

Thanks!

Thanks for this app. It does the job for me except that I am confused about what I have listened and finished. It seems to me that there is no way to differentiate finished, marked as read etc from regular casts. For example I mark one mp3 as read but in the list it does not look any different.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Convert AsyncTasks to IntentService ,[],"Hi `AntennaPod` developers, I'm a Ph.D. student and doing research on Android async programming, particularly on AsyncTask and IntentService. AsyncTask can lead to memory leak and losing task result when GUI is recreated during task running (such as orientation change). [This article](http://bon-app-etit.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-dark-side-of-asynctask.html) describes the problems very well. 

We discussed with some Android experts and they agree with this issue, and claim that AsyncTask can be considered only for short tasks (less than 1 second). However, using IntentService (or AsyncTaskLoader) can avoid such problems since their lifecycles are independent from `Activity`/`Fragment`.

In `AntennaPod`, many of the AsyncTasks are declared as non-static inner classes of `Activity`/`Fragment`. So the above issue can occur (especially for relatively long tasks).

I refactored 8 AsyncTasks in `AntennaPod` to IntentService (in separate commits), with the help of a refactoring tool we developed. I also mark some types as `Serializable` in order to put them into Intent. Do you think using IntentService should be better in some of these 8 scenario? Do you want to merge (some) commits in this pr? Thanks.

You could alter the icon in the following way: Make the right arrow a bit shorter and add a dot between the arrows to indicate that the arrows don't go round and round but stopped at some point.

This basically means that the events provided to onScroll are null. From onScroll:

```
public boolean onScroll(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float distanceX, float distanceY) {

        final int x1 = (int) e1.getX();   // this is line 381
        final int y1 = (int) e1.getY();
        final int x2 = (int) e2.getX();
        final int y2 = (int) e2.getY();
```

I don't think this is DSLV's 'fault', but it should be easy enough to fix.

This resolves some issues that were reported by users who missed the All Episodes view and used it instead of the Queue.

All things considered this is a fairly minor change. But some feedback would be welcome before we push it out to production.

Are there any other immediate changes we should include in 1.1.1?  My hope is to get this out quickly to help out folks that are currently broken, but if anything is missing and straightforward we could include it now (or in a 1.1.2).

So I wouldn't worry much about this, except that they say the that after the episode is downloaded it doesn't show up in the Queue.  My guess is that they don't have auto add enabled. But that's definitely not good behavior. Once #748 is published his overall issue should go away, but the queue, at least for him, isn't working the way it should. We should take a look at this.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Major missed use case: Managing everything from 'All Episodes',"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I think we missed a major use case of 'All Episodes'

```
All episodes listing removed No clue why it was removed, now I have to look at a list with barely visible episodes. The old listing was far better. Showed episodes and clearly showed what was new. Silly change for the sake of change. Nothing beneficial.
```

The user from #741 also seemed to care quite a bit about 'All Episodes'.

I think some users (not sure how many) weren't actually using the queue. They were just using All Episodes and playing things as they wished.  Our changes disrupted their workflow significantly.  We didn't notice this because we all play everything from the queue and thought of 'All Episodes' as a place to go simply to add things to the Queue.

I'd like to suggest the following changes for a 1.1.1 release (based on the version_1.1 branch):
- Instead of defaulting to the Queue view, we should really just display the last fragment the user was looking at when the app closed
- We should probably decrease or remove the amount of fading that happens to 'read' episodes in the 'New Episodes' list
- We should see if there are any low risk ways to implement some of @heckler01's suggestions from #721 (if there's no easy way it can wait for a more major update)

Tim:

```
Sad enough that you had to switch from the play list to ""all episodes"" every time you launch the app for a few months now, the ""all episodes"" lists is now missing completely. If I want to listen to an episode now, I have to search 3 lists to find it. This makes this great app almost unusable. Additionally, you have to scroll very, very carefully now not to swype one of the episodes out of the list.
Please bring back the ""all episodes"" list or at least have a switch in the settings to turn it on. I was so glad I found a good podcast app, finally, I don't want to move all my podcasts again.
```

Me:

```
Hi Tim,

The All Episodes list is still around, it's just called 'New Episodes'.  'New Episodes' defaults to showing only those episodes that haven't been added to the queue.  However, you can click the little three dots and clear the option that says to show new episodes only.

I wonder if you're using the app in a way that is somehow different from how most other people are using it.  Most people add episodes to the queue and listen to them from there.  You can configure the app to do this for you automatically if you like.
```

Tim

```
Thanks for your answer. I tried to use the app the way you proposed now and add the episodes I want to listen to to the playlist, but this release seems to be extremely buggy. E.g.
- Some of my podcasts were in the playlist, some are not, I could not figure out what rule is behind this. So I decided to start from scracht und delete the episodes in the playlist to start with an empty one and add the episodes I plan to listen to. A few seconds after I emptied the list, more and more seemingly random episodes appeared in the list again. If I swype episodes away from the playlist, these exact same episode appear again in the list (happened 4 times with one episode) after a few seconds or minutes. The list is constantly filled up with random episodes - and the app seems to start downloading these random episodes after adding them to the list.
- If ""swyping away"" multiple episodes in a row, the app reproducibly crases
- Some of my podcasts are automatically downloaded, some are not, even though I have ""automatic download"" enabled for all podcasts (but this problem also existed in previous releases)
- If I download podcasts manually in the ""new eposodes"" list, they are not marked as downloaded after the download (at least in 90% of the cases) - so I don't know which one I already downloaded
- As already said, swyping is much more sensive than in any other app, which always makes you swype episodes away when scolling. Undoing the operation does not bring back the episode, at least not until changing to another list and then opening the first list again.
- Loading the list sometimes takes minutes - or maybe the process hangs somehow. I never experienced that with the previous releases.

Maybe going back to the last stable release and fixing the bugs beforde publishing the new release would be a good idea. I really appreciate the work you do for a good, free opensource app, but on my part I cannot really use the app in this condition.
```

Me:

```
Hmm. We honestly haven't had those problems (crashes, random downloads, etc...) and have received mostly positive feedback regarding this release.

However, I'm certainly concerned. I'll be sure to relay these concerns to the rest of the team and we'll see what we can do.

I personally want to skip past episodes a lot, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want them removed from the queue.

I think ideally we could add track forward/back buttons that let you navigate in your queue without removing episodes when you do so.  These buttons (or at least forward) should be available on the widgets.  Additionally, it should be possible to configure bluetooth buttons to track forward/back instead of rewind/fast forward.  Does anyone else think such a thing is desirable?

A lower-effort method would be to simply expose 'Skip episode' as a button on the various player widgets.

Going forward, if anyone would like to contribute, the most valuable thing for me would be if you could build the proposed pull requests and test the functionality introduced in that request. If you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, just add a comment to the PR.  If everything works well, please comment saying that everything works well. That will give me more confidence when merging the requests.

Until now, seeking was only possible when the audio was actually playing. On newer devices, the seekbar is not updated properly in very rare cases. Most of the time, it works as intended.

Sometimes when I click the play button in the queue the episode starts playing, but more often it doesn't and I'm taken to playback and have to click 'play' from there again.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,More questions (and suggestions) about the cache.,"[Label(name=""discussion"")]","The way I use AntennaPod (or any podcast player) makes it important how episodes are deleted. My favorite way to limit space taken up by media is to be able to set a time limit on storing episodes: Do not keep any episode longer than 7, 14, 30 or 60 days for example. There's other fancier way of doing this but it would move AntennaPod towards settings bloat. 

The way it's done in AntennaPod is a bit confusing for me. I know that episodes are deleted when played becuase I have set them to, but what if I swipe the episode off the queue while playing because I'm not interested and move to the next episode? When will that episode be deleted? Also, is it possible that AntennaPod ""forgets"" episodes somehow and never delete them, or will all episodes above the set number be deleted? What happens if I add an episode to the media directory manually. Will AntennaPod ever notice that file and delete it? I am just trying to understand how it works since I seem to end up with more media stored than set for the cache limit (i use 40). Finally, an option to have any episode not in the queue deleted would be helpful.

I would not have to ask any of these questions if AntennaPod had the option to time limit storage like for instance (the bloated) BeyondPod has, so I think I would like to add such an option as a feature request.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Enhancement: Unsymmetric fast forward/backward,[],"In the menu you can set a fast forward/backward step width between 5 and 60 seconds. This value will be applied on both, forward and backward.

The most frequent use cases for fast forward/backward are (in my opinion/experience):
- you want to skip some less interesting passage and find a point to continue listening
- you want to repeat a passage of about the last minute, maybe you have not listened to concentrated enough and and you must find the exact starting point again

For both use cases an unsymmetric forward/backward step size which allows you to step forward coarse and find the exact point stepping backward fine.

For example Linux Totem Video Player uses this technique with fixed step sizes of +60s / -15s. It is very easy to find a desired point by this means.

My suggestion is to gives the possibility to selcet forward/backward step widths independantly by providing:
- separate inputs for both values - or - 
- an input for fast forward and an extra multiplier for backward ratio: 0.1 / 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 (optional additionally: 2 / 4 / 10)

For a while I have been fearing the possibility and now it has turned into a reality.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Add an 'Empty Queue' command,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","Consider the following use case:
- User is subscribed to a number of podcasts
- User's queue is full with previously downloaded podcasts

With the current model the user would have to manually remove all the episodes from the queue, one by one. That can be very time consuming and tedious with a long queue.

If there were a 'empty queue' or 'clear queue' command the user could issue that command, all the episodes in the queue would be removed and then, when the system auto-updates, the queue would be filled with the latest episodes from their various subscriptions.

Worthwhile?

Some of those were implement then or during the last few months and IMHO improved the usefulness of AntennaPod a lot.

I had hoped for another round of (esp. vertical) screen real estate savings in [0.9.9.5](https://github.com/danieloeh/AntennaPod/releases/tag/0.9.9.5), but alas: no.

Suggestions on where space can be shaved off individual items in any of the list views so that more items may be visible on the screen:
- move publishing dates and file sizes or play times respectively above and below the download or symbols
- shrink images to the height of 2 lines of main text (favicons in the browser are already much smaller and still server their recognition purpose; also, AntennaPod already has zoomed views for podcast and episode images in their respective views)
- extend playtime indicator line to left and right (matching play time on right below play symbol) so that it can act as a separator between episodes
- remove current separator lines & decrease spacing between items (also in sidebar)
- decrease all font sizes by 1 or 2 points

IMHO, 25-50% more episodes can be made accessible that way and the amount of scrolling reduced by the same margin, without compromising eligibility much.

I am running 0.9.9.4 and at the end of an episode Antennapod hangs.  Something bad happens at the end of [almost] every podcast I play.  Sometimes it just completely hangs, and I have to go terminate the process.  More often I get an ""Unknown Error"" which seems to be the default for almost all playback errors (playback_error_unknown).  Had the same problem on 0.9.9.3.  All file types are MP3.

The [almost] above is something like 90% of the time.  It rarely goes to the next podcast, but I think this may have happened a few times.  

This started after I installed the variable speed audio plugin - Prestissimo.  I had not used the plugin prior to 0.9.9.3, so I am not sure if it's related to any recent changes.  Or it could be entirely Prestissimo's fault.  Hard to know.

The biggest issue is that pushing the play button next to a podcast in the queue no longer plays the podcast. instead, it takes me to the playback screen of the currently playing podcast (which remains paused). I can push the play button in the queue repeatedly and sometimes after a few presses it will take me to the playback screen and I can hit play again and the cast plays, but sometimes it can be upwards of 20 presses. If there is not a podcast currently playing then I can switch to any other podcast. Sometimes I will get an playback error message and then the playback screen will come up empty and I can play a new podcast then.

Another (I'm guessing) related issue is that continuous playback is checked but when a podcast ends and a new one loads, it does not play automatically. Continuous playback is checked in the setttings.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,automatic adjustment of update interval,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello!

I'd like to collect some pros and cons about the default update interval & suggest an ""automatic"" option.

In my experience (heavy podcast listener, always a screen full for episodes in play-list), all podcatchers that do have a default interval, have a very short one. This causes unnecessary data usage & CPU load, also for the hosters. I'm in a podcast team myself and saw the logs. Many users (same IP & client) appear with hour intervals...

So, I usually activate the maximum pre-configured update interval. In AntennaPod this is 24h. Since there is probably no 1-interval-(range-)fits-all here, how about some kind of adaptive/automatic/dynamic setting? As default, not as yet another option ;-)

For example:
1. Take the existing intervals, but make them mean ""remaining playtime in queue), so that in my example, an auto-refresh would be triggered if the playtime drops below 24h (still respecting the ""Mobile update""-setting & WiFi filter).
2. Or, make the interval adjust itself to half, third, quarter (Let's discuss what's sensible here!) of queue playtime. Current, or averaged over a sensible time.
3. update feeds individually, when playback of last remaining episode in it starts

Please let me & us know what you think about this.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Often does not resume playback from where I was,[],"I love this app! But there's one bug that is getting me on the brink of switching.

It does not matter if I have played another episode since or if I just paused this episode, closed the app and came back later. Often the seeker is at the correct place, but when I hit play, it jumps either to the very begining of the episode, or to somewhere close to the beginning.

I've had this issue since the previous version of AntennaPod, and on two different phones with both stock Android and Cyanogenmod. I'm using 0.9.9.0 now, and it's the same.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,New UI: Some feedback,[],"Hi,
after the 0.9.9.0 release with the new UI became available on F-Droid I was finally able to test the new UI. Some feedback from my perspective:
- I like that there is finally a view that shows all downloaded items.
- Great that play list manipulation (moving up/down etc.) is much easier now. I seem to accidentally swipe off episodes too easily, but that may be just my clumsy fingers. Deletion on long press or context menu or so might be safer.
- Please bring back display of playing time and possibly release date and podcast name to items in the playlist. This seems to be only available in the Downloads/Finished view. Release date and podcast name should at least be avaibale from the episode detail view. But playing time is quite essential for me.
- One thing that feels really completely wrong is that in the All Episodes view, when trying to scroll up from the top of the list, a refresh of all podcasts is triggered. This alone makes this view completely unusable for me. Please note that this process can take quite some time and it seems that other parts (Playlist etc.) are not accessible at all. (I have a lot of podcasts and not the fastest device on the market.) IMO it should only be triggered explicitly and not accidentally when scrolling a list where one even cannot see whether one is at the top of the list or not. Even worse as when entering the app from the widget and clicking in the upper left of the player one ends up automatically in this view. Also there is the refresh button in the upper right, why should one be able to trigger this in another way? 

Anyway, please keep up the good work and thanks for releasing the software for free.

Edit: It would also be great if the number of contained episodes would be visible again at the top of the list as before.

One idea: Instead of having just the Play button to switch Play<->Pause, make this a three state button: Pause -> Play continuously -> Play until end of episode -> Pause. So when you just want to listen one episode press play twice and the player goes back to pause after the episode automatically; or just press once to play continuously, later press once to listen to end of episode or twice to pause immediately.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Ideas for code refactorings,[],"I have a few ideas for refactorings I’d like to run by the project. When I implemented OPML backup I saw some places where I think it would be beneficial for the app to “offload” functionality to other libraries and services. Less code (and sources of bugs) at the expense (possibly) of less control. Specifically,
1. EventDistributor can be replaced (or backed) with [LocalBroadcastManager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/LocalBroadcastManager.html) that ships with the support libaries
   
   This is a small change and would be straight forward to implement. The EventDistributor API could stay the same.
2. Use [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/) (or other library designed to download small files) to download feeds and images (it also does caching)
3. Use the [Download Manager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html) to download podcasts and videos
   
   Getting HTTP downloads right is not straight forward (AntennaPod has 8 classes for this purpose) and requires threads, locks, background services and notifications to work properly. Download Manager takes care of all that and does retries as well as handles connectivity failures. It is not clear that using Download Manager would work exactly the same as the current solution, but I think it will and I’m willing to give it a shot.

I appreciate all the time and effort that was put in to these parts of the app, and would totally understand if there's hesitation in changing them too much. The obvious reason not to is that it currently works. Also, these changes would not change how AntennaPod functions or looks. If, however, you think it’d be a good idea to simplify the code base then I would be interested in seeing if we can make it work. What do you think?

Every other day (like once a week or so) I browse through all the podcasts I have in my list and add the episodes I'm interested in to my playlist.

This is of course easiest done by selecting one source and going to all the new tracks there and then proceed with the next source. Therefore I then end up with a playlist that has the tracks in the order in which I have added them, i.e. with lets say 5 tracks from radio station _A_ then two from station _B_ and so on.

Especially with topics that are currently in the news it would be convenient if there was an option to sort the tracks chronologically by their release date. For example a menu (maybe also with other sort orders) in the ""organize playlist"" view could do that.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,impossible to disable downloading of episode images,[],"So, apparently the newest version downloads episode pictures. My issue is that most of my podcast provide an image for each episode (although it's apparently always just the logo/image of the podcast itself) and with some feeds containing 100+ or even 300+ episodes, I now have an ""images"" folder with 100+mb of completely useless copies of a few podcast images, and that was _after_ I quit the update by force-closing the app halfway through.

One example is ""Stop Podcasting Yourself"".. over 300 episodes and each one has a 500kb 1400x1400px jpg file. So the images from that podcast alone would use up ~150mb on my phone. And that's just one podcast. It's the most egregious example, but it's a problem with many feeds. Judge John Hodgman for example..150x152kb. Especially for people with limited data, actually doing that first refresh with the newest version can really screw you over (luckily I was on wifi). But even then, 100-200mb for pointless episode images is a waste considering the limited storage on most phones.

Additionally it seems like a download queue of 1000+ can crash the app.

There needs to be a way to deal with this and imho it shouldn't be default behavior, especially not on mobile data.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,feature idea: (randomly) play archive of podcast,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","When adding a new podcast feed, AntennaPod currently treats all existing episodes in that podcast as read. Only the next episode will be auto-downloaded by default. In order to accommodate the (not sure how common) use-case of discovering a new podcast and wanting to listen to it's archive, I suggest adding the options ""play archive"" to the show-information or already during the ""Add podcast"" process. If activated, a reasonable amount (maybe 50% of set episode cache size?) of old episodes from that feed get treated as new & therefore automatically downloaded. In chronological order starting with the oldest one. Here, [Podlove Paged Feeds](http://podlove.org/paged-feeds/) should be taken into account.

Another, IMHO less important use-case is wanting to listen to random old episodes from a podcast, or even from all subscribed podcasts. If the above feature idea of archive downloading is accepted, it would hopefully not be a big deal to also add a ""random archive download""-option, either to the show information screen of a podcast, or as a general setting.

In any case, the latest episode in a newly added feed should be treated as new, so that it get's shuffled into the waiting list or queue like any truly new episode.

I could not track down if it is related to some special event, but it only occurs if AntennaPod has not been used for at least several hours. I have the suspicion that it could be related to the fact that my phone sometimes (partially?) reboots which I do not necessarily notice every time it happens.

So, it's definitely an error with the feed. However, some RSS readers (for example, ownCloud News) _do_ parse it, XML error and all. Could some less harsh handling be added so that such podcasts could at least be added, or the error mitigated to some degree?

In this specific case, the error seems to be the & (rather than &amp;) in ""Leslee Thompson is the president & CEO of Kingston General Hospital"", which is enclosed withing a <description> tag; WebKit throws up the error ""xmlParseEntityRef: no name"" for that.

My reasoning is that almost all users will have this option ticked already, making the option redundant and just taking up space in the Settings screen.

But I don't think this rationale applies when you've added a new feed - in some cases, you'd probably need to start from episode 1 but you wouldn't necessarily want top add 200+ episodes to the queue.

For example, many educational podcasts will need to be listened to in order, as later episodes will use concepts introduced earlier ones. In my case, I have a beginners Spanish podcast that I've started listening to with a few hundred episodes already recorded and tracking where I'm up to is already a bit of a pain.

With this in mind, could we have an option when adding the feed to mark the entire feed unread?

I'm hoping to do the compile with gradle rather than eclipse, and it seems to me that this should work according to https://github.com/danieloeh/AntennaPod/wiki/Building-AntennaPod#building-on-the-command-line-with-gradle .

If the issue is a documentation error, and you can describe what I need to do here, I am willing to fix the docs too if I can reproduce that the solution works for me, too. Let me know. Thanks!

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Sort mecanism broken,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello,

Since yesterday, I can not sort episodes anymore.
It used to work fine.
Now, when trying to move an episode up or down: after following my finger, when I drop it where I wan it, the complete list flickers, then it goes back to its initial position.
I am using AntennaPod 0.9.7.4 on Android 4.1.2 since a few months.

What can I do, except uninstall / reinstall (and lose all my history) ?
Could it be a missing right on a file somewhere, lost for an unknown reason?
Thanks for your help.

The crashes used to only happen when downloading everything in my queue, but now it crashes even when I request an individual episode to be downloaded. If I increase the number of episodes allowed in my cache, I can then download specific episodes for a few days and then it starts force closing again.

I suspect this is caused by two inter-related issues.
- When the episode cache is full, it force closes instead of cancelling the download and providing some intelligent message to the user
- It appears not clean up download episodes after listening to them. I recently cleared dozens of old episodes out of my media folder that were not deleted when I completed listening to them. I suspect that some counter was not cleared when I deleted the files, so the application still thinks I'm at my limit of cached episodes.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Flattr queue autoflattr,[],"This implements a queue of pending things to flattr (similar to #203 but implemented in a slightly different fashion) and adds support for automatic flattring of played episodes as requested in #87.

The workflow for the user is:
- if autoflattr is enabled, whenever 80% of an episode have been played it is added to the flattr queue (and a toast is displayed)
- manual flattring is done directly (flattring things in the queue along the way) if there is an internet connection. Otherwise the thing is added to the queue.
- when the feeds are updated, things in the queue are flattred (presumably there is an internet connection at that point), an android notification is displayed. Also at that point the flattr status of things is updated from the flattr API

Database changes:
- new column flattr_status for the feed and feeditem tables containing the timestamp when the thing was last flattrd. This value is updated when antennapod flattrs, as well as based on data from the flattr API whenever the feeds are refreshed. The latter may not be 100% reliable as the URL antennapod gets from the feed is not necessarily exactly the one recorded by flattr and returned by their API. I implemented some URI normalization that catches the corner cases I have encountered, there may be more. Also the flattr api does not return information on flattrability (i.e. things that were flattrd last month), so this is done in Antennapod.

I have considered implementing the flattr queue as a list of URLs to flattr as you suggested in #203, but I think it would be a lot more work (i.e. one would have to walk through the entire queue and the list of things that have been flattrd just in order to determine if an item is flattrable (and the corresponding menu item should be shown, as well as in order to avoid trying to flattr things multiple times), similarly to retrieve the feed titles of the things flattrd for showing in the notification). 
- new column played_duration for the feedmedia table containing for how long an episode has been played (this is the accumulated play time, _not_ the current play position in the episode)

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,AntennaPod forgets about already downloaded podcast episodes,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","AntennaPod ""forgets"" the already downloaded files within a very short time no matter if the episodes are downloaded manually or by the automatic download function (which is working for me btw).

What happens:
Download progress is looking good. After successful downloading there is an indication (arrow down) the files are stored locally and I can play them offline. Fine. But after closing and restarting the app most of the time (not always) the little indication is gone and AntennaPod is offering the download option again. That's wrong.
It's more annoying if one is using the automatic download function. The podcast episodes are downloaded over and over again until the sd-card is full(?). After 60 minutes I had a lot of files like xxxxx-1.mp3 xxxxxx-2.mp3 xxxxxx-3.mp3 and so on...

1) Is there a way in which I can get AntennaPod to recreate the settings, etc, or should I just go ahead and add everything back in manually?

2) Where are the settings files stored that tell AntennaPod what I'm subscribed to, etc?

I have Update interval set to Manual, and I manually update feeds several times a day. Every couple of days or so, the app crashes during an update, usually if I try to do other operations within the app at the same time. I just go back in and retry and all is fine.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Atom feeds with multiple enclosures: wrong(?). file downloaded,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The Atom specification permits multiple files - one possible use for this is to do away with separate feeds for each podcast media format and include all available formats in a single feed.

In this case, AntennaPod appears to simply download whatever format (that is recognized) is last in the list. I created a test ""feed"" (valid single-entry atom xml file) with the media enclosures in the same format order I use for HTML5 audio <source> tags (i.e. preferred first). When the legacy mp3 format is last in the list, AntennaPod downloads the mp3 (skipping over the Ogg Vorbis version and the two other formats that it presumably doesn't recognize [opus and speex]). If I move the Ogg Vorbis version to the end of the list, the .ogg file is downloaded instead.

Short term: I would have expected it to instead default to the FIRST one (on the assumption that the ""preferred"" formats would be put first in the feed by the feed author, the same way users of the <audio> HTML5 tag do).

Long term (feature request): some sort of selection interface allowing download of any or all enclosures in at Atom entry (in addition to different formats of the same podcast media, multiple enclosures might also include ""supporting media"" such as diagram images, ""show notes"" text or pdf files, audio in different spoken languages, etc.)

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Variable Speed Playback,[],"Adding variable speed playback to the service.  This doesn't include any GUI functionality yet, as I feel like how that is implemented could be a bit more contentious.  I'll (or somebody else can) add that separately.

Explanation of changes:
The com.aocate stuff is a Presto client library that reimplements the MediaPlayer API while adding variable speed playback.  Unfortunately, it only provides audio.  Since I didn't want two different PlaybackService classes (one for audio, one for video) both doing mostly the same stuff, I created an interface called IPlayer that has all of the methods of the current MediaPlayer.  I then subclassed the aocate MediaPlayer as AudioPlayer and the android MediaPlayer as VideoPlayer, both implementing the IPlayer interface. They're essentially wrappers of their supertypes so that I could keep a consistent interface.

Since we can't reuse the same MediaPlayer object for audio and video files, I made a few additional changes to the PlaybackService to use a different MediaPlayer object for every file being played.

Both MediaPlayer classes have their own nested interfaces that both expect their own type.  In order to not duplicate callback code (i.e., one interface that takes com.aocate._.MediaPlayer, and one that takes android._.MediaPlayer, but otherwise have the exact same code), I added a DuckType class to essentially force the IPlayer interface onto those classes at runtime.  I adapted the class from here: http://thinking-in-code.blogspot.com/2008/11/duck-typing-in-java-using-dynamic.html

One problem with this implementation could be that in response to the removal of the item, the `FeedManager` might delete the item's media and start auto-downloading new episodes.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Reorder the Network settings,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","This issue is related to #135. A small reordering of the Network settings could make them clearer and avoid unwanted 3G usage. I think the Network settings should be as follows:

AUTOMATIC UPDATE
- Both on WiFi and 3G.
- Only on WiFi.
- Never update automatically (selected by default).

UPDATE INTERVAL (greyed out if automatic update is enabled)
- 1 hour / 2 hours / 4 hours / 8 hours / 12 hours / 24 hours.

AUTOMATIC DOWNLOADING OF ENQUEUED EPISODES
- Both on WiFi and 3G.
- Only on WiFi (selected by default).
- Never download enqueued episodes automatically.

AUTOMATIC STREAMING OF ENQUEUED EPISODES
- Checkbox: stream on 3G if it's their turn to play (unchecked by default).

EPISODE CACHE
- 10 episodes / 20 episodes / 40 episodes / 60 episodes / 80 episodes / 100 episodes.

WiFi FILTER
- Checkbox: treat unselected networks as if they were 3G.
- Checkboxes: list of known networks.

There are several advantages to this:

Data usage can be set more easily because you can set what the app can or cannot do while on 3G (and on WiFi) in a single field, without the need for an extra checkbox (as opposed to the ""mobile updates"" checkbox in the current version).

All related options are together, and unrelated ones are separate: the automatic update setting is next to the update interval, but far from the WiFi filter (because the latter affects several other things).

Last but not least, the ""Automatic streaming of enqueued episodes"" checkbox allows us to have a single action instead of the highly overlapping ""Download"" and ""Enqueue"", which is covered in #135.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Cleanup/Auto-Delete missing,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","HI,
I find there is one feature missing, that would make AntennaPod perfect and I believe it would be very easy to implement.

An option to either globally or on a per feed level to set:
- to keep only the last X episodes (e.g. keep only last 3 episodes and auto-delete older ones)
- to delete episodes older than X days (e.g. clean out old ones after 7 days, 30 days, etc)
- to keep all episodes (as it does now)

BeyondPod has this feature implemented, so have all PC-based podcatchers I have ever used (e.g. gpodder). With that implemented, one could run AntennaPod in fire-and-forget mode, without having to take care of deleting old content manually.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Problems with new interface (0.9.7+),[],"Hi there,

Version 0.9.7 was unusable but *.7.2 is much nicer.

But the new interface still has some issues:
- **Titles in lists are shorted**: That's not just a problem of podcast with stupid episode titles (like ""episode 45: something about the topic""), but also of podcast with complex topics (""Maskierte Mykotoxine - …""). And maybe a problems for languages with longer words or compounds. 
- **Play/Pause/forward/…-Buttons are tiny and don't use the given space**: In older Version the big Play/Pause-Button was VERY helpful. The button should be bigger and all buttons together should use the space efficiently.
- **It's hard to go from Cover to shownotes**: Thats really annoying, if you have a phone with a big screen or a short thumb its impossible to change between cover and shownotes. Please (re-)enable swipe there or make the whole ""title area"" (in the player) clickable, instead of just the little picture.
- **Remember state of cover ←→ shownotes**: If you change from cover to shownotes and lock your phone antennapod will display the cover, or if you go to the playlist and then back to the player. Thats really annoying. （╯°□°）╯︵(\ .o.)\   And please the position of the shownotes, so you don't have to scroll AGAIN if you where in the playlist and the shownotes are ""scrolled back"".
- **Global Sleeptimer**: The Sleeptimer should be reachable via GUI from everywhere (playlist, player episode, details, podcast list) and also be global. Now: If you say 30 min in the sleeptimer and your episode ends after 10 min the sleeptime disappears: (ಠ_ಠ)
- **Playlist jumps to the start**: We had this bug several versions ago. So: If you play number 10 in the playlist and the episode ends, antennapod jumps to number 1 in the playlist, not 11 (or 10 which would be away) .

But at all the new interface is more efficient. I don't tap as often as before. ʘ‿ʘ

Greetings and sorry for this heap of bugs.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Fix date format parsing,[],"I came across this bug because ""Waiting List"" was not sorted properly. Then i realized it was a date parsing problem with some feeds.

Short year format specification works in both cases. Long year didn't. You can check docs if you want:

The code has been tested with both types of year spec:
- Long format like ""2013"", which worked both before and after the patch. Eg: http://feeds.feedburner.com/droidcast/
- Short format like ""13"", which parsed nonsense timestamps (literally year 13 A.D.) before patch and now works. Eg: http://www.ivoox.com/portada-ivoox_fh.xml

danieloeh/AntennaPod,open,Allow addition of local files to queue,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","I mainly use AntennaPod to listen to podcasts I subscribed to, but from time to time I also listen to mp3 files I have on my SD card (an old podcast which closed but made all its archives available).

So I suggest the following feature: **allowing user to add local files to the queue**, these files being stored locally.
I see different ways to do this:
- Manually, the user would browse to a directory, then select one or several files to add to the queue (selecting several files should be possible).
- Allowing the addition of a new kind of feed by giving a local directory: AntennaPod would check this directory to see if files have been added, and then treat them as a classic feed.

I know it is possible to open a file with AntennaPod from the file manager, but this way does not allow one to build a listening list (the queue) with episodes both from classic feeds and from local files.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Auto-download and auto-enqueue should be separated,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","I love having the new auto-download feature, but I find that the auto-enqueuing of auto-downloaded podcasts is a bit too aggressive. I like being able to create a playlist from the available podcasts. While I might be interested in a podcast in general, certain episodes may not strike my fancy, and I like being able to leave them out of the playlist. But with the new auto-downloading, I don't seem to have that ability.

I had only used AntennaPod for a few days before this update, but I remember there being a setting to enqueue podcasts when they were downloaded. This allowed me to see a list of available podcasts in the ""Waiting List"" section, and then add specific ones of them to the ""Queue"" section as they interested me.

I like auto-downloading, though, so what seems ideal to me is for podcasts to be auto-downloaded into the ""Waiting List,"" but allow for manual enqueuing -- possibly by returning the option to enable/disable enqueuing downloaded podcasts.

I hope that makes sense. I really think AntennaPod is great! Thanks for all your hard work.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Episodes should auto-queue in order oldest to newest (or allow configuring the order),"[Label(name=""feature request"")]","The current behavior seems to queue newest episodes first, which can be a little bit confusing/jarring when you finish listening to recent episodes, and suddenly jump backward in time.

I imagine that not all users would prefer doing it this way, it might be best to have this configurable, possibly with a per-feed option and a global default.

I see two primary listening scenarios:
1. The user wants to listen to every episode on the subscription in the order which they come  out.
2. The user has more feeds than can all be followed, and wants to listen to whatever is recent. In this case, older episodes could eventually fall off the list

I suppose there is also the potential for wanting to listen to everything, _and_ wanting to hear them newest to oldest, but I'm not sure what the prevalence for that is (and maybe I am actually in the minority).

This could work nicely with #71 as well, with the priority taking precedence, then date-time ordering.

To manage that the app shouldn't wait until the user opens it and presses Refresh. It should keep working in the background, checking for new episodes every so often (Daily? When the phone is charging and on WiFi?) and if it finds them, enqueue and download them automatically.

The user would just have to flick their finger to the left or right, and the episode is dismissed. Unlistened episodes (that is, those the user never even started listening) would be deleted and forgotten, and listened ones (even partially listened ones) would be skipped and go to the History.

It could even be used at the top of the queue (that is, on the current episode) to skip the current episode and start listening to the next one, which would be an easy way to implement Skip without having to use extra buttons or UI elements.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Use a dropdown instead of tabs,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Here's a couple mockups of AntennaPod if it used a dropdown to move between sections instead of tabs:

![Dropdown](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/244538/7dcedcc8-8a68-11e2-93a1-4ab5c43ddf8d.png)

I have several reasons to think that this would be better than we have now:
- First, it would save space. Once you have subscribed to the desired podcasts (and once auto-download and auto-enqueue are implemented) the user shouldn't really have a lot of reasons to switch between sections. He will probably spend most of the time in the Episodes section, so I think that the saved space will become more important than being able to change sections quickly.
- Second, it would allow to move the History section into the dropdown. Which, being a section and not an action, I think would make more sense than having it inside the overflow menu.
- Third and most important, it would allow to swipe episodes away. Unwanted episodes could be dismissed very quickly, with the flick of a finger. Which will become very important once new episodes are added automatically to the waiting list. It's important to note that swiping away is impossible with the current approach because horizontal movement just changes sections.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Reserve some space to cache enqueued items and to keep listened ones.,[],"Several issues suggest using auto-download. In order to have that we need the app to do the following:
- Devote some of the phone's memory to store podcasts when they are added to the playing queue.
- Erase already listened episodes in order to make room for new ones.

This brings two problems:
- There needs to be a way to decide how much space is given.
- Episodes shouldn't be erased IMMEDIATELY after being listened, because if you like an episode and want to listen to it again you would have to use additional data. As a result, there needs to be a way to decide how much space is given to listened episodes.

Therefore, two settings are needed:
- Disk space for cached episodes (by default: 10%).
- Disk space for listened episodes (by default: 5%).

If you had a phone with 8GB memory AntennaPod would automatically download and enqueue new episodes until they reached 800MB, at which point it would stop. Additionally, listened episodes would be kept until they reached 400MB, at which point the older ones would be deleted from the memory.

A user with a lower-end phone but really into podcasts could use those settings in order to devote more space.

"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Remove the ""Downloads"" screen.","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","If #116 is implemented there won't be any need for a Downloads screen. It will be easy to spot episodes being downloaded, because they will always be either in the playing queue or in the top spots of the waiting list.

If you give them a ""downloading"" icon and a download progress bar (similar to the progress bar in half-listened items) seeing what downloads are taking place will be so simple right on the main screen that Downloads will be able to be removed, thus simplifying the interface and without losing anything.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Simplify the long-press menu,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This issue is related to #116 because it implies the workflow suggested there.

When you long-press an episode you get a lot of options that could be simplified:

![Screenshot_2013-03-07-16-50-09](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/232777/7ef0850a-8740-11e2-9aaf-15b31a01ae58.png)

In that screenshot:
- ""Remove"" deletes the file but leaves the episode in the playing queue.
- ""Remove from queue"" returns the file to the waiting list, but keeps the file in the phone.

If #116 is implemented neither of the above would make sense because being in the queue imply being downloaded, and the other way around. But we do need:
- A ""Remove"" option that completely deletes the file and makes the app forget about the episode. This should apply to items in the queue, waiting list or history. Also, in addition to a long-press action this could be triggered by swiping the episode away.
- An ""Add to queue"" option that takes items from the waiting list or the history and adds them to the bottom of the playing queue. Also, of course, sets them to be downloaded ASAP.
- Optionally some ""Return to waiting list"" and ""Move to history"" options for items in the queue. I don't think I would want these, though: once you move an episode to the queue you probably won't want to move it back unless you've lost your interest and don't want to listen to it anymore, in which case it would be simpler to just swipe it away and be done with it.
- ""Mark as read"" removes the ""new"" banner.
- ""Mark as unread"" adds it again.

I find these largely irrelevant and, unless I've misunderstood their function, I don't think they're worth two slots in the long-press menu.

Therefore, if you long-press an item in the playing queue I think that you should get these options:
- Play, which moves the episode to the top and starts playing it.
- Remove, already explained.

And if you long-press an item in the waiting list or history you should get:
- Play.
- Remove.
- Add to playing queue, which adds it to the bottom of the queue.

In addition to that, It could be useful to show these options as buttons on the bottom bar so that you can apply them to several items at once. Here's a quick mockup:

![Antennapod](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/233013/00638e92-8747-11e2-8fd0-dd6cf3057409.png)

As you see the mockup shows several selected items and three buttons at the bottom bar, which correspond to Play, Remove and Add to queue.
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Try a card interface,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This suggestion is related to #79 and #116 because it uses a single queue and doesn't distinguish between new and old episodes, but downloaded and undownloaded.

I think that switching to a card interface would make the queue look cleaner and make it easier to delete unwanted episodes:

![Antennapod](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/226933/111fa5a4-8648-11e2-97a1-1d5f7791bdfa.png)

As you see, each episode is separated from the rest and all the relevant data appears in a clean way: you can see the episode's title and channel, as well as duration and progress (except for undownloaded episodes, which show their size instead).

Similarly to #79, the episode being played is shown at the top of the queue. Its card is a bit bigger than the rest and shows some extra data. It also has a bigger proggress bar that lets you scroll through the episode.

As specified in #116 all new episodes are added to the bottom of the ""Undownloaded"" list. As you listen to the ones at the top they get deleted, making room, and the ones at the top of ""Undownloaded"" are downloaded and moved to the bottom of the ""Downloaded"" list, so that you know that you can listen to them without using any mobile data.

You can browse through the whole list and if any particular episodes don't attract you you can simply swipe them away and make room for new ones, which is one of the main benefits of the card interface.

If you're browsing through the Undownloaded episodes and you see one that you like you can long-press it and choose to ""Play"" it (which moves it to the top of the Downloaded list and starts playing it right away) or ""Download"" it (which moves it to the bottom of the Downloaded list).
"
danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,"Instead of ""Queued"" and ""New"", use ""Downloaded"" and ""Undownloaded""",[],"I don't think I have ever fully grasped what a ""New"" episode is. I guess it's new because it's been added recently? How recently? When does a new episode stop being new? Do I need to listen to it for it to become old, or does it automatically after some time?

This suggestion is kind of related to #79 in that new and old episodes are added to the same list. The suggestion is to do away with the concept of ""New"" episodes and replace it with a concept much easier to grasp: ""Downloaded"" vs. ""Undownloaded"" episodes.

![49d18e40-8511-11e2-9a30-e8ca5e71401c](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/226725/5f90703c-863f-11e2-9f05-a23eed6ed085.png)

The idea is that you have only one queue, and all new episodes are added to the bottom of that queue. The ones at the top are downloaded automatically when you have a WiFi connection, and then deleted after you listen to them in order to make room for new ones.

That way you always have fresh new episodes ready to be listened without having to use 3G data, and you never have to worry about which ones you download because the application takes care of that by itself.

Why separate downloaded episodes from undownloaded ones, then, if it's just one list? To let you know which ones you can listen to without using your data connection. That way, if there is one episode that attracts you in the ""Undownloaded"" section you can download it while you're at home, which will add it to ""Downloaded"" and let you listen to it on the go.

Old, listened items are removed automatically and make room for new ones to be downloaded (also automatically) and added to the list.

This way, supposing I have already subscribed to a selection of feeds that I like, I can keep listening to new episodes without ever worrying to check for new episodes, or having to download newer ones or reorder the list, or even ever leaving the ""Episodes"" screen.

Perhaps is would help adoption of the app if the user could easily import their existing podcast subscriptions in Listen. I know nothing of what is involved in implementing such a feature, or if it is even possible.

I believe a similar feature exists in Firefox for Android, where bookmarks and cookies can be imported from ""Browser"".

For me it shows up correctly in the feeds tab

Then add

""http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/writersandco.xml""

No new feed appears, but podcasts for the second feed start to appear in the list for the first. To me this seems to be incorrect behaviour.

 Perhaps the URL used for the first feed is being replaced with the second -- I can't tell from what I'm seeing. You can reverse the order of adding the feeds -- the first feed added appears, the second always gets ""added"" to the first. If either feed is on a _different_ host (for example NPR) two separate feeds are created and seem to work correctly.

Perhaps the problem is that both of these XML files contain the link to the same site: ""http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting"", even though they are different and separate feeds.

Thanks again.

I think headset controls would make this app even better. Even as basic as just play/pause would be great.

Also would there be a way to automatically clear the refresh/download notification or an option to not show them at all?

Thanks

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,No Downloadable Files Found for some Podcasts,[],"First of all: Let me thank you for this app, just what I was waiting for!

However there is a small issue with two of my podcasts which might be somehow related to #14. Or maybe not. AntennaPod cannot find downloadable files in the following feeds:
- http://ulm.ccc.de/dev/radio/podcast-ogg.xml
- http://www.duden.de/feed/podcast

In the latter case this might be a problem with the feed since  [SwallowCatcher](http://webworxshop.com/projects/swallowcatcher) cannot handle that one either.

Thank you very much in advance for fixing this issue.

danieloeh/AntennaPod,closed,Feature Request,[],"Hi,

in my eyes has your software the most potential to will the best podcast app on android market. :)
1. Playlist Support (minimum Audio and Video Podcast playlist)
2. podcast will delete after listen 
   2.a. mark podcast to hold on the phone
3. ""cloud"" sync for multiple devices
4. Video Playback (i can not test it on my phone during crashes)

i hope you will bring much more tools on the app.

regards,
Thomas
