andybotting/tramhunter,open,homescreen widget for favourite stops,[],"Feature: homescreen widget for favourite stops (#14)
Add a homescreen widget/shortcut to a favourite stop to your homescreen, via the favourites context menu. This will need a new icon, at the moment it's using a very blurry star!

Future enhancement: support android 7.1 app shortcuts (by pressing on the launcher icon)

Also:
-Use `headboardRouteNumber` instead of `routeNo` so it shows route 3a instead of 4 (which you can only notice on weekends!)
-Fix some lint issues with menu item action view (would cause issues on Android<11)

andybotting/tramhunter,closed,Don't crash when Yarra builds new tram stops,[],"For example, YT build a new tram stop (3022) for rt 58 to Toorak at Toorak Rd.  `TramRunActivity` would crash because the stop was null. Now it will show as `Unknown stop (3022)` instead.

(The other way to fix this is to update the db, remove the Park St and Domain Rd stops, rename stop 1561, insert stop 3022. But stops can only be inserted after YT builds them)."
andybotting/tramhunter,closed,New feature: Enter vehicle number,[],"New dialog to enter a vehicle number, and go to the `TramRunActivity`. Reused the search button on the home screen for now (can still use the search button in action bar for other searches).
Changed the dialog import to use `android.support.v7.app.AlertDialog`, so updated the About dialog style to match.
Changed `TramRunActivity` to prepend tram class in title bar, and navigate to `StopDetailsActivity` on stop click."

andybotting/tramhunter,open,Disruption messages never displaying,[],"When Yarra Trams make a service disruption notice active in tramTRACKER (shown in yellow), this information is never displayed in Tramhunter. This affects all tram routes and has been an ongoing issue for some time now.
Service updates (which appear to be a different category of message, appear in orange in Tramtracker) do get shown in Tramhunter, however the icon for these (exclamation mark) is more like an icon that would be used for a disruption, not an update.

andybotting/tramhunter,closed,"Departure times, Route 75 towards city",[],"Instead of showing the time to departure as usual, the stops on Route 75 (towards the city) are showing what look like the departure times from Camberwell Depot. Examples: all times begin with ""Camberwell Depot"" and then give times like Sat 12.22 am, Sat 12.41 am, Sat 12.55 am. Refreshing the screen and removing the stop from Favourites then reinstating it doesn't do anything. I looked at a few stops on the same route going towards Vermont South and they don't seem to be affected; just the city bound ones. Thanks!

andybotting/tramhunter,open,Widget support?,[],"Hi, just wondering if you've considered some kind of widget for this app? Being able to use Wearable Widgets to put my tram times on my watch so I don't need to keep checking my phone would be an absolutely killer feature. Being able to simply glance at your home screen would also be great. Are there any plans to add a feature like this?

andybotting/tramhunter,closed,Extremely slow compared to TramTracker,[],"Over the past few months, I've noticed that Tram Hunter has been loading stop information a LOT slower than usual, ranging from 8-40+ seconds on average. In some cases it loads within a few seconds, but most of it time it takes longer. I've replicated the results on both 3G and WiFi. The official TramTracker app loads this information in just a few seconds.

andybotting/tramhunter,closed,Here it goes,[],"I saw you are using the 2.2 API.
I guess my ADT plugin replaced your `default.properties` with `project.properties`. They have the same content, just different names.

I also did not checkin the new `.classpath` file. Not sure if it will cause any problems on your end - it shouldn't - but it's a bit different from what you have.

Anyway.. hope it all makes sense :-)

Cheers
