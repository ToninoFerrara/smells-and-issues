mborjesson/LG-Optimus-2X-Black-Notifications,open,[Feature request] Option to disable notification when proximity sensor is active,[],"Hello,
I use this app with my Optimus 4X (P880) and find it very useful!
However, i think it would be great if there was an option to stop notifications as long as the proxmity sensor is active. Background: The cover I use for my phone has a lid which can protect the display. If the lid is closed I cannot look at the keys and therfore see no notifications, of course. This would save battery when I don't need the service.
Thanks for considering my suggestion!

mborjesson/LG-Optimus-2X-Black-Notifications,closed,adding support for P930 with JellyBean/CM10,[],"It seems the location of the control file (referenced in TouchLEDP930.java) has moved in JB/CM10  to
""/sys/devices/platform/msm_ssbi.0/pm8058-core/pm8058-led/leds/button-backlight/brightness""

my patch was to create and update TouchLEDP930jb.java with the correct file reference along with required  TouchLED.java changes. 

This is my first github commit, so hopefully I did not mess up too much! 
thanks

For some strange reasons I needed to change one thing in Txt src/com/martinborjesson/o2xtouchlednotifications/feedbacks/TouchLEDService.java as there were a problem with getting settings (I've made a change in such a way it should not broke any other devices), but mby I've done something terribly wrong :/
