thuryn/your-local-weather,closed,Manual update of current weather is very slow in 3.0.16,[],"There seems to have been a regression of sorts that appeared in release 3.0.16.

I have YLW configured on my tablet for manual location and manual update of the weather (as it is rarely more than a few feet/meters from my easy chair).  Ever since release 3.0.16, manual update of the weather by swiping down is _very, very, very slow_! It used to take maybe a couple seconds, now the ""busy"" indicator (the spinning wheel) goes for several minutes or more.

Without digging into the code, my guess is something is perhaps amiss with synchronization of the ""busy"" indicator with the actual update, download status.

A work around I discovered is to start the current weather update by swiping down, then go into the menu and switch to either ""daily forecast"" or ""graphs"" which update quickly, then go back to ""current weather"". The spinning wheel is gone, and the updated current weather info is there. That fact in itself might help debug the issue...

#### Components
Your-local-weather is a great application that makes getting weather reports and weather forecasts very easy, simple and fast. 

I have some suggestions that can make this application more useful to its users. 

#### Proposal
It is of great benefit to me, and some other users out there that the application provides a means where i can easily share the weather report of my location to any body that i wish to share it with. ![reports](https://i.imgur.com/PRz4x1z.jpg)

But unfortunately, this application doesn't provide a means where i can share the weather forecast of my location, and its not really pleasing to know. ![forecast](https://i.imgur.com/hNjhY6K.jpg) 

Therefore, i am proposing that this application creates/provides a means where users can share the weather forecast to people that people that they wish to share it with. 

#### Mockups / Examples
The developer can add a share button for forecasts reports to the application like this:
![example](https://i.imgur.com/U3EOsYa.jpg) 


#### Benefits
Including this feature to this application will avail the users with the opportunity to share the weather forecast of their location.

Other apps show icon correctly.

thuryn/your-local-weather,closed,Update by accelerometer wise default?,[],"I have no concrete proof, but I suspect that the update by accelerometer method is a huge battery drain.

Strangely, Android doesn't seem to record any useful data in the battery section of settings, but I have observed a rapid decrease in battery life when Your Local Weather updated to use accel by default.

Switch back to my preferred setting, ""update every hour"", and my battery life improves greatly. 

Maybe accel update shouldn't be the default?"

thuryn/your-local-weather,closed,Quit nagging me to enable GPS,"[Label(name=""Accepted feature request""), Label(name=""Fixed/waiting for release""), Label(name=""bug"")]","This might be semi-related to #21.

I run LineageOS and only turn on features like bluetooth and GPS when I want them, so my GPS is disabled most of the time. 

When I have my GPS disabled and I open the app, it nags me to go into phone settings and re-enable GPS. It's easy enough to get around this by just tapping somewhere not on the nag dialog, but it's annoying. When I want to update the location, I'll turn on GPS and press the 'detect location' button.

I tried telling it not to update the location, but in that mode the 'detect location' button disappears and it resets the location to london.

I can see how prompting the user to turn on GPS might be useful, but I'd like a setting to turn off that nag screen so that I can just update my location manually and not be bugged to enable GPS every time I want to see a forecast.

Thanks for your time :)

thuryn/your-local-weather,closed,How to help with translations + tutorial text?,[],"Hey, happy user of the app here! 

The widget works perfectly fine so I almost never open the app ""properly"". I just did for the first time in ages, and being greeted by a detailed tutorial was a pleasant surprise! A few settings that I was not aware of were explained, and the app is now better tweaked to what I want it to do. Love it :)

There were a few spelling errors, for example: _""**cashing** found locations""_ instead of _""**caching** found locations""_. Also a few quirky idioms.

I figured *""Hey, I can help there! I'll just look up the text files in the source, edit them and send a pull request!""* (mind you, I'm not an Android dev - building this from scratch would be too much hassle.
