billthefarmer/accordion,open,Improve F-Droid listing,[],"I've seen this app on F-Droid, but it lacks screenshots, changelog and a translatable description there. It's pretty easy for you to add these information. Please have a look at [this example](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/tree/master/fastlane/metadata/android) or at the [F-Droid docs](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/#in-the-apps-source-repository) or [fastlane docs](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/2.28.7/supply/README.md#images-and-screenshots).
After you have commited these files to your repo and tagged a new version, you need to remove the `Description` and `Summary` from the metadata file in the [F-Droid Data repo](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata)."

billthefarmer/accordion,closed,Feature request: motion sensing billows,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The app does not currently seem to change the sound when I move the tablet as I play. It'd be very fun if it could make the in-and-out noises based on the gyroscopic motion sensor. As an added benefit, anyone could strap their tablet to their hand and play the Air Accordion. (Which is so much cooler than an air guitar.)

billthefarmer/accordion,closed,where is the libsonivox.so file?,"[Label(name=""question"")]","The readme says
Get a copy of the libsonivox.so library from an Android device or an emulator (in system/lib) and put it with the other libraries in the platforms/android-14/arch-arm/usr/lib folder of the NDK.

I have Android Studio on OS X Yosemite. I am trying to build for the emulator. Where is this system/lib directory exactly?
