ikarus23/MifareClassicTool,open,4k -> 1K - Trimmed clone question,[],"Hello there! greetings from Colombia.

**Here's my situation** (I'm by no means a programmer, more like a scrip kiddie)

1. I'm able to perform a full dump (known keys) of a 4k mifare card but using my phone (with this app) and my linux machine (libnfc)
2. Using the app, I'm able to write the dump into a 1k card (trimming sectors 16-39).
3. The 1k cloned card works.
4. When I compare the dumps (original 4k vs trimmed 1K) sector 0 and sector 15 differ slightly.
5. When I try to clone the cloned 1k card with the Linux machine (miLazyCracker) if dumps successfully, but when trying to write into another 1k tag, I get an error regarding SAK code.

**So here are my questions:**
1. Is there a better way to trim clone a 4k tag dump into a 1k tag? (when the remaining sectors are not used).
2. How could the APP dump txt files be converted into a LIBNFC compatible MFD dump file?.
3. How could the APP ingest/import LIBNFC mfd dump files?.
4. Wishful thining: Could miLazyCracker libraries be included on this app? it's performance is greater than MFOC and MCFUK and could actually be practical.

Thank you!

Thank you for your commitment to improving the application.

I have a question about how to use the application on Motorola Moto G5s Plus.

Apparently the Moto G5s Plus uses the same NFC chip as the Moto G5 plus (I read that it works), but when trying to read a tag, even if all the passwords are the same, some passwords (when reading the tag) appear blank as if had not been found.
Sometimes it returns as if it did not find industry passwords and was not displayed.

I think it's a mistake, because if I read it again, it reads the password it did not read and stops reading another password.

Moreover, also need to know should I proceed with Ndef or MifareClassic for my purpose.

I recently bought a Nexus 5X to continue the MCT development on a newer platform (my Nexus 7 2012 has Android 5.1.1 and there will be no updates). However, I experience a really strange behavior and was not able to figure out what is causing it.

* I have clean, factory formatted tag (all key are FFFFFFFFFFFF).
* If I read it with my Nexus 7 2012, everything is just fine.
* If I read it with my Nexus 5X, some sectors appear to be not readable.
* If I read it with my Nexus 5X again, some different sectors appear to be not readable. The readable sectors vary from read to read.

As far as I have looked into it, the two reasons for a sector to appear unreadable.
* Sometimes the sector is not readable  because no key was found (the authentication fails even with the correct key).
* Sometimes it is not possible to read the sector (even though the key is correct).

ikarus23/MifareClassicTool,open,Key extraction from chinese sniffer cards,"[Label(name=""feature"")]","There is a chinese sniffer card available (see http://www.proxmark.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1649 ) that logs the tag nonce and reader response, which can then be extracted and used for key recovery. Instead of the windows application tied to a specific NFC reader, it would be easier to use an app for key recovery instead.

I found that it's possible to use NfcA API to extract the needed information from the card by sending the raw commands, i.e.:

```
NfcA n = NfcA.get(tagFromIntent);
n.connect();
byte[] rats={(byte) 0xe0, 0x50}; // no checksum, (byte) 0xbc, (byte) 0xa5};
n.transceive(rats);
byte[] a={ 0x0a,  0x00,  0x00, (byte) 0xa6, (byte) 0xb0,  0x00,  0x10};

byte[] br  = n.transceive(b);
```

After DES-decrypting ar and br, getting the tag nonces and reader responses, key recovery can then be performed with the mfkey32 tool, or a java reimplementation.

Would this be an interesting/possible addition to MCT, or do you think it would be better as a separate app?

I have a factory new, standard mifare 1k tag, with default access conditions (all F's.).
It can be read with a keyfile consisting of two keys:
FFFFFFFFFFFF
000000000000

However if I reverse the keys:
000000000000
FFFFFFFFFFFF

then MCT now reports the key as being 0s, not Fs.
If swap the last digit from a 0 to a 1, then the F key is found correctly.

Even more strange:

I saved a dump of a reading with 0 keys, and write it back to the card, i.e., access key is 000000000000 for A and B for all sectors. Now I cannot read it back (no valid keys found). So I try changing the order in the keyfile (first F, then 0), some other variants, no luck, card cannot be read.

Using another phone, same MCT version, the card can be read using key 0, then reprogrammed using key F, and then read by the first phone again.

MCT version 2.0.4, first phone is Xperia Z3 Compact, Android 5.0.2 (21.1.A.1.28) which had problems.

Working phone was MCT 2.0.4, Samsung Galaxy S3 (i9300), Android 4.4.4 (CM11-M12) which worked OK.

> I wanted to add something to this idea: namely, the ability to use key-files that can specify which sectors they apply to, which should accelerate, or obviate key-mapping. The idea is to specify which key-files to use for reading/writing dumps. If using specified Keys on targeted sectors does not work, the default behaviour should be to fall back to building key-maps as it does today, on a per key/sector basis. e.g. say the user specifies targeted keys for 0A, 0B and 1B, but needs to read 0A, 0B 1A, 1B, 2A 2B. Those keys could be tried for the other sectors as necessary, especially if there are no other keys in the file.
