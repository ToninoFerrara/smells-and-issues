A month or so ago my total downloads fell to 0. I've tried deleting all data and resyncing but all of the rest comes in save for the downloads and active installations.

What could be the cause ?

I've drawn up a couple of versions, [the first](https://adapticon.tooo.io/#/bg=https://imgur.com/download/XV0XoM7/fg=https://imgur.com/download/eQy3FDx) is trying to keep in line with the current logo.

However, since it's impossible to run our copy of the app (then no step by step debug is possible) I'd like someone, if possible, to explain how the app authenticate and how it is allowed to access the web page (the only thing I've not figured out yet).

I'll be creating an open-source repo for the API in Java.

Thank you in advance."

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,No published apps found,[],"I was checking my google account security settings: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions

I noticed that Andlytics had ""full access to your Google Account"", which is more than any other app has (except Chrome).

I thought (hoped) that perhaps Andlytics may have needed this in the past, but has since made improvements to only request minimum permissions to access Play Store app data.

So, I removed this access in the security settings.

Then I uninstalled Andlytics from my phone and reinstalled it from the Play Store.

I opened Andlytics and selected my Google account: the only one on my phone, and the same one I was using before.  It's not a ""Google Apps for Business"" account, and not linked to multiple developer consoles.

It displays no apps, and says ""No published apps found"".

Any clue how I can get this working again?  I saw one other issue (https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics/issues/735)  where somebody had to remove and re-add their Google account on the phone, but I'm hoping I don't have to do that."

Would it also be possible for the app to notify me when there are Force Closes and ANR's for any of my apps? It's crazy the Play Store doesn't already have that feature built in.

I cloned the repo and when I run it I get:

`Unrecoverable authentication exception: UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE`

So I then created my own oauth2 client credentials using my own keystore and sha1 and then I get this error:

Sow what else do I need to change?

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Convert line endings from CRLF to LF.,[],"- This commit introduces no code change!

Please do not commit files with Windows line endings (CRLF) since this causes a permanent **full-file-diff** on *nix machines. The Git config can be setup to automatically convert line endings back and forth on a Windows machine.

> Formatting and whitespace issues are some of the more frustrating and subtle problems that many developers encounter when collaborating, especially cross-platform. It’s very easy for patches or other collaborated work to introduce subtle whitespace changes because editors silently introduce them, and if your files ever touch a Windows system, their line endings might be replaced. Git has a few configuration options to help with these issues.
> 
> `core.autocrlf`
> 
> If you’re programming on Windows and working with people who are not (or vice-versa), you’ll probably run into line-ending issues at some point. This is because Windows uses both a carriage-return character and a linefeed character for newlines in its files, whereas Mac and Linux systems use only the linefeed character. This is a subtle but incredibly annoying fact of cross-platform work; many editors on Windows silently replace existing LF-style line endings with CRLF, or insert both line-ending characters when the user hits the enter key.
> 
> Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when you add a file to the index, and vice versa when it checks out code onto your filesystem ...

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,open,Error in data reporting,[],"Hi,

I have noticed that if the Play Store fails to update finance data daily then the app will log the same revenue as the last reported date as the current date. The Play Store had a 3 day delay until it updated for my finance data and so now the app is reporting 4 days as exactly the same revenue rather than fetching the new data.

Could you implement a historical data fetch so that if such a thing happens we can force it to refetch the data for X amount of previous time. Otherwise if it keeps reporting incorrect data is becomes a bit useless.

Thanks,
Daniel

We can either:

1) Remove support (and possibly update the directory structure)
2) Leave support in, but don't update libraries/build files
3) Keep supporting Eclipse/Ant

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Fake new stats comment update,[],"The past couple of days I've gotten updates on a new comment over 10 times per day. It says +1 but when I click to read it there is no new comment and when I press back the counter is decreased by one usually. Sometimes it's not and then instead in the next update (usually within a few minutes) there is a -1. Only one time during these days I've gotten a real comment, it worked like normal (+1 and there was a comment to read).

I suspect that its not Andlytics fault but that Google is doing something strange.

Couldn't one solution be to compare the ""new comment"" with the latest and if they are the same, don't show any notification? This would of course not work if the ""new comment"" is empty.

Anyhow, a solution to this is much appreciated as the before happy feeling of seeing an update from Andlytics has turned into a ""noo, not again!"".

I've commented on Google Play about this issue and was asked to open a thread here. I'll quote my text from there:

The app I'm referring to is http://goo.gl/CiY6s. Weirdly, since the counter got to 4500 comments, it stopped incrementing, even though I was still receiving (and answering) new comments via Andlytics.

I tap it, and it goes directly to my developer console in the browser, without any need to enter any password or other type of authentication.

But Andlytics always fails to login anyway. I've also tried to delete all data for Andlytics to start over, but it gives the same thing.

I have two accounts on the phone, if that matters. Only one of them have apps published, and that's the one I'm selecting. 

It has worked fine up until the recent 2.5.0 release.

4) open andlytics and it will say ""account xxx is missing. If this happens repeatedly try moving Andlytics from SD card to internal storage""

First of all :: Great App!

But, I miss the inferences i could derive from Andlytics before it stopped working for me. I thought I should let you know about the same as there is a probability many others might be experiencing the same issue.

Error message i get: ""No published App Found""

Following is the information which may help analysing the issue:
I have about 78 Apps published on play store and spans across two pages on the developer console. Two of them are in suspended state and one unpublished.

My device: Samsung Galaxy S Plus (i9001)
Android Version: 2.3 Gingerbread

Andlytics version installed: 2.4.2

It would be great if could learn about a fix for this OR if you could fix the API and make me happy again. :-)

App description, changelog and last update date are now available in `AppDetails`. `Links` is linked to `AppDetails` by FK. `AppDetails` are linked to `AppInfo` by FK, but are lazily fetched. Call `AndlyticsDb.fetchAppDetails()` to fetch when needed. See `AndlyticsDb` for other related methods. 

Other ideas from #348:

> One thing I want to see via the app is which version is currently live, that would fit perfectly in this sort of screen. I would also say simply always have a link to the app on google play at the top, its so common that there is no need to let the user choose if they want it.

Then I realized that I look at a lot more than just the Play store: Amazon's web store stats, Flurry stats, Google+/Facebook pages dedicated to the app, and so on.

So, I added a new ""links"" feature for Andlytics. This feature allows you to add arbitrary URLs to list of links associated with an app. You can reach the links page by tapping the app's icon on the main screen.

This is my first contribution to Andlytics; please let me know if I should have handled this differently.

While I am somewhat proficient at Eclipse, I have not been able to successfully to import and build the Andlyics code.  It would be great to have a page on the wiki or part of the readme file of the project to give some guidance (for us less proficient developers).

I do not want to go through the numerous manners that I have attempted this, but below is one with the results.

Method #1:
-   Download zip from githiub
-   Unzip to temp directory
-   In Eclipse, File->Import->Android-Existing Android Code Into Workspace
-   Select temp directory as “Root Directory”
-   Select “Copy projects into workspace”
-   **\* Not sure if one should also keep the actionbarsherlock project checked (I did).  

The new “LoginActitity” project has hundreds of errors resolving the ABS class.  Below are some example of the build errors:

Description Resource    Path    Location    Type
The import com.actionbarsherlock cannot be resolved AccountSpecificPreferenceActivity.java  /LoginActivity/src/com/github/andlyticsproject  line 14 Java Problem
The import com.actionbarsherlock cannot be resolved AccountSpecificPreferenceActivity.java  /LoginActivity/src/com/github/andlyticsproject  line 13 Java Problem
The method onCreate(Bundle) of type AccountSpecificPreferenceActivity must override or implement a supertype method AccountSpecificPreferenceActivity.java  /LoginActivity/src/com/github/andlyticsproject  line 35 Java Problem
    /LoginActivity/src/com/github/andlyticsproject/console/v2   line 26 Java 

I assume that I need to tweak the project’s properties.  I already had ABS imported as a library for other projects, so I then added my ABS library to the LoginActicity Project.  That did clear all of the ABS build issues, but I am still left with 18 errors including examples below:

The method build() is undefined for the type NotificationCompat.Builder AccountManagerAuthenticator.java    /LoginActivity/src/com/github/andlyticsproject/console/v2   line 122    Java Problem
The method build() is undefined for the type NotificationCompat.Builder AccountManagerAuthenticator.java    /LoginActivity/src/com/github/andlyticsproject/console/v2   line 122    Java Problem

I am more than willing to write it up once I know how to get everything to build.

In my opinion the Line Charts seems off by 12 hours.
when creating the values for the chart the date is being set at midday causing the plot to be put right in the middle of the day. I feel that the plot should line up with the line the date is labelled on.

To give you an idea. This is how it currently looks (Taken on my phone using Play Store Version, so the data/scale of both screenshots are different)

To me it just feels better.
What I did to fix it was in `/chart/Chart.java` I changed a few things in the statsForApp for loop in buildLineChart(). First I changed the date to a Calender because the method setHours(0) from the type Date is deprecated and then used `calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0);` to tweak the date to midnight making the plot land on the line the date is lined up to.

I've made the quick change to my fork of dev for buildLineChart() only because I think the Bar Charts for ratings and downloads seem to look all right with the date in the middle of the bar.
You can see my change here. https://github.com/CrosseyeJack/andlytics/commit/9c9f26269f633bbe4c4301c8d06fc302f9fc70c0 (EDIT: Does help if I post a link to the change :-p) If you think its a good idea then I'll give it a bit more of a test and make sure it ok code then make a pull request. It was a quick code change during a coffee break (tbh I spent more time writing this and snapping the screenshots then making the change :-p) so I've not testing the code properly.

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,AdMob date range tweaks and idea for a future feature,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","First I'm new to github (Yeah I know :-p) so still finding my feet like where the add label buttons are :-p

I would love the option to be able to select more of the date ranges AdMob provide when checking my Ad Revenue.  I would love to have are ""Month To Date""

which provides stats about this current earning period. I would love to have a go at adding this myself and got part way but then I got distracted by something shiny and went chasing after that.

Another feature I would love but would have to pinned as a ""future enhancement"" is the option to reply to comments directly from the app. But its an option I've yet to get enabled on my own developer console to use it anyway and from what I here most other dev's are yet to get the option either so it is coding into the unknown until the option is more widely enabled.

Anyways, just my 2 ideas. I did drop an email to the one listed on the Play Store but was asked to pin them here so all the dev's can have a shot at adding them.

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Fetching data with PHP,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","Hi!

I've been really impressed by your app so far, and what it's able to do, and I thought that maybe you could give me some piece of advice.
If you can't, that's okay :)

I've been looking for a solution all over the internet, and you are quite my last hope to achieve this project.

I'm currently developping, for private use, a website which would allow my friends (or other people) to watch the statistics of the mobile applications which I developped, statistics which would be fetched from Itunes Connect, and Google Developper Console.

So far, I've managed to do interesting things for the Itunes part of the work (fetching data, getting it into a database... basic stuff you would say) because there are scripts and API existing, that I can tweak to fit my needs. But I can't figure how to gain access to the Developer Console's data.

Right now, I'm looking for guidelines so I could figure out how to get data from the Google Developer console, which seems quite not friendly for this special use.

I already tried to send POST requests (based on what I sniffed looking at the console) after authenticating in PHP via Oauth 2 process. I couldn't test my authentication because I didn't know what requests I should use. And since there isn't any API to allow me to communicate with Google for this developer console, I'm stuck.

I've read your information/TODO page about it, but it seems like the login part is still on the high level to do list... :( 

I don't know if you've made recent progress about all this stuff, but I'd be glad to have any further information, since you look quite documented on the subject.

Keep up the good work! :D

This makes it easy to pull fixes directly from ABS, but also has some issues: 
- cloning the project is now a bit harder: you have to remember to `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to actually get all the code
- the submodule is just a pointer to the remote commit, so if you update, you need to remember to push in order to update the pointer. This makes sure everyone is using the same ABS code.
- we can't really push changes to ABS remotely (like `lint.xml`, etc.), only make local changes (or I just haven't figured out how to do it properly)

(I have the Galaxy Note)
1. The new font size in the tables is much to large so that a cell exceed one line

100
%                       for exampel

The same for the Buttons - the German text needs 2 lines

Bewertunge
n

My opinion is that the text for buttons is not need anymore. The images are meaningfull enough and you get more screen space.
1.  The larger font in the chart is good.
2. A very usefull chart would be  installations per day. This is the important value and not the downloads for me. 
   Whats the currect success of new version of my app?
3. The  Install/Download ratio is important to.  
   But the chart shows an endless cummulation value. So you cannot judge the current state.
   The ratio of this values with a moving average over custom days would be nice. (Simple calculation)
   
    If you want to integrate it, ask me how to handle the    x / 0   values.
   
   I am Physicis a have some more idea for statistical analysis.
4. Advertising view -    a precision of 2 digits for fill rate is really not need     100.00   newline % you get on the Note
5. Advertising view - The ratio  Clicks / Impressions would be nice.
6. The 3 Monthchart is good. Maybe further time ranges   6 Month - or more simple a custom value 1 - 100 weeks
7. The moving of the time interval in the chart with the fingers would be nice.  
   Additional Zoom ?

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Error deleting AdMob account,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello:

I wanted to delete the AdMob information for one app so I can re-add the account (when restoring my apps with Titanium Backup, I get the error that says that AdMob login info has been lost, and doing this fixes it). However, when I click on the ""Remove AdMob"" menu option, Andlytics crashes.

I have tried this with a clean install and the same happens once I add an AdMob account, then try to remove it.

The report gets sent via ACRA, but I thought it would be nice to add some more info by creating an issue.

Here's the stacktrace:

Could it be related to the fact that most of my apps use multiple APKs and are not yet supported by the new Developer Console? However, all the info that Andlytics shows is still visible and usable in v2 (comments, ratings and downloads), it's just that I can't edit the listing.

Maybe I'm wrong and it has to do with encoding, or any other thing?

I can send you more details if you tell me how to do it.

My device info in case this matters: Samsung GT-I9300 with Android 4.2 (CyanogenMod 10.1 nightly)

--> Looking at the stack trace it seems to be a problem with the account credentials. So I guess we can just catch the exception and show a toast or something like that.

 I have a question about the Andlystics's bug.When I launch the app at the first time,it checked my Google account and I selected it.But the app crashed when I click the button to go to the next steps.
       Because I am a developer,so I collect some information that I think would be used to help you solve that problem.The attachment was I collected:a screen shot before it crashed and a error log file.
       Hope these information would help you make andlytics be better.

2) Reword the rest to mention certain keywords (I'm not that great at this sort of thing but maybe something like this)

First off, this is a great app! Thank you for creating it!

I have a small request, could you add a US dateformat option for the displays?

Makes sense imho, question is how to implement this. Thus I would like to discuss possible implementations first. We could add a general preference for this where users could choose from a list of format patterns.
Best thing would be if this could be done automatically based on the language set. But I do not know if these patterns are somehow connected to the language in general, so I don't know if it is possible to ask Android for the ""right"" pattern...

Any ideas input?

```

However, it is failing inside `GwtParser:getAppInfos` when trying to read the icon url. By the looks of it things have been moved around/shifted, unfortunately without a copy of what it used to look like, its hard to follow all of the logic. Put a breakpoint at line 565 to get to the problem part.

So for my first app getIndexStringValue(iconIndex) is called with 4509 which internally gets 7 from the indexList where instead it should now be 12. But I don't understand enough about how indexList is built. Looking at the raw json it is quite confusing, as not all of my apps follow the same pattern. And because each bit of info is based on the previous ones index, its all out. Updating the icon one doesn't really help though, as the version code is not where it is expected etc...

Please add an option to disable auto-refresh every time the app becomes visible. This is very annoying on slow connections.

This could be done quite easily with another general option so we do not auto-refresh and only refresh based on the refresh rate that has been configured. This also happens when you switch accounts via action bar.

Is is not obvious to do this? You think people import export stats so many times that you put the only necessary reffesh button so far from hands? Iam just bored of such a stupdness. Please fix!!!!

She has a point in my opinion. Refresh and +/-/% should be on the right side.

I through it was always like this, but aparently not. What is the nicest solution that we can implement so that when you click on the details for app number 5, view the details, then press back, the scroll position is maintained and you are still at app number 5?

For now a hack would be to send the packageName in the intent to main, and then in main, if packageName != null, scroll to packageName.

A better solution would be to possibly use onIntentRecieved for switching accounts.

Some point that we need to convey to users:
*Preferences have to be re-configured (some remain the same, but it is best to say you have to do all of them)
*New zipped import/export requires extra steps to import old versions

I guess the import/export change should be in the description for the next month or so. Preferences should be fine to just have a note in the change log.

> Changelog:
> *New account management
> *Split preferences into general and account specific (you will need to re-configure all your prefrences)
> *Improved notification options and new JB notifications
> *New zip based import/export to make it easier to share stats between devices
> *Added a toggle to hide AdMob for unconfigured apps
> *Lots of smaller UI changes and general improvements

Once we are happy we can then in the dev branch:
*Bump the version
*Add the changelog

Then merge into the master branch and tag it.

Right now it uses the default. Second of all, as JellyBean has well very nice notification options it would be great if these got used. We would like a graph or table with info (input on this is appreciated), and maybe a certain use for the actions?

I also took a look at the code around the notification, which is really disappointing imo (I don't think any of you wrote it, so don't feel offended). Notifications are still created the old way. This should be done as introduced in 3.0, through the builder. For this however I highly recommend https://github.com/JakeWharton/NotificationCompat2 as it goes back just as far as the NotificationCompat builder in the support library, but has support for JellyBean notifications.

I'd like input on this, I'm willing to do the actual implementation of it.

The currently used [progress bitmap](https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics/blob/master/actionbarsherlock/res/drawable-hdpi/abs__spinner_48_outer_holo.png) is 72x72, and for example the [refresh icon](https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/icon_refresh.png) is 48x48.

While thinking about this, it is also worth considering how we will work with multiple accounts in general to replace the current and not great implementation of logging in and out using the back button.

%/+- toggle is harder because I guess it should be constantly visible in the action bar which is OK, except quite a few devices are limited to 2 action items in portrait mode and the forced overflow menu counts as one. This can be fixed by using the default menu panel on < 3.0 (don't use .ForceOverflow style) except we will need to provide alternative icons for any item that could be displayed in eirther the aciton bar, or overflow menu. This is possible by using an internal class in ABS (although because it is internal it isn't officially supported) to detect if an item is on the action bar during onCreateOptionsMenu. I have used this in one of my apps and it worked very nicely. And if support is removed for it down the line, well we can deal with it then.

At the moment this isn't needed, but if we set Import/Export to be isRoom|withText, then it will be needed for them.

Thoughts?

Looking around the app, it uses mostly lowercase text, with some sentence case. In keeping with the general move towards the design standards, it would be nice to make it all consistant by updating the bits that should be sentense case (pretty much everything except X comments, X total downloads, X active installs etc...). Additionally, some strings could be changed, e.g. 'Import'/'Export'.

I've brought this up now, rather than waiting for the ABS work to finish because I thought that if it is decided that it should be changed, it should probably be done sooner rather than later to save on fixing the translations.

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Notifications for stat changes on first load?,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I noticed something when I had to reinstall the app on my phone.  During the first day you have the app, you don't get any notifications or stat changes.  Just a guess, but I'm assuming that it is tracking those changes based on the info from the previous day.  I would suggest that there be another check in there for first runs of the app.  It would check the info from the dev console the first time the app is run and store that just like it would a previous day's info.  That way stats and notifications operate properly the first day you have the app running.  I only noticed this because I happened to remember what the comment count was for one of my apps and I noticed that there was a new comment/rating that I didn't get notified about.

Along the same lines, what do you think about making some sort of visual cue of updated/new comments and ratings when you manually go into the app?  Say...the border around each app's info box would be thicker and would be a different color, like red or the blue highlight color....something.  That would clear either when you click on something in that app or when you move away from the app.  The benefit here would be, like I said, when you go into the app and it updates, sees that there is a new comment and/or rating change and gives you a clear representation of that.  Otherwise, as it is...unless you happen to know what the ratings/comments count were before you went into the app or you happened to see it change after it updates, you may not notice the updated info.  Basically, the only visual and audio cure of something new/updated is the notifications.

"
AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Multiple versions of Andlytics now?,"[Label(name=""question"")]","If you go to Google Play and search for Andlytics, you'll find a few versions now.  I even saw a blue version that looked oddly like some of the preview mockups in one of the threads here.  This was bound to happen since it went open source...but right now, it seems that they are all exactly the same.

I think that if this group wants to stand out from the rest, there needs to be clear organization.  There also needs to be a major change in the UI and function that will make this version stand out above the rest.  

Now I have pointed out a few UI flaws and I would like to reiterate some now.  First, the settings...  Honestly that has always bothered me...how they aren't in a menu and that they are lacking (especially with notifications).  Then the whole tile layout that is there now.  On a phone, it just isn't optimal or a good use of space.  I can see it as being great for both widgets and as an UI for tablets, but not phones.  Would be great to have a consolidated, well organized screen.  Put the settings into an actual settings screen.  A lot of what is there can be icon-ized to save space and if a user wants a more detailed view, rather than doing that slide expansion effect, save resources and it can be its own screen.  Just clear, concise info on the main screen.  Some have countered that observation by stating that they like having it all on screen like it is, but still...whether you click to slide open or click to view...you're still clicking.  It wouldn't save you any time.  Again here is my quick mockup to represent something like a concise list: www.spiderflystudios.com/files/andlyticslist.png

You'd get and see all of the same information, its just compacted to save space.  If I knew how to program for Android or if my dev had the time for another project other than our own, then we'd be doing it, but you guys already are...no need for yet another rendition of the app.  With that said, if someone here would like some design advice/help, just message me.  I believe in this project and am willing to donate my time to help.

P.S. - The app icon that shows up on Google Play doesn't match the icon you see on your device, its flipped.  Would also suggest a new, unique icon for the app to differentiate this version from the others.  Here is one I did...if you wanna use it, you're free to.  If you have a suggestion for something else, lemme know and I'll see what I can do, but I think that this one is enough like the original for users to recognize it, but different enough that they'll know it isn't the same.  :)

Enhance the UI...
- By continuing the trend of moving it over to the aOS 4+ UI standards.
- Move the settings to an actual settings menu area.
- Change the method of switching accounts to something more intuitive.  Right now if you are on the main screen viewing your list of apps, when you hit the back button it takes you to a list of the google accounts attached to the phone.  Why not add Andlytics as sync option and only those accounts in which you have Andlytics syncing turned on for will show up.  IN regards to hitting the back button and being taken to that screen...it just isn't intuitive and doesn't make sense.  It should exit the app like it does with every other app.  For account switching, something like how the gmail app does it would be nice.
- Get rid of the admob tab as for many devs it service no purpose other than wasting space.  Make it a plugin, an optional install for users.  Then more plugins could be made for those who use other ad services.....but not every dev puts ads in their apps.
- Make the main screen you go to more of a dashboard.  It would show the app icon for each app you have.  Clicking on it would take you to a screen that shows all that info.  Right now they all come off as more of a widget look and feel.  Which would be great for an actual widget.
- Give more notification options....like choosing the LED color...vibration...choosing a specific sound, etc.
- Either integrate Google Checkout info or make it a plugin as well.

Thats just some of what I would like and hope to see based on my usage and what I've heard or read others said about their experience with the app.

AndlyticsProject/andlytics,closed,Auto-update or auto-infer GWT data,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I have two ideas to resolve the GWT data change in a permanent or semi-permanent way:

Auto-update (semi-permanent): there's no need to relase a new APK when GWT data changes, all we need to update are a couple of String vars now defined as constants in DeveloperConsole.java. We could make them non constant and auto-update them pulling from a central Andlytics server every time they change. This would still require manual effort of developers to fix the strings but updates would be immediate for all users.

Auto-infer (permanent): those strings are actually written in the main console page so I think it should be possible to infer that from the html of that page.

This latter strategy would be implemented as this:
- save the GWT strings in preferences
- if something goes wrong infer the new strings and update preferences
- try again

the Xsrf tokens can be inferred by the userInfo object in https://play.google.com/apps/publish/Home

don't have a solution yet for GET_FULL_ASSET_INFO_FOR_USER_REQUEST, GET_ASSET_FOR_USER_COUNT_REQUEST, GET_USER_COMMENTS_REQUEST, GET_FEEDBACK_OVERVIEW that are probably build at runtime using javascript
