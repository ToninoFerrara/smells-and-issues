I don't really know if this is a bug in sGit or maybe an Android filesystem limitation, but files managed by git-annex are forcefully changed and committed with sGit.

1) Clone [git@gitlab.com:teresaejunior/git-annex-test.git](git@gitlab.com:teresaejunior/git-annex-test.git) (which has a `cat` binary managed by git-annex).
2) Create an empty file called test.

   Explanation for issues of type ""ValidFragment"":
   From the Fragment documentation:
   Every fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated
   when restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that
   subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these
   constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated;
   instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with setArguments(Bundle)
   and later retrieved by the Fragment with getArguments().

Can you tell me whether this error means that the host rejected the private key, or whether SGit has determined the key is invalid? Thanks.
