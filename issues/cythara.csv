tks."
gstraube/cythara,closed,Chromatic mode as standard mode,[],"In my experience in using this app, I have found that chromatic mode picks up my guitar strings (normal tuning) way better than Guitar mode and it also works better than Bass mode for basses.

So I would advice setting chromatic mode as default mode (at the top of the list). Chromatic is multi instrumental and works better (in my case at least. It is better than everything else I have used). Setting it as standard would prevent potential users from dismissing the app because it doesn't work on par with other tuners, and that would be a shame because it does."
gstraube/cythara,closed,Adding cello tuning.,[],"I have added the cello tuning, fixed some minor issues and updated the libs version."

gstraube/cythara,closed,Build fails because of Lint missing translations issue,[],"```
/home/vagrant/build/com.github.cythara/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml:2: Error: ""app_name"" is not translated in ""de-DE"" (German: Germany) [MissingTranslation]
    <string name=""app_name"">Cythara</string>
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type ""MissingTranslation"":
   If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared
   in one language should also be translated in all other languages.

   If the string should not be translated, you can add the attribute
   translatable=""false"" on the <string> element, or you can define all your
   non-translatable strings in a resource file called donottranslate.xml. Or,
   you can ignore the issue with a tools:ignore=""MissingTranslation""
   attribute.

   By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a
   subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You
   can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the
   environment variable ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS.

   You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language
   in your res/values/ folder by specifying tools:locale=""languageCode"" for
   the root <resources> element in your resource file. (The tools prefix
   refers to the namespace declaration http://schemas.android.com/tools.)

gstraube/cythara,closed,New Logo,[],Hello mate. I saw your project and I think you should change the logo. I can design new logo for your project. If you want please comment below
gstraube/cythara,closed,set frequency for reference A,[],"Hey,
I would love to see an open source guitar tuner, but I'm missing one feature.
I play guitar in a klezmer duo and we have our reference A at 443Hz. Would it be possible to have a setting to set the frequency of the reference A?"
gstraube/cythara,closed,Dark theme,[],"I often use this app at night, and would appreciate a dark theme. The light background is a bit harsh on my eyes."

woud it be possible to have the option to see the notes in romance language (C=do D=re E=mi, etc), especially for the chromatic tuner which is the most generic tuner?

gstraube/cythara,closed,Added violin tuning,[],I have tried to work out what to do to add violin tuning (copied BassTuning.java and modified)
gstraube/cythara,closed,apk from git won't install,[],"dunno if it's personal issue, or wider scale, but apk (https://github.com/gstraube/cythara/releases/download/v1.5/cythara.apk) won't install on my phone. it works if installed from f-droid (which i'd like to bypass since You provide .apk's on git)"
gstraube/cythara,closed,implement other tunings,[],"please implement other tunings. now we have ukulele, but even this instrument has a ton of unusual tunings. personally i'd also love to set a demanded note manually (this is good for instance for other string instruments, to practice pitch with wind instruments, or in general to tune anything that is not a guitar). custom set tunings would solve lack of all the tunings in the world :)"
gstraube/cythara,closed,doesn't pick the tune,[],im having problem to make it work right — it doesn't pick any other tune than G3 (for some reason). even string G is hardly picked up by this app. looks like it's half deaf.
gstraube/cythara,closed,screen turns off while tuning,[],Expected way is to keep display on.
gstraube/cythara,closed,Ukulele support,[],"Currently there's no foss tuner for Ukulele - it will be nice to have in your tuner, making it a Swiss knife for musicians. "

gstraube/cythara,closed,No visual feedback.,[],"Everything I see is a ""b"" and a #, a ruler from -30 to +30 and a green mic icon. Might be caused by my small screen since it's only 480p."
