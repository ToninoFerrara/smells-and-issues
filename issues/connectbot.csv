A new API allowing third-party apps to once again be able to write to the SD card was introduced in Lollipop (5.X).

Using this new API, when running on Android versions where it exists, will allow users to download large files directly to where they are more likely to fit, i.e., the SD card.  Ideally, the new functionality would be transparent: a user would simply specify a directory on the SD card as the download directory, and it would ""just work"".  As an example of how NOT to implement this feature, try using SFTP in the current-as-of-this-writing version of ES File Explorer app to copy a file to the SD card (on a Lollipop device).  It works, but the user interaction required to enable writing to the SD card seems a bit awkward.

vx/connectbot,open,all port forwards in list shown with a line through,[],"Hello, I am hoping for some responses to help me understand what is going on with port forwarding.

Android 4.04 ICS.

Fresh install of VX, set it all up and create some port forwards, connect to ssh server and all seems fine.  Disconnect and then reconnect a few times. Then for no apparent reason and in no apparent fixed time or action, on a subsequent connection the previously working port forwards end up with a line through them and any network traffic through them is prevented.

Message reported states '..perhaps using a port below 1024' or port in use.  Well neither of these things is applicable as far as I can tell.

The ssh server is on a linux box and enforces IPv4 (for various reasons), but I understand this should not be an issue. Perhaps there is a setting on VX/Android to force IPv4 on the client side.

If VX is cleared of its config and effectively started afresh, it works fine again, until the above happens once more.  Quite frustrating to have to keep clearing out settings.

I would be grateful if any one can share some ideas on what is going on and perhaps how to fix.

Thank you for any help on this 'issue'.

vx/connectbot,open,Security?  Marshmallow automatically backs up app data (by default),[],"There's an issue for [connectbot](https://github.com/connectbot/connectbot/issues/146) and I created one for [Redphone](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/issues/433) too, but this seems like a big deal and I didn't see an issue yet created here.  Basically, to slightly repeat the gist from the other issue....

Starting w/the Marshmallow preview, a wonderful new feature called [Auto Backup For Apps](https://developer.android.com/preview/backup/index.html) has been introduced:

> Automatic backups are enabled for all apps installed on devices running the Android M Preview.
> The automatic backup feature preserves the data your app creates on a user device by uploading it to the user’s Google Drive account and encrypting it. 
> Automatic backups occur every 24 hours, when the device is idle, charging, and connected to a Wi-Fi network. When these conditions are met, the Backup Manager service uploads all available backup data to the cloud. 

So... without any user intervention, up to 25 MB of local app data gets _automatically uploaded to the cloud_, then encrypted there.  This is an opt-_out_ feature, and the responsibility falls on the developer to say ""no"".  Instructions for opting out (set in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file) are offered in the link above.

For connectbot & vx, my concern is that private ssh keys held on the device will get sent to Google.

The solution is discussed further in those issues so I won't waste space repeating it here.

Cheers,
ft

vx/connectbot,open,Customize the answer-back string,[],"Currently when a terminal ENQ is sent from the host (Example: echo -en ""\005"") vx connectbot sends back the $TERM value, with no trailing CR or LF.

The correct string for a vt220 is technically an escape sequence like ""ESC[?62;1;2;6;7;8;9c"" where the different numbers describe different capabilities and options of the particular terminal (vs the terminal type). Sometimes the host software requires this.

Many terminals and emulators also let the user define what to send back for answerback, including a way to define special bytes like carriage return, so the user can specify a response like ""myterm-foo^M"" or ""mystring\013"" etc. Then on the host it's very easy for a ""read"" shell command to issue the ^E and read the response back. Sometimes the host environment depends on this.

vx/connectbot,open,Cannot disable ALT+Backspace mapping / USB keyboard passthrough,[],"I want to send ALT+Backspace to the remote terminal, but ConnectBot is remapping this to the Insert key before sending.  Likewise, I cannot send ALT+Up/Down/Left/Right.  I've selected ""Full hardware keyboard"" from the Custom Keymap settings, and I'm using the latest VX ConnectBot from the Play Store (1.7.1-29).

I have a full-size (105-key) USB keyboard with physical Insert/Home/etc. keys, so this remapping is not useful for me, especially as I normally use ALT+Backspace (backward-kill-word) quite regularly.  Even if I didn't have an Insert key, I'd still prefer to send ALT+Backspace.

Is it possible to provide a way of disabling these remapping features, either with an extra option or a new keymap -- say, ""Full hardware keyboard (passthrough)""?

My aim is to use ConnectBot with a tablet and a USB keyboard for remote console-based development, but since I can't make ConnectBot transparently pass keyboard input unchanged to the remote terminal, this is still a second-class approach at the moment.

vx/connectbot,open,encrypted keys should be offered for authentication too,[],"when connecting to a host that has no particular configuration, not only should in-memory keys be offered, but encrypted ones too. in terms of host configuration, this would be a new option in the ""Use pubkey authentication"" setting (""use all available keys""), but that setting would be much more rarely need changing at all (as the right key would be picked by the server anyway; currently, a key has to be either manually selected or pre-loaded all the time).

implementing this might require tracking the public parts of the encrypted keys in unencrypted form (if that is not already done) and exposes the list of private keys to the server -- but that is common with ssh (ssh on unix does it too, and after all, everyone can claim to have any fingerprint in the offering phase).

this would be especially useful with third party apps that use ssh (eg agit), as they don't necessarily have a dedicated configuration for the host, and thus always need the key to be decrypted manually before using it. (in that context, the bug report came up originally; see https://github.com/sheimi/SGit/issues/82).

I've used this to good effect connecting to some personal Tor hidden services with the help of Orbot. (socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 suffices for this).

I've needed to merge some of the jsocks upstream code in order to get this to work, and made a few changes to the trilead SSH code to make it use a SocksSocket instead of a plain socket, and to use SOCKS-based DNS resolution rather than local DNS.

This feature obviously requires a bit of cleanup before it's ready, but it's a start I think.

vx/connectbot,closed,Allow ConnectBot to use a SOCKS proxy to make connections,[],"I've been experimenting with Tor lately, and have turned one of my home machines into an .onion site, and have permitted SSH as a service. I can manage to connect to it using the OpenSSH client on desktop Linux by setting it up to use Tor as a SOCKS proxy, and while it's slow it's usable enough. However, I'd like to be able to do the same thing on Android, and while Orbot provides a SOCKS proxy on localhost:9050, how do I get ConnectBot to use it? The transparent proxying provided by Orbot doesn't work: Connectbot still tries to do DNS resolution of the .onion site which obviously won't work. I've tried a few other third-party proxifying apps like ProxyDroid and Shadowsocks but they don't seem to forward the DNS queries ConnectBot makes into the proxy, and so they don't work.

Besides my own personal experiments with Tor and Darknets, I imagine one can use it to do other neat things as well. Since ConnectBot can already function as a SOCKS _server_, I imagine that it might not be that hard to give it SOCKS client capability as well.

My keyboard has Finnish/Swedish layout where certain symbols like {, [, @ are behind the AltGr modifier key. AltGr works fine on most Android programs (e.g. Chrome, K-9 Mail, etc.), but with VX Connectbot it does not seem to always work. It appears that if the keyboard is turned off and then later repaired while Connectbot is running, it starts acting funny. If I restart Connectbot (which means I need to go to the system settings menu and kill it, since there is no ""exit"" in menus) it starts working when I select ""full hardware keyboard"" from the ""custom keyboard"" setting. OTOH when the Connectbot is in this broken state, the Ctrl key does not work properly if I don't select ""disabled"".

vx/connectbot,open,"XTerm ""alternative screen buffer"" not supported, makes some apps work less than ideal",[],"Some of (fullscreen) console UI applications need to save original screen contents and restore it later. This just best practice to which we, console UI users, got used. That's how less, vim, etc behave. But for some apps it's even more critical, like for Midnight Commander (http://www.midnight-commander.org/) this is even more important, as the whole forkflow depends on the ability to switch between interactive UI and underlying command line.

The way these features are implemented via remote terminal connection is to use ""alternative screen buffer"" of xterm - with it, there're 2 buffers associated with terminal, which preserve content when switched to another one. The relevant escape sequences are ""\E[?47h"" to switch to alt buffer and ""\E[?47l"" to switch back to main. For reference, XTerm control sequences docs are at http://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html .

Unfortunately, the sequences above are not implemented, so this bug is about implementing them.

vx/connectbot,closed,"first connection worked, now all fail",[],"connectbot was installed and working fine.  after installing vxconnectbot, the first connection worked, but now all fail, either connectbot or vxconnectbot.  it takes my password, i see ""Welcome to Ubuntu...Last login...."" but get no prompt.  i uninstalled both and reinstalled vxconnectbot, didn't help.  i suspect some problem derived from having installed both connectbot and vxconnectbot?  what can i do?  am i relegated to a factory reset?  anything else i can do?

vx/connectbot,closed,vxconnectbot can't forward any port (local),[],"Hi. I have VXconnectbot installed on an HTC Desire GSM. My remote SSH server is located behind a router, port 22 properly forwarded and all.

I have SSH access (password- and key-based) alright, but the local port forwards associated to my host entry can never be enabled. I tried with a Wi-Fi and 3G connection (to eliminated speed issues), same problem. I even tried from within the same LAN, still nothing. I can enable local port forwards with an ssh command through the standard Terminal Emulator and through the SSHtunnel app (they only support password-based logins, though). The ports I've tried forwarding (same for source and destination) are 9091, 49152, 8080, 9, 3389. No luck with any of them, they always return the same standard error ""Problem creating port forward..."". I couldn't find any solution online.

Looking through the source, I found that the LocalAcceptThread version using INetSocketAddress is used for enabling port forwards. Perhaps if it was changed to the LocalAcceptThread that's using a simple int for the port, forwards might not fail. Tell me what more info I can give you to troubleshoot the problem, as I like VxConnectBot a lot, and I'd hate to use an alternative.

Thanks!

vx/connectbot,closed,Vx connectbot on Transformer Prime TP201,[],"Please add support for hardware keyboard for TP201.  In fact Vx connectbot works fine with Hackers Keyboard, but Hackers Keyboard must be loaded before connectbot, connectbot must be started with hw keyboard reattached. When ssh connection is established then I connect keyboard. Then SHIFT, TAB, CTRL, arrows work as on any other Windows or Linux box, function keys can be used as SHIFT+number which is perfect. But if connectbot crashes (which happens often when I have multiple ssh connections opened) then this keyboard functionality is lost, and whole process must be repeated.
Adding Hackers Keyboard functionality in Vx connectbot would be the best, but it would be great if functionality of Hackers Keyboard would automatically be restored with reloading.

""I'm using Asus android pad TF101 with hardware keyboard. In normal time, I can type the !@#$%^&*() (shift+number keys) with no problem. But in a connectbot terminal, I just can't do that. Shift+1(or 2 3 4) gives me nothing but a beep, and shift+5 (or 6 7 8 9 0) gives me a ~. ""

vx/connectbot,closed,symbol encoding is always utf-8,[],"As a proud owner of the xperia mini pro, I really love your patch for connectbot, especially the control key and being able to manually select which symbols I want to use.

The only issue I have is with the character encoding for the symbols: I use connections in both utf-8 and iso8859-1 and the symbols are always echoed in utf-8. I don't know how easy this would be to implement (I believe the java String class has all it needs, but I am not familiar enough with android to submit a patch...), but it would be great if symbols that also exist in the terminal's encoding were output in this encoding.

vx/connectbot,closed,Xperia X10 mini pro support,[],"How hard would it be to add support for the X10 mini pro's hardware keyboard? I've got a rooted X10 mini pro and it seems like I can build the apk from this source, but I don't know if adding some mapping would require trail and error on the device to get the keycodes and then just put the X10 specific mapping in some java configuration resource? Where do I start with this issue?
