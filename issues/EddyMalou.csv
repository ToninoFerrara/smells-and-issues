F0x06/EddyMalou,open,"After playing multiple samples at once, no samples can be played.",[],"Hi. What an honour, first bug report on the Eddy Malou soundboard. Isn't free software great?

So, if you start mashing the app's sample buttons, the app will start playing all the pressed samples at the same time, which is a bit strange and leads to a cacophony of Eddy Malou, but why not. It's a free country.

However, any further samples won't play after that, until you quit the app and restart. And that's no good. I don't think the congolexicomatisation can in happen in this case (but I'm not sure).

Thanks for looking into this!
