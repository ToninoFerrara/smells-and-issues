tananaev/traccar-client-android,open,Implement functionality to capture a config-link and react on it,[],"It has been requested that an Android Traccar-client can be configured remotely, see #355.

@stefanb has had the idea of an Android App Link which carries config-data and opens the Traccar-client directly and shows/requests a new configuration, in order to free the user of bothering about settings.

My solution doesn't use an App Link, but it reacts on a deep link like ""https://www.example.org/config/?url=https://receiving.server.com/receive.php&id=12345&interval=120&accuracy=high"" if Traccar is installed (and not running). Otherwise the device opens the link in a browser and shows install directions.

Every distributing developer has to customize the intent-filter in AndroidManifest.xml to get a match for their config-link, or if not: no harm is done, the remote-configuring is never triggered.

Request for comments / corrections."
tananaev/traccar-client-android,open,"""High"" accuracy drains battery and never reports, ""medium"" accuracy too inaccurate",[],"For users of the Android client who are using it to track people with phones, obviously those phones spend a lot of time indoors. When indoors on high accuracy, Traccar's behavior seems to be to _only_ use GPS. It will keep GPS on seemingly the entire time it is indoors, never getting a fix. This will drain the battery very quickly as well as not provide useful location data. Medium accuracy is only really useful in populated areas where there is sufficient wifi coverage to give semi-accurate location. And even in heavily populated areas it is sometimes unreliable.

I see two possible fixes for this:
A. Have a timeout for a GPS fix. If it doesn't work, fall back to a ""medium"" fix until the next location update interval.
B: Rather than high/medium/low implying a type of fix... provide a desired accuracy. If I can get a 100 meter or better fix with wifi, no need to try with GPS. Wifi fixes consume less battery and it's probably worth trying them in most cases, falling back to GPS if you end up with a ""1.4 km"" radius.

I think it is undesired behavior to have to choose high (which will drain batteries indoors very quickly, won't provide any location info indoors) and medium (which will work pretty well indoors, but often knowingly provide 1 mile or more of inaccuracy).

I understand Traccar is leveraging another library for location data, but that that library is poorly maintained."

Currently in the android application you can simply set the frequency in which to report to the server, however for my use case (and I imagine others) So I thought about...

Implementing a feature so traccar could fetch/log its current location (and store it temporarily) then set the frequency in which to report to the server.

For example, in Android you can set location services to only use GPS, the app could then be set to log its location every 5 seconds (for example) and then send all events to the server every 10 minutes (for example).

I'm starting with your software and I really like it. In my opinion the client app is only minor for you and doesn't have enough features. I'm not android developer, but I would like to help with implementing features I need. Please see my scenario below.

I have old android phone with battery in a car. This phone is connected to a charger, which is charging only when an ignition is on (default state for 99 % of cars). I consider this as an advantage, because phone can't discharge car battery and GPS tracking can be available for several days when car is parked.

This can be used to battery saving feature and detection that car is ""in movement"". You can use short interval (seconds) while phone is charging (no worry about power consumption & car is probably moving) and long interval (hours) while phone is on battery (try to stay online as long as possible & car is probably parked).

I've added second interval to change frequency based on charging / battery status.
I'll probably add something like ""check distance and angle only while charging""

And now my question... Are you agree with this feature? Can I create pull request when done and tested?"

When movement begins, the request interval should be 1s until it figures out the rate of movement, and adapt GPS polling as expected.

I currently have 5 android phones of the same make running the traccar hidden app. On a reboot the devices do not appear to send location updates.

When checking the data and location services they are enabled, however although both enabled, only the 3g icon appears along the notifications bar and not the locations services icon. If for example I open google maps the location services symbol appears, however, when minimizing or closing google maps, the icon then disappears. 

If I then dial 8722227 it launches the traccar app. The app is running and configured as expected, at the point the app opens, the location services icon appears again in the notifications bar. If i minimize/close the app the location services icon then shows permanently unlike with google maps. At this point the app functions as expected and works perfectly.

It seems the issue for me (this may be specific to the phone I will try and do some testing), but on a reboot, the location services although enabled is not active, without opening the app. I have tried enabling disabling 3g/location services and this does not solve the issue.

When the app works again it sends the location update for that moment, but none of the old data, so it certainly seems the app is not able to access location data until it is opened.

Potentially I could advise when the location services icon is not present, open the app and this will fix the problem, however ideally I need the app hidden so this is not the best option for me.

Please can you advise if you have seen this specific issue before or if you can suggest a possible solution.

Many thanks for a great app.

tananaev/traccar-client-android,closed,Possible Bug? - Frequency value = 0 not able to set,[],"Hello Anton,

I have tried the new version of android client for android, Fresh install.

As per the release blog post, You have mentioned Frequency can be set to 0 if any of the other 2 values are set that is angle or distance, hence I have set distance to 300 and frequency I am trying to set to 0 however it just does not save as 0. it remains the same value that has been set previously, I can even set it as 1 but not 0.

Please advice, Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?"

To reduce the mobile traffic, an option ""distance"" would be great.
Only make a GET-Request to update the position, when the distance to the previous transferred position is greater than the distance given in the options.
Also this would prevent the car wandering around on the map, if it stands somewhere with bad gps-signal. (To a certain degree at least).
Setting distance to 0 als default won't change the behaviour to the current version.

As a fallback, you maybe want to consider to transfer the position every n seconds, no matter what distance is given.

As the cars that I want to track only travel short distances and are standing 95% of the time, this would greatly reduce the traffic.

Hope you understand what I am talking about - if not feel free to ask.

A while later I connected to wifi then Traccar auto-updated to version v3.8. Traccar is still hidden (no Traccar icon in the app list) and service is still running and updating to the server. In the app store the app registers as ""installed"" but only the ""Uninstall"" button shows up the ""Open"" button is missing. Also the 8722227 access code cannot open the app. In short auto-update breaks access to the Application.

Fixed it by Reinstalling the hidden version apk and disabling auto-updates.

p.s. Please advice people to disable auto-update for hidden release at the moment.

I noticed one thing, Not sure if it has been reported or already noticed.

Traccar client the latest version as well the previous had the issue, Where if a location is stored in buffer due to loss or non availability of data network.

These stored locations are not set together, but based on the set interval (thus I can see two scenarios)
1. Lag in data for near real-time tracking.
2. If and when the data connects back, the updates seem to be updated based on the frequency set, thus delaying the current location update until the buffered data finishes.

I haven't checked the code, I just noticed how it works and sharing.

I installed traccar in my iphone and basic android phone. I noticed that the location details provided by iphone is very accurate where as the information provided by android is not accurate. Also in android phone I noticed below:
1. When I choose the location provider as 'Mixed provider' and set frequency as 10 seconds, it sends location details only 3 times instead of 6. Any reason for this?
2. When kept in a moving vehicle, it does not always send the latest location details. It sends the same location details in few messages and after a 10 to 15 messages (sometimes even more), it will send the new location. So it is very difficult to track the exact route followed

Quick response on this is highly appreciated. Thank you.

Thank you for all of your wonderful work!

I'm currently managing 6 trackers running on android phones with that need to be fairly autonomous. At the moment I'm using Real Time Tracker 2. I'm using Llama to tell the app to stop tracking when power is removed, and to start tracking when the device is charging.

All I need to do that is an android app shortcut ""Start Tracking"" and ""Stop Tracking"". It's working beautifully.

It would be wonderful if traccar could have shortcuts as well.

In this way it would be easy to use apps like Tasker, Llama or Automate to make it even more useful.

Real Time Tracker 2 has shortcuts for

""Start Tracking""
""Stop Tracking""
""Track once""

If you could point me in the right direction I can even try to help with the code, although I'm not the best coder out there :)

tananaev/traccar-client-android,closed,Impossible to purge the DB,[],"Hi,
I found some annoying ""feature"". I don't know if the solution is in the server of the client: But:
Because the android client store the positions in a DB and tries to send them in FIFO and it does not consider then as sent if the server does not reply, if you run the traccar client with a certain device ID, without adding the client ID on the server (so the DB records the positions) and then change the ID of the client to something else and then add the ID on the server, the new positions never reach the server because the client is unable to send the old position with the old id.
Solution could be:
- truncate the DB when the ID change
- Make sure that the server returns something even if the ID is unknown. (currently the RequestManager.sendRequest() thown an IOException if the ID in unknown on the server.
  Because the catch only retrun false without any Log.e() , it was not obvious.
- use the HTTP error code returned by the server. Currently if there is a problem sending the position to the server, the user is not warned.

tananaev/traccar-client-android,open,Some remarks,[],"Hi,

I'm trying to implement a SMS request manager without messing too much with your code.
Currently the send() method of TrackingControlle is called each time a new position is available. If the sending fails, a postDelayed is used to retry 30s later. The successful update of the server with the position trigger the position deletion from the DB.
Would it be possible that you change a bit your code so that you don't remove the position from the DB as soon as it is sent ? (Like create a houskeeping job started every X hours to delete of positions)
It would be a good reason to start using the AlarmManager class. Even for the retry, contrary to the Alarmanager, the  postDelayed function of Handler is not started when CPU is in deep sleep.)
I need this because I need to send the X last position in a SMS if the last X position could not be sent by HTTP.

I could do it but I don't really want to mess with your code as it would make my fork un-maintainable.

More generally, can you try to make your code easier to interface with ? Like with the  PositionProvider abstract class that make it easy to create new providers.
I would understand if you don't want to modify too much your code because most of the forks created so far did not last very long. 
But maybe it was also because it is very hard to maintain a fork when the original project change and you were forced to modify it heavily for your fork.

It appears that points are now being pushed (via a GET request) to the endpoint, and being re-submitted unless the app receives a 200 response.  Of course, we're completely unprepared for this.

tananaev/traccar-client-android,closed,Latest Android Client,[],"Hi Anton,

I got a problem with the traccar clients on Android which was released June 20, 2013 (3 days ago).

The clients are 5 units of Samsung Galaxy Young, and 1 Samsung Nexus 5.

All were working for few months already. Then suddenly all of them stopped last June 21. As per checking, the phones automatically updated to the new version of Traccar Client. For some reason, all messages to the server are being dropped with the following logs:

2014-06-23 10:36:05  WARN: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host - java.io.IOException (null:-2)

2014-06-23 10:36:06  INFO: Closing connection by disconnect

I think the new client is not sending on the assigned port 5005 but I am not so sure. Nothing has been changed on the server side.

I have 2 installations of Traccar server. one in Philippines on our local server, and the other in windows azure. Both have stopped working so I am guessing this may have something to do with the new client.

I suspect I have a problem with correct port forwarding on my router.
I will describe step by step my settings:
1. I have installed traccar on my synology (during installation I've selected to open all ports) and forwarded ports on buffalo:

For externall access (from work) I use public IP and port 443 which is forwarded by router to local synology address 192.168.11.2 and port 7777:

http://my_public_IP:443  ->forwarder by router-> 192.168.11.2:7777

In this way I can open program at work.

I have forwarder also external port 55005 also to 192.168.11.2:7777

http://my_public_IP:55005  ->forwarder by router-> 192.168.11.2:7777
1. My android settings are:
   Server address: http://my_public_IP   (without port, only IP number)
   Server port: 443
   Location provider: mixed

I have still status:
Location updated
Connection failed

I have attached picture as well.
