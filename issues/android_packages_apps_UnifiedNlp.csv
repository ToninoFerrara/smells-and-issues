microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,open,Issues with unifiednlp location!!!  In android 9,[],"Hello devs  , 
I want to let u know that our unified nlp no longer works perfect , as it is having issues in Android 9 , its working like a charm in oreo and below , but in android 9 if we install the standalone application there are issue in registering and binding it into system , but whenwe install microg using installer like nanodroid , the it registers into system but always show plzz check ur location backends nmand unified nlp has no location to test geocoders! 

I have given all the permission to it , and even using terminal  too , as describes in issue
https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/366#issuecomment-427252345

So plz take a look into this and fix it if possible as many of the users are forced to be on oreo as there are compatibilty issue with pie!!

Also i have checked the same on 3 to 4 ROMs. 
And i the issue was same in all of them ! "

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,open,"Google Maps API was updated yesterday, some apps stopped working",[],"OK, so I have noticed that at least an application I used (which relies on Google Services, at least on the Google Maps API for location purposes) refuses to even start since two days ago with an error ""Google Services is needed to run this app"".  
 
This is coinciding with the Google Maps API being updated. Among other things this update introduces the need to have any request sent to the API propperly signed  with an API key and tied to a billing account. The deadline to start signing all the requests with a valid key was June 16th.

Now, we know that MicroG sings the petitions with a spoofed (or whatever, I don't know the details  tbh) but I doubt that the key tied to any active billing account, so the call gets rejected and the app doesn't start.

Find here the related documentation for this: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/

Also, the fact that some apps stopped working but others still do make me think that either I am horribly wrong about this or that it is dependent on how the app makes these calls or which services they are using (maybe the only ones failing right now are the ones using the [Premium API](https://developers.google.com/maps/premium/overview).

Anyway, leaving this here hoping it can be helpful. Please move it to the appropiate place if this is not the correct one."

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,open,Installation of UnifiedNlp GAPPS on FP Open OS loses backend activation after each reboot,[],"Here's a [description of my setup](https://forum.fairphone.com/t/a-guide-to-install-open-gapps-while-minimizing-google-dependency/40354/3) that follows on [M.A.K.'s instructions](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/unifiednlp-gapps-patch-t3567887).
FP Open framework has an org.microg.nlp line item, so patching isn't needed. Google location stops scanning with the deactivation of two services, what allows for UnifiedNlp to bind the backends, but backend boxes need to be cleared and rechecked after every reboot. UnifiedNlp is installed in priv-app and backends as user apps, moving backends to priv-app doesn't change anything.
This setup is the only one that allows for all Google Location dependent apps that I have to run, so I cannot change which services can be reactivated or deactivated without breaking it. It has shown to be pretty solid except for the clearing and rechecking of backend boxes after each reboot."

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,open,LocationProvider sometimes returning NaN,[],"Hi,

First of all, I'm not sure this is the right repo to post this issue. Please, let me know if it should belong to another repo and I'll fix it.

I'm using LineageOS with microg ROM on my Nexus 5, together with UnifiedNlp and Apple Wifi backend. I am also using [OwnTracks](http://owntracks.org/) (which relies on `FusedLocationProvider` as far as I know) to track my phone's position every 5 minutes and send the location to a remote server. My phone geolocation setting is always set to ""power saving"".

I noticed that from time to time, I receive a `NaN, NaN` location, which is directly coming from the `FusedLocationProvider` implementation, as far as I know. I'm not exactly sure what happens here, and I guess this might be actually a regular behavior of `FusedLocationProvider` (when it cannot acquire a location for instance). Still, apparently, from reading the official docs of this Google API, it should never return a `NaN` value.

This is not a really big deal in OwnTracks as it handles it quite fine, and simply implicitly converts it to zero and this can be filtered away afterwards on the server side. On the contrary, many apps I've encountered so far are not resilient to an unexpected `NaN` value here and simply crash.

Then eventually as maps were important to me I flashed the newest stable cm-9.1.0-smultron.zip onto the device. Here I got it to work, but felt that was mainly through using /system/app mover to move UnifiedNlp to be a system app. After reboot all or most of the boxes in UnifiedNlp were ticked and it worked wonderfully with either MozillaNlpBackend or LocalGsmNlpBackend (with the offline DB), the device finding itself quickly in OsmAnd~ and network/GPS locations in the small Here GPS Location app

A few weeks went by and I noticed that the stable CM-9 had no FM radio like 10 did. Realising I couldn't install one I thought that the network location mainly worked as I had made it into a system app and rebooted. So feeling adventurous, I went from 9 back up to CM-10 and now I've got the FM radio back but even with UnifiedNlp as a system app it will not work! Android-Version is 4.1.2 .

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,open,Long delays until position is acquired,[],"I noticed that UnifiedNLP has really long delays until a changed location is being reported. E.g. a weather widget might stay for several hours (some times more than 12h) on the same location until it notices a change in location. Especially annoying is that Tasker (the automation app) profiles based on network location (without GPS) are extremely unreliable: Tasker cell contexts, i.e. profiles based on the ID of the current cell tower, work perfectly, the same profile with UnifiedNLP and location context has a delay of 15+ minutes to hours. And that even if the phone is definitely logged into cell towers which should trigger the context.

I also can have Mozilla stumbler running in parallel. As this programm shows the current location as computed by Mozilla NLS, I see that the correct position is available, but UnifiedNLP does not report it until much later.

I use a Samsung S7 with different custom MM-ROMs, and MicroG-UnifiedNLP with different backends (Mozilla and OpenCellID). It somehow seems as if UnifiedNLP is kind of dozing and not updating its position info. Maybe some power saving mechanism of Android MM is interfering with the continuous work of UnifiedNLP, but I have not yet found a solution.

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,closed,Stale location reported when backend calls report(null),[],"This came out of an issue in the openBmap backend, https://github.com/wish7code/org.openbmap.unifiedNlpProvider/issues/13: After getting stale locations under some circumstances, I did some investigations and introduced some modifications into the backend.

The backend does a combined cell/wifi lookup, either online or using an offline DB (all my tests were done with the offline DB).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Fire up an appropriate app in an environment with known wifis. I used SatStat, available on F-Droid, which visualizes both GPS and network location along with their accuracies. Check location, then return to home screen making sure no other app requests location updates).
1. Move to a location with no known cells and wifis at all, and fire up the app again.

The first step behaved as I expected: the modified backend gave me a crisp (+/- 20 m) location. The second step was performed some 5 minutes after leaving the previous location. SatStat claimed I was still within 20 meters of the old location, even after I killed and restarted it (to rule out any caching in SatStat).

Analyzing the logcat, I find that I originally had 26 wifis in range, from which the backend calculated a location and reported it. In the metro station, the backend reported that no wifis were in range and the only visible cell was not in the DB. It reported a null location, <del>resulting in a call to `report()` with a `null` argument</del>. Then, however, UnifiedNLP (specifically NlpLocationBackendFuser) reports the same location it has given out 5 minutes before, with the same et=+15d21h34m50s905ms (which I suppose is the timestamp) and the same accuracy acc=20.

Are backends supposed to call `report(null)` when they are unable to determine the current location, or should they simply not call `report()` at all? This should probably be documented in the API README.

In any case, the fuser probably should not give out old locations unmodified: when processing any location, its accuracy should be penalized based on its age (if you're interested, I can provide a link to my branch of the openBmap backend for an example on how to fuse locations of different ages) and the resulting location should have a recent timestamp.

UnifiedNlp is not requesting permission automatically like it should. same applies to the backend apps made by you, like IchnaeaNlpBackend which crash after selected this backend and pressing ""ok""

i suppose it's called runtime permissions under 6.0
apps like org.fitchfamily.android.wifi_backend, however can request for permission at runtime

yes we can grant permission manually in app permission setting dialog
but chance are only after first installation but before it is used by system (hack or custom framework-res.apk/config.xml + reboot), i can grant permission in UnifiedNlp app permission setting page to avoid this issue

after reboot, since UnifiedNlp is used as system NLP, I can no longer grant permission because it looks like permission is already granted while it's not. (seems like 6.0 bug). can't even toggle it off

Can alternate NLP offer more than 3 power modes?

When I try to update, it informs me that the new versions is signed with a different key and must be deleted first. When I try to delete it, I get a de-installation error.

Is it misconfiguration at my phone?
Is it sloppy programming - and should app providers be blamed for that?
Or should / could UnifiedNlp be extended by a component which pretends ""I'm google play location services"" ?

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,closed,Germany - only Apple WiFi backend works,[],"Hi everybody,
great approach - I really appreciate it!

Installed ug UnifiedNlp via f-droid on a Huawei y300, slimkat 4.4.4. No trouble - and with the Apple WiFi backend I get instant location data.

But:
I couldnt make any other backend work. Are there insufficient data for Berlin, Germany? - Or how can I troubleshoot the backends? - No idea where I could find error messages.

On the ""Here GPS location"" app I get ""network not enabled"", allthough location services are switched on and are set to ""energy saving mode"".

Btw: 
Wouldnt it a good idea to split GSM and WiFi databases by country / continent - as map providers do? - And combine it with an option to load missing data online? - 400MB is not so little - and it's quite likely I'll not travel to US in the next few years...

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,closed,How to get the most out of UnifiedNlp,[],"Hi,
I have no basic understanding of software developement and computer science but after thorougly reading the README I got the UnifiedNlp to work perfectly on my Fairphone 1U (Fairphone OS 1.8.2 beta).
I just have a few questions:
1.) I have the GSM Location Backend, Personal Wifi Backend, GSMNetworkLocationProvider and Ichnea Backend installed for Geolocation. Does it make sense to have that many backends? For example the GSM Location Backend allready uses MLS, so the Ichnea Backend is probably redundant right? (To contribute to MLS I use Mozilla Stumbler)

2.) Other Backends like the AppleWifiNLPBackend have antifeatures on F-Droid. (""This app tracks and reports your activity."" ""This App promotes non-free Network Services."") Does it really send data to Apple?

3.) How does the Nomatim Backend work?

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,closed,How do I know it's running,[],"Hello,

I'm sorry, this is probably a noob question, but I would like to make sure unified nlp is doing something. How do I do this? I'm using GSMNetworkLocationProvider as backend on a Fairphone running Android 4.2.2. I have successfully installed the LegacyNetworkLocation.apk and have access to the shell. I can't find a frontend, however, that tells me: ""this is the position we acquired using the Network Location Provider"" and OsmAnd~ definitely isn't getting a fix any faster. I live in Brussels, so there is a fair amount of well known towers around. I'm still running the inviu opencellid to add some more.

Help would be greatly appreciated.

Best,

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,closed,Question: How to install UnifiedNlp on CM11 without gapps,[],"I'm running CM11 galaxysmtd without gapps and can't get NLP to work. I did install the NetworkLocation.apk (V1.0.1) into /system/priv-app and rebooted, cleared the dalvik cache via recovery and rebooted again. I installed GSMLocationBackend V0.0.1.4 via F-Droid. Location service is switched on in system settings and power saving mode is selected. 

Catlog shows a ProviderRequest and then a Request for POWER_LOW from net.osmand.plus traced by org.microg.nlp.location.LocationProviderV2:

Still osmand reports ""location not yet determined"" (or rather, something similar to that in German). 

Also, NLP Controller shows an empty window.

Any clue what I'm doing wrong?

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,closed,What's UnifiedNlp.apk for ?,[],"Hello,

  There's a UnifiedNlp.apk in the release, what is it for ? I don't see any mention of it in the README except in the Building section.

microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp,open,Provider Priority? ,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi, 
I do not know if this is already implemented and it is hard to test, so I just write my suggestion here. Ignore it if you wish. 
What I would like is to have some less accurate providers still be able to cancel more accurate ones if the data differs. 

I had the problem with the Google provider, that someone in the Netherlands used the same MAC as my router. 
Google would always place me in the Netherlands when I was at home and had no GPS signal. 
But I am in Austria and had GSM reception. 
There just is no way to be connected to an Austrian GPS network and be in the Netherlands. 

So in my opinion, while the exact location of the GSM provider is less accurate, at least the country is more accurate and it would be great to use this to filter wrong results. 
This wrong data can not only happen with cloned MAC but also when wifi aps are moved which is not uncommon today,

I've finally uploaded the code, https://github.com/rtreffer/LocalGSMLocationProvider

It ships a tower database in assets/towers.bcs.xz - this is a binary format (I'll add the readers / writers + tests as a seperate project). It does not need any network connection and should thus work world-wide, out-of-the-box.

Anything else is rather boring. There is an internal class that handles all the ""subsrcibe to GSM Network events"" voodoo and the interpolation is rather stupid (800m / towers) and most likely to optimistic ATM, but I got locations in the log....

The readme says ""add issues for more implementations"" :-)

Could you provide an example like the random location provider buildable as a standalone apk?
