plusonelabs/calendar-widget,open,In a day header show number of days from today,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Some users, including myself :-), are asking for the same feature: looking at a list of events we need to know quickly and reliably: how far are these events from today. 
I personally often find myself realizing that I don't remember, what day is today. And even if I know this  (not using this widget,  unfortunately,  because a date in the widget header is truncated, but this is another story...) I don't want to ""calculate"" the number of days: I just want to see it.

Regarding implementation, it's natural to (optionally) put this number at a left side of a day header.
Format: a signed number, e.g.:       -5   -0 (for past events) +0 (for current and future events)  +3

Of course, this can only be encountered when there are enough items there that they either just fill the entire height of the widget or that there is more of them and as such scrolling is necessary to see the last item.

with 1.9.2 a dynamic generated VC/VN was introduced:

With Android 6 (API level 23) the ability to grant runtime permission has been added. The good news is that even today, when running on Marshmallow, the widget degrades gracefully: Removing the calendar permission causes the widget simply to no display any information.

We could however adopt the Android 6 permission model and only request the calendar permission during runtime (calendar data refresh), thereby the Google Play Store would not ask the user to allow any permissions.

1. Implement a mock for a Calendar provider. This special Calendar provider will supply events to our tests thus allowing us to test different cases, related to calendar events and Settings of our widget.

```
context.getContentResolver().query(uri, getProjection(),

Once the base testing framework functionality works, we will add actual test cases one by one and fix a code. We will need to refactor and rethink something...
2. Replace actual Calendars with the mock we will use MockContentResolver ( see http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html#MockObjectClasses )
3. It is not clear yet, how we will collect test data for our tests. As practice shows, currently it is very difficult to reproduce a User's problem, see e.g. #188 
So maybe we will need to create special reporting feature for users, which will collect data, required to reproduce a problem.

As these things (""notions"") are not natural to Android calendars (including Google Calendar app), adding them only to a Widget will be a partial solution. So I decided that we may achieve the same results using simple Google/Android means: colors.
Any User may use colors as they wish, so this addition of (optional) specific treatment of event color may be very popular because it's universal. I guess Google designers thought similar, when they limited classification of items in Google Calendar, Keep etc. to several colors only (see e.g. https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/1248865?hl=en )

As a first step (and maybe, as the last also...) I propose to add this option:

Preference Screen: ""Past events"" (as a group of similar options, #122 - ""Events that ended in past X hours"", will be included here also)
One ""ListPreference"":
Title: ""Show past events with color""

2. It unconditionally hides Declined events, and this is even worse, because User may need to see them. E.g. ""Google calendar"" Android app has ""Hide declined events"" option, ""off"" by default. I.g. Google calendar shows Declined events, but Calendar-widget - not :-(

Previously I used Jorte Calendar application, which has such a feature: the app simply appends ""[C]"" to the event's subject to mark completed events. And the app is parsing the subject to determine its status, is able to show completed events differently (hide them or show greyed...).

I would like to add such a feature to this Calendar Widget, but I am not sure if the ""[C]"" in the subject is the best way to store the ""Completed"" status for events.

plusonelabs/calendar-widget,closed,Fixes #51 - all-day-events,[],"This patch should fix issue #51.
ssakasuma has already explained the problem in detail but has IMHO made a little fallacy.
It is correct that all-day events are stored with timezone UTC in the calendar database.
But from the calendar-widget-app's point of view the millis-field may not be recalculated/adopted, because this value is passed to the legacy calendar app (as explained out by mpost) and any modification would result in a change of the event's start / end dates.
The common construction of a joda-DateTime object by

``` java
new DateTime(calendarCursor.getLong(2))
```

 is also necessary for all-day events
because they represent a day in the local timezone and proper ordering is needed (all-day events are always the first events within a day).
Thus the resulting solution is damn smaller: no special handling for all-day events anymore.

when I click on a date ( not an event ) it always pops up the Samsung calendar app instead of a chooser of the installed calendar apps (where i can set which should open from now on).

It is a problem because I do not use the Samsung calendar app but an other. The bug appears only by clicking on the date, clicking on an event pops up a calendar app chooser as it should.

User comment: two widgets
"
plusonelabs/calendar-widget,closed,All day events are displayed one day to late,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","The issue is reported by several people via email and in the app comments.

Example:

""Good BUT... All my ""all day events"" show on the immediate previous date... ie: all day August 3rd shows under August 2nd. But Timed events show on the correct date... otherwise great design, just wish it worked... so not quite full JB or ICS calendar support yet...???""

Research has not revealed the problem. Maybe timezone related?
