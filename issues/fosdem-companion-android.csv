This small PR fixes the broken link to F-Droid :+1: "
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Adding Kotlin code in the repo,[],"Hey @cbeyls 
I checked the codebase and is only Java.

I wanted to convert some classes to Kotlin, are you ok with that?
Or are there any reason why this repo should be Java only? "
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,App crash when text is selected,[],"We noticed a rare bug. The app crashes when text is selected and one switches between talks with a swipe.

the bugreport [here](https://github.com/linuxtage/glt-companion/issues/8) includes a video. I was able to crash the app on Android 8.0.0 as well.

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Video download,[],"Now, that FOSDEM is over, I am downloading all the videos of the bookmarked talks that I missed.
It would be really awesome if you could download the videos right from FOSDEm companion - although I do not know if this is technically possible."
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Live - Later,[],"I don't know how feasible this is but maybe the ""Live"" view could have another subview besides ""Now"" and ""Next"" called ""Later"" that shows the talks that start after the ones that are shown in ""Next""?"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Show Room of Tracks,[],"Usually a single track is only in a single room. It would be great if the room was already shown in the ""Tracks"" overview an not only for the talks.

BTW: Thanks - great software!"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Room view,[],A way of listing talks occuring in a room. This is so that you can tell if you should stay in a room or not at the end of a talk.

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Share and show number of bookmarks,[],In order to have an idea of popular -and hence potentially full- talks it might be interesting to share and see the number of bookmarks currently placed on a talk 
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,allow for secondary bookmarks ,[],Sometimes I'd like to have lower priority bookmarks by example to keep a bookmark for later viewing or as a low priority alternative to an interesting talk. It would not show as a conflict by example.

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Display the speaker's bio and picture,[],"Not sure if the API you're using actually provides this information, but I would find it helpful to learn more about the speaker of a given session when tapping his name. Currently, you only show a list of sessions related to that speaker. Thanks!"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Notify when bookmarked tracks disappear,[],"As per subject, when a cancelled talk disappears from bookmarks, please notify me so I am aware of the schedule change. Since it's already bookmarked I think this shouldn't be too hard?
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Avoid having to scroll down again after returning to the previous screen,[],"Your app is truly a life-saver when trying to cope with the massive FOSDEM schedule, thank you for that.

However, there is one thing that somewhat annoys me and causes unnecessary confusion in my opinion: every time I step back one level of detail (e.g. returning to the list of sessions for a given track, or returning to the list of tracks), I end up on top of the list and have to scroll down again to where I was before.

Would it be possible to memorize the location of where the user was in the screen before, and return back to it instead of going to the very top again?

Thank you!"

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,nav.fosdem.org integration,[],"Hello cbeyls,

Mark here, FOSDEM staff. Really cool to see you have updated this one for FOSDEM 2017 too.

I wonder if you see a way to integrate or give some extra visibility to nav.fosdem.org. That is an on-campus routing app. Experimental for now, finishing touches, but we are rather certain it will be production ready by FOSDEM. It's basicly the FOSDEM campus data ported to the official 33c3 routing app.

One can do things like find the way to a specific stand or devroom in the app. In a future iteration, we might also be able to detect position based on ssids and similar stuff.

If you're interested, we can be reached at irc.freenode.net#fosdem-nav to speak about this in a less asynchronuous way. Kragniz is the person leading this effort.

Kind regards,

Mark"

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Added some buttons to download the app,[],
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Bullet points not rendered,[],"The talk abstract and description allow [some markup](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#list), e.g. bullet points. Some talks are using it, e.g. [this one](https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/flow/).

This markup (at least bullet points, that's what I noticed) is rendered correctly on the fosdem website. The app does not render them at all, and all lines are concatenated on a single line without spaces. It would be great if they were rendered correctly.

Except for this, a great app, thanks!"

"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,fixed time zone issue with summer time,[],"this change removes issues with times. Exports to the calendar would be one hour late during CEST. 

It's likely not to affect FOSDEM, but does affect events that are using the code base in a time zone with summer time during summer time, like [Grazer Linuxtage](https://github.com/linuxtage). 

there are no issues when the events are held during winter time, but during summer time (GMT+2) it becomes a problem. Setting the timezone to ""Europe/Brussels"" fixes this, as it auto adjusts summer and winter time.
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,"""Venue Location"" dialog added. #53",[],"Have added a custom dialog for the venue location.

mariobehling has requested a new venue location page but I thought to make custom dialog instead. The idea that led me create a dialog instead a page is that a page should be for an entity, not for an attribute. For example, an event is entity for this app which has various attributes and venue is one of them.

I couldn't find values of some details mentioned in the dialog, so I just put some random data over there which, ofcourse, can be easily changed.

"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Added live map and card UI in list items,[],"I have changed the current map image to a live Google Map using the Google Maps API v2. Since, the API key runs on my account, I have used my own SHA1 finger-print. The map will run if you only run the apk. But if you want to build it, you need to create your own API key using your system's SHA1 fingerprint.

Secondly, I have added Google Card UI in the list items in the ""list_tracks.xml"" file. It is more modern, consistent and nice looking interface.

Please merge my fork into the main repo.

Thank You.
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Added feature position on the map,[],"Hello,

Thank you for the awesome app.
I was still using the one from eMich because I liked it better when I tested the first (I believe) release of this one but after attending your presentation, I could see you have come a long way and you have really made it awesome.

Yet, I noticed the map was quite simple and I wanted to take on the challenge to add the user's position to it.
As you can see, I'm using a linear system which is wrong but the covered zone is small enough so that the error is negligible. Also, I had to recalculate the coordinates of the corners myself so it is possible (and very likely) that this is impacting the precision. Nevertheless, I was able to achieve good enough result in the emulator.

Finally, let me add that I would understand if you'd consider the map more useful as it is now. I mostly did it for the challenge.

Regards,
Benjamin.

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Improve Navigation on Bookmarks page,[],"Thanks for this helpful app and your talk about it in the Lightning Talks.
I think there was an unfortunate choice in the navigation on the Bookmarks page. When you decide that you want to uncheck a bookmarked session and then click the back button you are taken to the tracks list instead of the bookmarks list.
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Use geo URI in MapFragment.java,[],"Why not use a geo URI instead of a Google Maps link in [MapFragment.java](https://github.com/cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/be/digitalia/fosdem/fragments/MapFragment.java#L53)?

On my device the link is handled by OsmAnd (at least it is proposed in the list of applications when tapping the Directions button). I guess they intercept the `maps.google.com` link on their side, but that could not be the case for all navigation apps.
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Ability to view or export favorite talks as a timetable,[],"Thanks for this useful app!

Would be cool to have a timetable with the favorite talks, so that you have a better overview to make a choice between the overlapping talks and those you can attend.

Today I also used the Giggity app to solve this problem: import the schedule and remove all unwanted talks…
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Show clashes in bookmarks view,[],"I have bookmarked both Bron Gondwana's JMAP lightning talk and Daniel Lobato's Foreman talk. They are both at 11am on Sunday, but there's no indication in the app that they clash.

Many years ago someone contributed this feature to [my equivalent app for the N900](http://willthompson.co.uk/sojourner/) so maybe I should pay it forward …
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,open,Be able to see the new tracks added after database update,[],"Hi Christophe !

With the approach of the event, I started to look at which would be the tracks this year. I bookmarked a few ones and some days later when I returned on the app and updated the database, I had no idea which tracks were news or where there were. So it would be nice if some sort of special list was in place allowing us to see the added tracks (compared to the database state after last update).

For now, I have to return in every section of every day to check if I'm not missing something ... I think this can be improved, no ? It is something that can be easily develop ?

Thank you in advance, we I'll see at FOSDEM. ;)

cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,Add links to videos ,[],"Please add links to videos as they become available, even now after the event. 
"
cbeyls/fosdem-companion-android,closed,upcoming starred could show current events,[],"With a few session going over time, especially later on the day, it would be nice if the ""show upcoming only"" filter for the starred (and live) events would also show events that have a start time up to 5 minutes on the past.
E.g. the mailpile session was planned to start at 1700, but I got out of the prior session on DoudouLinux at 1700, and I had to remove the filter to see where the mailpile session was at.
