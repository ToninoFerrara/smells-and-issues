mjdenham/and-bible,open,ESV2011 section titles often displayed in wrong locations (offset by one verse),"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Prio: High"")]","Sorry if the title isn't quite clear. In AndBible 2.11.1.246, I've downloaded and am viewing the ESV2011 (ESV with Strongs numbers) module, and am finding that non-canonical section titles are often displayed in the wrong places, offset by one verse, if they are not at the beginning of a chapter.

For example, in Matthew 18, ""Who Is the Greatest?"" shows up correctly before verse 1, but ""Temptations to Sin"" is displayed before verse 6 instead of before 7, ""The Parable of the Lost Sheep"" is displayed before verse 9 instead of before verse 10, etc. This issue is reproducible on both my tablet (running Android 6) and my phone (running Android 7).

Notably, I do not see this issue arise with NET or ESV2001. However, if I view the same passage in ESV2011 in Xiphos or BibleTime on my Linux system, the titles are displayed in the expected and correct locations, so I strongly suspect the issue is with AndBible, not with the module itself."

### Reviewers: 
This pull request includes everything that is ready to be reviewed/tested (and perhaps merged) so far.

Phase 1 (verse by verse speaking)  
 - Old method is used for commentaries & genbooks
 - There are two speak windows: one for bible, one for others. Active window content determines which one is opened. 
 - Automatically pause/continue when headphone is disconnected/connected
 - Persist speech state if paused and going away from app
 - Bible book change message like this: ""Book changed. Exodus chapter 1.""
 - Optionally synchronize speech with first window
 - Speak chapter changes like this: ""Genesis Chapter 1."". Book name is spoken in the locale determined by bible translation.
 - Continue sentences: if verse does not end in period (or !, ?), opt to feed more content to TTS. This is to make sure speech intonation is correct.
 - Auto bookmark on pause / stop with special speak label. 
 - Speak speed adjustment
 - Increase speech rate maximum to 300% (closes #99)

Phase 2 (Add text options to TTS) 
 - Option to speak titles
 - Option to use earcons (page flip sound before title etc.) 
   - Earcon sources:
     - Page flipping sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k8XfsqkU3o
     - Others: KDE project (as of Ubuntu 16.04 in /usr/share/sound/*))
 - Option to have small delay between paragraph changes 
 - Option to replace divine name (LORD) with Yahweh while speaking

Phase 3 (Speak notifications)  
- Show notification while speaking / paused. Notification shows the latest title and current verse.
- Take wakelock while speaking to prevent from sleeping
- Use foreground service to prevent OOM killer from killing speaking process (notification can't be removed while speaking)
- Support notification channels (Oreo). Notification support down to Android L. 

Phase 4 (Widget) 
 - Add widget showing playback buttons, current title and bible verse

Phase 5 (Autobookmark) 
 - Option to save playback settings into bookmark & restore when resuming.
 - Improve and simplify speak settings layout

Phase 6 (Sleep timer) 
 - sleep timer option
 - add and improve tests
 - more widget types, especially TTS bookmark widget which has shortcut buttons to TTS bookmarks.

mContentView.setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION);

The only catch I can see is that this flag was introduced in Android 4.4 API, so if you are holding back and wanting to maintain compatibility with pre-KitKat APIs (which seems a little overly conservative), then you couldn't switch to using immersive mode.

1. Display date bookmark added in bookmark list. (Added TwoLine2TitleListItem for this)
2. Display translation abbreviation in the bookmark list and show the text from that translation. (E.g. KJV and T4T)
3. Let a long press on bookmark list (after a bookmark was selected) select all bookmarks from previous long press to current long press. Useful to quickly select many bookmark entries for delete or labeling.
4. Show add bookmark button also if bookmark exist already. If selected the bookmark's date will be updated to the current time.

I found the API AlarmManager.set() is used to schedule a restart the app in one second in [MenuCommandHandler.java](https://github.com/mjdenham/and-bible/blob/5d6b0e3bd4c578ff2cfec9979e7e82deaa401acd/and-bible/app/src/main/java/net/bible/android/view/activity/page/MenuCommandHandler.java#L172).
FYI, the behaviour of this API has changed since API 19 (KitKat) according to the [API guide](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#set(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)). After KitKat, the alarm may not be triggered at the exact time but may be delayed by the system.

To guarantee a intended quick restart, I think using [AlarmManager.setExact()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setExact(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) will be a better choice.

1. allow the new speed control to go higher (by expanding the range to the same range Google TTS allows),

This is a commonly reported error with no apparent side affects which I just caught because I could not reproduce it.   However, I have finally reproduced it.  The error is caused by a prior ClosedByInterruptException during FileChannel.transferFrom when moving the downloaded font.properties file.  However it seems unrelated to the font.properties download.  I suspect that when any error occurs fetching a repo's book list Android then attempts to interrupt the thread and the first interruptible command is transferFrom.

I have attempted the simple fix of replacing transferFrom with a simple file copy loop.

mjdenham/and-bible,open,"Arabic RTL, headings not properly displayed","[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Dear guys, thanks for fantastic work

In Arabic:  chapter headings are sometimes in the wrong chapter -- so where Galatians chapter 2 has its title at the top;  in Arabic, the same title comes just before the bottom of chapter 1.  This is happens in Galatians chapters 1-5, and in other books.  And only happens when a heading would begin a chapter.  This kind of thing is very common in texts that mix ltr and rtl.  And so is possibly a little related to bug #59???

Also in Arabic:  words are often raised or lowered a little from their baseline.  Sometimes to the extent of overlapping other lines a little.  For instance Galatians 6.8-10.  I don't know why this might happen.  It seems to be more common with the phrase 'Christ Jesus'

The font choice for Arabic though is good and clear to read

I really like Ivona Voice - not sure if other Text to Voice systems have the same problem.

""LORD's"". (example Gen 44.8 works fine; Lev 2.3 is bad) This is pronounced ""Lord Ez"". I assume this is because of the change to show the name of the Lord in Small Caps. So the voice software disconnects the letters 'Lord' from the letters apostrophe and 'S'. 

""Selah"". (example: ESV Psalm 3.2) This is pronounced correctly but ironically there is NO pause at all after it. Selah is suppose to mean pause and think about what has been said. However because there is no fullstop after 'selah' in the ESV version on AndBible it merges 'selah' with the first word of the next sentence.

Possible solution: I would think that all that is required is to send the text to a parse function (I suspect that is already happening) that would make some slight adjustments to the text. For example, it would change the unconventional capitalization to normal capitalization. And it would add a full-stop or even better a long pause after 'selah' if it didn't have one.

I have been finding the Speak option in AndBible excellent. Ivona voice is good enough for me to forget that it is a computer speaking. I use the Aussie voice. Highly recommend it.
