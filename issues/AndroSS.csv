tstein/AndroSS,closed,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.util.Base64: byte[] decode(java.lang.String,int)>:[8,25]
<android.util.Base64: byte[] decode(byte[],int)>:[8,25]
<android.util.Base64: byte[] encode(byte[],int,int,int)>:[8,25]
<android.util.Base64: byte[] encode(byte[],int)>:[8,25]
<android.util.Base64: byte[] decode(byte[],int,int,int)>:[8,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

NONE

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the projectâ€™s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report.

tstein/AndroSS,closed,Doesn't work,[],"I have samsung Galaxy TAB4 10.1 and cyanogenmod. I gave the program root permissions.
It doesn't do screenshots when I hold powerbutton and volume_down. Also I tryed to shake, but it doesn't work too.
When I hold powerbutton and volume_down or shake, there is nothing in logcat. Maybe my device doesn't react on such things.

Could you make a button in the program to take a screenshot after delay of some seconds?

I get contradictory errors. When Enable is checked, a popup appears saying AndroSS failed to initialize, then followed, intermittently, by another popup indicating su access has been granted.

I imagine it's possible that not all hardware requires the same sensitivity.  More a feature request than a bug.

tstein/AndroSS,open,"Enable screenshot by ""long press on search button"" or ""notification area""",[],"Hello,

I do not have a hardware camera button on my HTC Desire HD, and I don't like shaking the phone.

Would it be possible to add the following feature please :
- Allow screenshot by long press on search button (I disabled Google Search so this button is useless for the moment) which would be the best method ?
- or also with an icon in top bar after enabling service and menu in notification area ?

Thanks !

tstein/AndroSS,open,AndroSS compatible with HTC Desire HD ?,[],"Hello,

I discovered yesterday AndroSS in the f-droid repositery and tried it, great opensource app.

Installation OK, I've a HTC DEsire HD rooted with custom ROM CyanogenMod 9 beta.

According Google Play, ANdroSS is not compatible with my phone, but a comment left on February told it worked on a DHD.

So I managed to get it from f-droid, but each time I try to make a screenshot by shaking after enabling the service, my phone crashes and restarts automatically.

If I can help with log or debug to find the problem, please ask me.

tstein/AndroSS,open,Tinted screenshots,[],"Since this is a known issue and included in the description on <s>Market</s> Google Play (<em>rolls eyes</em>), I thought I'd create a tracking issue so people who run across this problem can let you know what they're running in a central spot.

I'll start. I'm running the stock 2.2.2 firmware on a Motorola Triumph (MOTWX435KT), and my screenshots have been coming out tinted red. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/2i7VW.png"">Very red</a>, as in my green battery icon is magenta. It looks like there's little to no blue coming through, judging from the color of the Facebook app logo.

You already know that AndroSS works great on the LG Optimus V (VM670).

I just installed AndroSS, and it crashes when taking a snapshot (with shaking the phone) with toast and vibrate notification. But it does not crash with toast only.
