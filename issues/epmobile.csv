see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3781151/java-lang-classnotfoundexception-on-working-app

We have a couple of projects where this issue was logged from time to time on the Android Market. I found the following issues in the manifests:

```
If the package name is com.test then activities names should be .ActivityName (with a leading dot), not just ActivityName.

For some classes, those that appeared in the logs most often, the class name was specified as com.test.Name while it should have been .Name.
```

I guess many implementations of android handle these minor issues successfully (this is why the exception never happened in testing), while others few are throwing the exception.

Good catch. I also had problems with the name attribute of application, where most devices worked just fine with ""MyApplicationSubclass"", but some would crash on launch. Changing to ""my.package.MyApplicationSubclass"" fixed the issue. Some versions/vendors are more tolerant to others on these issues. – nobre Aug 30 '12 at 18:54

mannd/epmobile,closed,Warfarin stack overflow,[],"A single warfarin module stack overflow error in reported on the Android developer's page.  Here is part of error report:
java.lang.StackOverflowError
at org.epstudios.epmobile.DoseCalculator.allHalfTablets(DoseCalculator.java:102)
at org.epstudios.epmobile.DoseCalculator.tryDoses(DoseCalculator.java:70)

at org.epstudios.epmobile.DoseCalculator.tryDoses(DoseCalculator.java:79)
at org.epstudios.epmobile.DoseCalculator.tryDoses(DoseCalculator.java:79)
etc.

This can be reproduced with the following:
INR = 5, weekly dose = 35 tablet size = 7.5

Here is the problem:  we are never getting to day 6,  because of this

```
       if (nextDay >= NUM_DAYS - 1)
            nextDay = 0;
```

Therefore we can get stuck because we never get to all half doses, day 6 is stuck at 1.0 tab.  So the loop never ends.

Additional changes:

tryDoses method returns void
don't need to zero array if allHalfTabs or allDoubleTabs
allow zero tabs by:  (iOS version)
            if (value > 0.0)    // ok to allow zero tabs
                [doses insertObject:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:(value - 0.5)] atIndex:orderedDays[nextDay]];
