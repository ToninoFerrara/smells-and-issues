yourealwaysbe/teacup,open,[FR] support more widget types,[],If the app/widget is going to develop it's worth thinking on adding new types of widgets. Some players devs don't pay attention to their widget's usability aspects. This is where TeaCup come in.

yourealwaysbe/teacup,open,Please fix album art filenames to be compatible with android stock music player,[],"If I choose ""Cache Last FM album art"" and ""Cache in music file directory"", teacup will save .png files in each music directory, the file name being the album title. This works ok for the teacup widget, but it won't work for the android stock music player: it seems this requires album art files named ""AlbumArt.jpg"" or ""folder.jpg"".

Indeed if I rename one of the files created by teacup into ""AlbumArt.jpg"", the stock music player will display the album art correctly (even if it's a .png file actually).

Please add an option to have album art files automatically named ""AlbumArt.jpg"" (or maybe this should be the automatic behaviour when the user chooses ""Cache in music file directory"").

(tested on Android 4.2.2)

yourealwaysbe/teacup,open,No longer scrobbling,[],"The app used to scrobble fine, but no longer does. When I try to test authentication, it tells me it failed. The credentials are definitely correct (tried re-entering them several times, after confirming them by logging in with a browser). I'm not sure why it's failing as the error is pretty vague, and I'm unable to mess around with it myself. Any ideas?
