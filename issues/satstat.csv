Satstat shows a blue or red bar depending on whether the particular satellite is used in the solution.   Another important thing is whether the ephemeris is current.   I suggest showing a hollow bar to show no ephemeris.  Really, I suggest hollow to show not used, solid for used, and red for no ephemeris, blue for ephemeris, but that's a bigger change.  The point is to match what Garmin units do, but there I think tracking and ephemeris leads to use.

A curiousity is that gpstest shows that GLONASS satellites are sometimes/often used with almanac but without ephemeris.  This seems odd, as I would expect the position computed from almanac to be so high uncertainty as not to be useful."

This app is one of the best ways to debug problems with other apps that use GPS, and to ""pre-search"" for satellites for other apps that are going to need them.

My UI idea for this…

* Put a button with an ""hourglass"" or ""lock"" icon on the main satellite screen
* Tapping it will lead to a popup window with time options (e.g. 1,5,10 minutes, Until Manually Disabled).
* Once activated, SatStat would continue searching for satellites even in the background, for the specified period of time.

The reason I suggest this UI is to avoid inadvertently draining the battery by keeping GPS on. (Probably the reason SatStat stops searching when in the background in its current behavior!)

2.) I would like to use a smaller regional or special map that -I download manually to the maps folder

Unfortunately SatStat seems not to recognize maps that are manually downloaded in that folder. Perhaps it's just an issue to register those maps?

From experimenting, that seems true for the internal GPS receiver, but someone on the OsmAnd list reports that an external bluetooth GPSr --  hooked up somehow -- results in SatStat showing a value that seems more likely to be orthometric height.

Unfortunately the Android API is misnamed; altitude almost never means ellipsoidal height.  It's hard to think of a better word that won't mislead or confuse.  My two suggestions are ""Ellips. Hght""  (Or ""Ell. H"" if that is what fits) and ""HAE"".

Just now I added DejaVu, and have been watching the map view with satstat.  All has seemed sensible.  I updated the mapsforge file from June of 2016 to recent today, and drove for about 45 minutes with that new file and DejaVu with no issues.  Then, I updated the radiocells/openbmap database to the currently-available us.sqlite, which is nearly 1 GB, compared to under 200 MB from before (yes, somethhng seems amiss)., and disabled DejaVu and enabled the openbmap backend.   I was seeing mostly-reasonable data, but found that satstat would crash every few minutes.

I'll have him check the sensors page (cf https://github.com/mvglasow/satstat/issues/37), and have a look at the logcat too."

I live in the south and west part of our planet. When using SatStat´s show of GPS data in degree/minute/second format in my tiny smartphone, the seconds of degree of latitude simply don´t appear.
I see something like:
Latitude:   Longitude:
-22°-53'   -50°-25'-33,6""
While seeing -22º53'35,0"" and -50º25'33,6"" would be better.
In a larger smpartphone all the excessive minus signals appeared, but I had the seconds of degree because the font size used allowed all data have space in the screen.
Can you remove excessive minus signals please?

mvglasow/satstat,open,Inefficient API is used in SatStat,"[Label(name=""awaiting feedback"")]","Dear developers,

I found an inefficient API, setImageResource(), is widely used in SatStat.

For setImageResource(), Google says this:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html#setImageResource(int)
"" This does Bitmap reading and decoding on the UI thread, which can cause a latency hiccup. If that's a concern, consider using setImageDrawable(android.graphics.drawable.Drawable) or setImageBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap) and BitmapFactory instead. ""

I noticed that in the following code, setImageResource() is used:
com.vonglasow.michael.satstat.ui.RadioSectionFragment.java   (line number: 213, 215, 217, 219, 221, 223)
https://github.com/mvglasow/satstat/blob/master/src/com/vonglasow/michael/satstat/ui/RadioSectionFragment.java 

Do you think the use of setImageResource() will affect SatStat's performance? If so, maybe we should move Bitmap reading and decoding to a background thread.

Thanks.

I really like SatStats map download dialog, so I've included it in the Radiobeacon alpha release.
Thanks for sharing!

@ReyhanJB recently reported an issue, where app crashes, when trying to download map while phone is in flight mode. SatStat (latest F-Droid release) also seems to be affected.

Nevertheless for RadioBeacon this is fixed by a simple null check, which might also be necessary for SatStat to fix the issue, see https://github.com/openbmap/radiocells-scanner-android/commit/47d2c706b62fcaadb22cb09420af63abdbc53f90

Are they really not used by the device? I think they are and just the status is shown incorrectly. As far as I can tell this started when I upgraded to Android 7.

This article (unfortunately in German) seems to describe the issue:
http://www.android-hilfe.de/thema/glonass-gps-probleme.795008/

If I understand right, the GPS API of older Android versions did not officially return a ""used in fix"" info. Since Android 7 this is officially supported, but a new API has to be used for this, probably android.location.GnssStatus .

I used git-bisect to find which commit introduced the bug and I found out it was this one https://github.com/mvglasow/satstat/commit/0cddd4a9a0b318f702d5f4dededf9f0c022a6740. Then I played with the code and I found which line caused the crash and it was this one https://github.com/mvglasow/satstat/blob/0cddd4a9a0b318f702d5f4dededf9f0c022a6740/res/xml/preferences.xml#L8. When I swap lines 7 and 8 the application no longer crashes and it can be used as a workaround. ""ListPreference"" can't be the last item in a ""PreferenceCategory"" for some unknown reason.
Tested with SDK versions 14, 17 and 23. The application doesn't crash when using version 23.

Ideas:
- On phones there isn't enough room, so if all cells reported have the same mcc/mnc, put mcc/mnc after the ""GSM"" and omit those columns.  Then add both representations.
- Add a line with the other form for the current cell (only).
- have a short tap on the cell table (or in that CID column) change the preference.

Once you rotate the device upside-down, the north heading is inverted on the compass (in a bad way). Also near the maximum roll, it behaves weirdly.

mvglasow/satstat,open,"Showing almanac, ephemeris and other sat data – please discuss","[Label(name=""awaiting feedback""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This ticket came out of merge request #48, which already got some input.

Currently, the sky plot and SNR graph use two different colors to show whether or not a satellite is used in the current fix; signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is represented by dot diameter/bar length. The SNR chart additionally shows which GNSS each satellite belongs to (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, others) – though this is going to be improved, see #64.

The merge request proposes to also implement visualization of almanac and ephemeris availability. In total, each satellite has five ""dimensions"" which could be of interest:
- whether the satellite is used in the current fix (currently represented by color)
- Signal-to-noise ratio (currently represented by size)
- GNSS system (currently represented by position in SNR chart, possibly by shape in sky plot)
- almanac availability
- ephemeris availability

Availability of augmentation systems (SBAS) has also been suggested, but I'd have to look into how this is implemented: is that a per-satellite flag, a per-GNSS flag or a global one? These systems present themselves as additional satellites (see https://github.com/mvglasow/satstat/wiki/NMEA-IDs#sbas), which should already be visible.

I'm looking for ideas how to best represent all of these. Some devices report bogus data (e.g. a satellite is used in the fix despite having no almanac or ephemeris), which also need to be visualized. Therefore, we really have to treat these five dimensions independently.

We may need to limit ourselves to showing certain dimensions only in one of the two graphs.

As for visual dimensions, apart from size, color and position, we could also consider shape (circle, square, triangle...), luminance and saturation, as well as border color, or maybe hollow vs. filled dots.

We'd have to watch out for ""interference"" between dimensions: fill/border distinctions as well as different shapes get hard to distinguish at small sizes (weak signal or lots of sats in the SNR chart); using luminance and saturation together might result in very similar colors.

Suggestions are welcome!

However, when starting SatStat (and location updates are being requested from GPS), the SUPL requests are clearly visible in the trace.

Apparently the GPS driver stack ignores the extra location provider command.

Tested on a Nexus S running Cyanogenmod 11. YMMV on other devices.

There is no easy way to fix on-demand AGPS download (this would require forcing all apps that are currently registered with GPS to unregister and re-register, which is not possible). However, the command can only be invoked from the main SatStat activity, and bringing it up will request location updates and thus trigger an AGPS update, so it is less of an issue here.

It is an issue for scheduled AGPS updates (e.g. when a data connection becomes available). Here it can be mitigated by registering for GPS location updates and immediately unregistering again. This will trigger an AGPS update if the GPS is not in use at that time.

satstat reads out the magnetic field so maybe it's possible to add compass calibration.
In former android versions was this possibility, but it's gone (since 4.0 I believe).
If one use magnetic compass, one have to calibrate from time to time (because sometimes they are going mad). This would be an additional nice enhancement of satstat.

first thanks for satstat and your work. I use it on an Nexus 7 2012 with cyanogenmod 10.1 and 10.2 since a while. Now I installed it on my Galaxy S4 mini.

It would be nice if satstat could reload AGPS data automatically when WiFi goes online or every few hours.

The satstat should have all required features, only an automatic trigger and checkbox to enable the feature need to be added.

Since wifi polution is getting bigger and bigger, and I already have had several wifi's on wrong channels, because there were already other wifis. Is it possible that you show the channel in your wifi section and maybe even channels ""seen in the last 1 minute"" so if you walk through your apartment from room to room you could figure out which frequencies are heavily in use?

Kind regards and keep the excellent work coming!

Regards,
Wompy
