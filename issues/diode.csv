In this scenario is the EXTRA_SUBJECT fields is a blank string (as opposed to null value), I assume that the sending app meant to do that.

If there is no valid URL in EXTRA_TEXT, then it will use the old logic. If either field does not have data (null value as opposed to blank string), then it will use the old logic.

I've tested the new functionality, but I couldn't actually find a test case with the URL and the description in the EXTRA_TEXT field. I'm willing to regression test that part if you know how to replicate it.

zagaberoo/diode,closed,Fix JSON parse on Samsung devices running 4.3.,[],"This is a one-liner, but I've walking around with the fix on my Verizon Galaxy S3 running 4.3 for the past couple days.

After digging through some Jackson code, I found out what's happening. It is true that when you mark a field `transient`, it won't get (de)serialized. However, it appears that Jackson conforms to the JavaBean spec in that if there's a public getter or setting, it considers that a bean property. In the case of ThingInfo, Jackson was trying to deserialize `thumbnailBitmap` because of the public setter.

In actuality, it looks like it tries to deserialize other similar fields (`thumbnailResource`), for example, but since those fail, it fails quietly. It only just now occurred to me that it might be because `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` is set to `false`, but I'm not going to go back and verify that just yet.

Why did this start happening and Samsung devices running newer versions of Android? My best guess is that Samsung created a new version of `android.graphics.Bitmap` that has the bean property `imagePath` on it, and that confuses Jackson. That's my best guess. Samsung has messed up other parts of the API before; `ListView` for example.

Everything here might be total bullshit, but I do know that this patch has allowed me to use Diode.

Finally, I bet you could get a performance bump by adding `@JsonIgnore` to all setter functions backed by transient class members.

If happens when the main browser on the device has lots and lots of bookmarks and history.

On my tablet Asus TF201, I have synced it up with my Google account. And due to that all my chrome bookmarks are synced with the tablet. They are around 4000 bookmarks.

The slowness happens in the call DownloadThreadsTask class.

This code causes slowness:

```
-           // Go through the children and get the ThingInfos
-           for (ThingListing tiContainer : data.getChildren()) {
-               // Only add entries that are threads. kind=""t3""

**Common.isClicked(mContext, ti.getUrl())** is used to query Content Resolver to check against browser's history and bookmarks if the url was already visited or not.

If I comment that out the performance improves **exponentially**. But ofcourse then I am not able to see indication if the reddit link was visited previously or not.

I don't know yet what the solution would be. Lets discuss.

One suggestion I would like to float is this: How about we maintain a temporary cache of urls visited from within App for about last 72 hours? And we check against the cache if the url was visited or not. Local cache would be fast. Typically all the content is pretty much rotated so fast on reddit, so it would never be the case that someone would click next 10 times and not be happy about not seeing the old links as visited.

Access the search UI using the hardware button when on the threads list.  Currently there's no way to sort results but that's what I'm doing now.  The goal is to have all of the functionality present on reddit, including sorting, the ability to limit the search the current subreddit (if applicable) and show the tips displayed on the website.  Let me know what you think, and obviously any feedback is welcome.

zagaberoo/diode,open,Search functionality,[],"Last december I and another individual implemented basic search capability.  It kind of got put on hold for a few months but now I'm working on it again.  

At the moment it's probably not ready for prime time.  Currently there's no way to sort results but that's what I want to do next, though I'm not sure how to build that into the UI.

Feel free pull what I have and/or give me feedback.

Now a few things:
- I put DelTagHandler class in in.shick.diode.common package, for lack of a better idea, you may want to move it somewhere else,
- pretty much all of the code in DelTagHandler class comes from [this Stack Overflow post.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4044509/android-how-to-use-the-html-taghandler)
  Do you think that it would be appropriate to give some credit to the author? Maybe in a comment?

Ask me if you have any questions. I'm going to sleep now, I'll be reachable in 9-10 hours.
