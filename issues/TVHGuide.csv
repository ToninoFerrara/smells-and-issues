john-tornblom/TVHGuide,closed,Feature request: Show next show in channel listing.,[],"One of the most useful feature on the old ""TVHGuide by John Törnblom "" is showing the current show and the next show.

One suggestion. The current show title display in bold or higher font size than the next show title. It is very useful to zapping.

Thanks for this great app.

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,open,LAN with IPv4 + IPv6,[],"There is a problem on LANs with IPv6, where DNS provides both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. TVHeadend itself only serves on IPv4, even if the box it is on is dual stack. When getting the name (from DNS), TVHGuide picks up the IPv6 address in preference over the IPv4, and tries to connect on IPv6, which results in connection refused.

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,open,A couple of features,[],"I would like to see a couple of features implemented. I use one rather specific TVHeadend service via internet which lacks channel logos and sometimes EPG.

So it will be fine to have an option to allow channel logos be taken from some folder on sd card or whatever location (with simple mapping by channel name so user will be responsible to rename individual *.png files to match channel name).

Another thing I will find useful is the ability to launch player more easily. If cannel is missing EPG there is no second screen after tapping on channel in list, so I am forced to use long tap to bring up context menu. Not that big issue though…

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,open,New EPG List activities,[],"- Ported to Android 4.0 to support software based settings menu
- Added hours list view activity of EPG data
- Added primetime based list view activity of EPG data
- Added EPG Timeline view activity to EPG data supporting dynamic loading of data

Missing features:
- Due to port to Android 4.0 I had to remove custom titlebar with loading progressbar, any replacement would be nice
- Icons to new views/activities

first of all: thank you for this great app, this saved many times my day :-)

I downloaded the sources of TVHGuide two or three days ago and added some (useful?) features and I wanted to ask you if you eventually would merge this to your branch. I would like to have a way to contact you directly with a little more privacy. Do you see a way and have a little time to chat a little about this? I'm sorry, but due to the lack of sending mails over github (or I simply didn't find a way) I opened this ticket...

Regards,
Johann

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,closed,Connection problem - Android 4.0.3,[],"Hi John,
Having problems connecting using the newest/updated version. App has server+port, username+pass. Initially appears to be connecting and then just sits at Loading and doesn't get any further.
In TVH I see:

Apr 14 21:37:49 [   INFO]:htsp: Got connection from 192.168.55.1
Apr 14 21:37:49 [   INFO]:htsp: 192.168.55.1: Identified as user android

Apr 14 21:37:51 [   INFO]:htsp: 192.168.55.1 [ android | org.tvheadend.tvhguide ]: Disconnected

So it appears the client disconnects too early. I've left it sitting at the ""Loading"" prompt for a while to see if it was trying to do something on the phone but doesn't get anywhere. tcpdump confirms that no other network activity is seen.

I've also captured logcat from my android (rooted so can help diagnose if needed) which is at: http://pastebin.com/1jQ7UUM9
Which although points at image caching problems (some of my chan's don't have them so understandable) it seems to give up at the end on the connection.

Any ideas?

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,closed,Sometimes live streaming stops,[],"Hi, I'm using **TVHGuide v1.5.2** (from Google Play) together with **TVHeadend 3.3.392~g2dcbc36** and I want to play the live channel streams over wifi with **MX Player Pro**.

Normally it works but after some time (which may be variable but always happens) the video stops and the stream closes (i.e. MX Player exits).
On TVHeadend I see this log for example:

```

I think that there is some error and the application ""gives up"" too shortly and closes the stream.

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,closed,UI Update,[],"Hey John,

Here are the files for the UI update...

Had to spend some time in the java-classes for the UI to get it all to work....

Added a generic ""utility"" class (to help support re-formatting the dates, so when it's ""today"", the date shows ""today"" or ""tomorrow"", which (imho) is a lot nicer and easier to read for end-users...

I have previously built a XBMC control-GUI for GBPVR (a Windows based PVR solution), and I had that in there as well, makes things just a little easier...

I didn't spend much time on the ""standard"" listactivities, but more on the details-screens and the top-header for the programme-section. The ""eye"" icon (I included the svg-file I used to generate it), is actually a button that starts the player when clicked....

Have a look 'round... I pulled the ""external player"" support and will start playing with the fragmenst and actionbar, drop me a mail if you have questions / issues; I'll drop you a mail when I've played 'round with fragments etc. some more, and hopefully give you some screenshots for tablet UI...

john-tornblom/TVHGuide,closed,External Player Support,[],"Hey,

First off, congratulations on the excellent work you have been done on the HTSP client... It's a project that was my on my ""what to do if I ever get time"" list... That being said, after having just gotten my ASUS tablet I couldn't help tweaking your code a little bit to make it usable (right now) on my tablet (and I am now able to show live TV on the tablet, it's so cool!!!!)

I've made some minimal changes that allow an end-user to choose between the embedded player (which I can see you are working on hard) and an external player. I've had excellent success with both VPlayer and Dracoon video players (both available in the market).... On my tablet, they're easily fast enough to decode the streams and display them...

This change makes it usable for me (and it's only a few lines of code), so I hope you'll be pulling it in...

I also have some idea's about the UI, but I'll contact you by email about that, and see if it is possible / you are willing to do some co-operation on that....
