paulmach/Text-Edit-for-Android,open,A NullPointerException bug,[],"Hi, thanks for developing this useful app. We recently tested this app by an automated Android GUI testing tool developed by our research team. We found the app could run into a ""NullPointerException"" error after executing the following actions:

start the app -> press ""menu"" key -> choose the ""open"" menu item -> delete the original file name ""/sdcard/"" in the EditText on the appearing dialog titled with ""Open File"" -> fill in ""test"" in the EditText -> click ""open"" -> click ""continue"" button on the appearing dialog titled with ""test not found"" -> the app crashed

Here is the log:

 W/dalvikvm( 1076): threadid=1: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x40a13300)

We carefully inspected the source code, and found the root cause lies in the following code (in ""pmTextEdit.java"" file)

Could you please take a look and confirm this bug? Thanks!

paulmach/Text-Edit-for-Android,open,File Browser Box is Black (shows nothing); issue in 1.5 and earlier on Honeycomb,[],"When I try to open the file browser, the box appears black on my Motorola Xoom tablet (currently running Android Honeycomb 3.2, stock, never rooted or modified in any way).  This does not happen on my Samsung Vibrant (currently running Android Froyo 2.2 KA6 revision, stock, never rooted or modified in any way).  Since I can't attach a screenshot to this ticket, I have taken a screenshot and uploaded it to the following URL:

As you can see, the file browser box is black and shows nothing.  If I click on anything, it does nothing.  If you'd like a log capture, I will send one to you directly upon request.

paulmach/Text-Edit-for-Android,closed,Cannot re-open file that is already open,[],"Description:
Text Edit will not reopen(refresh) a file that is already open.  This is an issue if you use programs/services that update files automatically (Aka Dropbox / Ubuntu One) 

Test Case:
Open test.txt file
Alter and save text.txt with different application.
Switch back to Text Edit. 
Open the test.txt again.  (To reload changes) 
Text File show the file that is already open without the changes from the other program.  

[Work around]
Had to 'Clear Data' (loosing settings) and 'Force Stop' Text Edit to reread the file again.  

[Environment]
Text Edit 1.4.1
Motorola Droid A855
Android 2.2.2 build FRG83G

paulmach/Text-Edit-for-Android,open,Cannot edit on DroidX w\ Gingerbread when Auto Link is on,[],"I have a .TXT file with a couple URLs and some numbers. When Auto Link is on and I open it with Text Edit, the cursor is not available in the file. I also do not have the little nub thingy that allows you to easily move the cursor around. Tapping into sentences does not reveal the cursor. Hitting backspace will show the cursor at the very start of the file, but I cannot move it. The only way to be able to edit this file (and get the nub thingy back) is to turn off Auto Link, edit the file and then turn Auto Link back on.

Droid X
Android 2.3.3

this is a very nice app and I understand you don't want to add features for the sake of it, but it'd be really nice if it remembered your last position in the file for each of your recent files

thanks!

paulmach/Text-Edit-for-Android,closed,doesn't refresh the last file found on sdcard,[],"when you open and save a file from sd card from text edit, it will be loaded next time you open it, as expected. But if meanwhile you edit this file from another application (from your android phone, or from a computer connected on the phone's sd card), the data won't be refreshed from text edit's memory, displaying only the last version saved from text edit, and not the real file on the sdcard.
