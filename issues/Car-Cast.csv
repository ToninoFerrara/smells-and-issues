Here's a small thing that's been bugging me.  Perhaps it bugs you and/or others too.

Whenever you edit a subscription, the URL text box gets the focus.  So the keyboard jumps onto the screen.  Usually, that's not what I want.

You can get to this activity in one of three ways:
- From the subscription list (`Edit`); in which case we probably don't want to edit the URL, rather change one of the other settings.  So don't focus the URL.
- From the `Add` entry on the subscription list menu; in which case it _does_ make sense to focus the URL; that's probably where the user will type/paste next.
- From externally; in which case we already have a URL, so we're unlikely to want to change it; so don't focus it.

I promise.  After this, I have just one change I'm interested in proposing.  Well, for the time being.  So I'll be off your back soon.

Thanks for the great work!

"
bherrmann7/Car-Cast,closed,Better ordering of priority podcasts.,[],"Hi Bob,

Thanks for taking yesterday's PR.

Here's some better code for inserting new priority podcasts when the currently-playing file is in `podcast-order.txt`.  I hope you'll consider it.  Basically, it ensures that multiple podcasts from a single priority subscription remain in the order in which they otherwise would have been.

Say we have: `CP, P1, P2, N1` in `podcast-order.txt` (the first being the Current podcast, the next two from a Priority subscription, and the fourth a Non-priority podcast.

Now, we download two new podcasts, `P3` and `P4` from the same subscription.  And let's say that this is order that the user has selected via ""Newest first"" on the subscription page.  So this is the order the user wants.

With the code I submitted yesterday, we end up with `CP, P4, P3, P1, P2, N1`.  Why? because, in effect, podcasts are added individually.  A new `MetaHolder` is created after each podcast is downloaded.

This PR fixes the order to `CP, P1, P2, P3, P4, N1`, which I think is more intuitive:
- after the current podcast, we get the priority podcasts in the same order as they otherwise would have been, followed by any remaining podcasts.

And, podcasts from a single subscription always end up in the correct order, whether they're in `podcast-order.txt` or not.

Thanks,
   Steve
"
bherrmann7/Car-Cast,closed,Priority subscriptions.,[],"Hi Bob,

I've another pull request which I hope you'll consider.  This one is considerably more complicated than the previous one, so here's a bit of a walk through...

The idea is to add priority subscriptions.  I have a long list of subscriptions and a long list of downloaded podcasts.  However, there are a couple of subscriptions which -- when there's a new episode -- I absolutely want to listen to it next.  In my case, this is typically coverage of multi-day sports events.  For somebody else, it might be a daily news briefing or the like.

The idea: add a `priority` checkbox to the subscription activity and have newly-downloaded priority podcasts added immediately after the currently-playing file.

The changes are fairly substantial.

First, I added the checkbox and fixed the code that reads/writes subscriptions such that it can handle both old-style and new-style subscriptions.  I see you've made similar changes in the past. Then I pushed the new `priority` property through the download logic such that we know a podcast's priority at the point where it's downloaded.

For priority podcasts, I changed the way file are named.  Where previously it was `XXXXX.mp3` (where `XXXXX` is the timestamp) now it's `YYYYY-XXXXX.mp3`, where `XXXXX` is as before, but `YYYYY` is the timestamp of the currently-playing file.  The idea is that priority podcasts will just sort into the right place. 

Aside:  I also changed the sort order from being based on file creation/modification time to being based on the actual file name.

Up to this point, everything works fine.  Except if there is a `podcast-order.txt` file present and the currently-playing podcast is one of the files named therein.

So there are two cases.  The simple case where the sort on the file name does the trick, and a second case where a newly-encountered file is inserted at the correct position within the initial `metas` list.

Sorry, it's long and a touch tricky.  I hope you'll nevertheless take the time to work through it.

Many thanks,
   Steve

bherrmann7/Car-Cast,closed,Add receivers for broadcast intents.,[],"Hi.

I wonder if you might consider incorporating the attached.

It implements three broadcast receivers for CC:

- `com.jadn.cc.services.external.PLAY` (begin playback)
- `com.jadn.cc.services.external.PAUSEPLAY` (toggle play/pause)

Why?  Because these let me control CC from Tasker (or any similar automation app).

For example, I can have CC begin playback automatically when headphones are inserted, but -- in my case -- only in the morning.  I use a different audio app in the evening.

I'm not too familiar with Android intent handling, so there may be a better way to achieve the same thing.  But, at least this doesn't seem to break anything.

When I move the short one to the top it will say I am 15 minutes into a 5 min podcast. I need to skip ahead and back again to get the app back to sanity.

Because I like to keep all other applications auto rotating but in my opinion it is no use to rotate carcast buttons interface. 

The cons is interface inconsistency on a slow smartphone.
Often when I am handling the phone, (putting the phone close to my ear or getting into the car or laying down on bed) the accelerometer senses a tilt and rotates. The app immediately remaps touch sensitive areas to new button positions, but the graphical redraw is slow hence for a couple of seconds I still see the old button layout.

1. Play a podcast.

The podcast I was listening to stopped playing and when I returned to the playing screen it had been reset to 0:00.

This is an example of the situation we have discussed previously where Car Cast doesn't maintain the current location of a playing podcasts.

Could Car Cast automatically retain the current location of playing podcasts before leaving the playing screen? Like pressing ""Pause"" does?

While downloading some podcasts a counter is shown on the download page like this:

Sometimes the first part of of the counter goes further that the last part. I take that must be a programming mistake that can easily be corrected. According to my understanding the first number should reach the second number and then start downloading the next episode. This is purely a cosmetic problem since the podcasts are downloaded error free.

bherrmann7/Car-Cast,closed,Foreground mode,[],"Hi,

thanks for carcast, I'm using it everyday.
Is there a reason why you don't use the android foreground mode? I have a Mot Milestone (Droid) which is a bit underpowered and if there is a lot happening on the device (navigation + general sync) sometimes CC gets stuttery or gets killed. There is the ""Foreground mode"" for apps in Android to improve scheduling for the app and avoid getting killed, specifically for things like music players.

bherrmann7/Car-Cast,closed,Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException(HTTP redirects) and added Ogg Vorbis,[],"Hi Bob,

see subject :)

Seems like Android is not handling HTTP redirects very well. The InputStream of the connection does return the response body from the original request. What we want however is the response body from the _redirected request_.
Caveat: the new code is assuming that it's a HTTP url. If you want to support others (e.g. file://) it needs some more massaging (e.g. some instanceof).

As for Ogg Vorbis support: I added the file extension plus the mime type (also for mp3) to the audio recognition method.
Caveat: I introduced the new property mimetype to MetaNet => this affects backwards compatibility, see MetaNet.getMimetype() for details.

Hope this helps
