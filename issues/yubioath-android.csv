I set both slots to static passwords just to try it out, and it works fine. So is it using the U2F mode of my Yubikey then (which doesn't consume a configuration slot)?
2. How exactly does the app store the secrets for the the TOTP accounts I add to this app? Are they stored in plain text somewhere on my phone, and the app merely doesn't generate the 6 digit codes derived from the secrets until I tap my Yubikey? Or are they stored encrypted, and only decrypted when I tap my Yubikey? Or are the secrets stored on the Yubikey itself?

One other issue perhaps related to this that I've noticed is that I have at least once had the codes displayed which are actually 'next' in the sequence; i.e., the codes were different to that shown in QuickAuth on my pebble watch, but after QA cycled to the next set, they were the same as those shown in Yubico Authenticator.

Yubico/yubioath-android,open,Feature request: Time synchronization,[],"Google Authenticator (at least as of 4.44) has time correction. This would be useful for people without root access and/or ClockSync installed, not to mention various kinds of local network restrictions. Unknown whether GAuth's facility actually sets the system time, but at minimum it should be able to get the correct time for one-shot TOTP.

SNTP would be appreciated, along with the ability to set one or more NTP servers (default CC.pool.ntp.org ?)

If there isn't already suitable SNTP code available for Android, the simplest method would be to use ""HTP"" and allow the user to select a server to sync against (default www.google.com?)

""HTP"": http://linux.die.net/man/8/htpdate

It would also be great if the app got a bit of a UI overhaul a la GAuth 4.44, but I'd guess that would be a low priority... 😉

I haven't been able to find a reliable way of triggering this, but it seems that sometimes onNewIntent is called before onResume, leaving tagDispatcher = null. I've looked at the tutorial for Nordpol, and it seems to follow the same pattern of instantiating tagDispatcher in onResume, deactivating it in onPause, and calling tagDispatcher.interceptIntent() in onNewIntent. @Franzaine, @petter-fidesmo any suggestions on how to do this in a better way? A simple null check would obviously solve the NPE, but if you have any better suggestions please let me know!

Stock Samsung galaxy S6, SM-G920F
Android 5.1.1
Build LMY47X.G920FXXU3COI9

Update:
Did some testing, and I'm getting mixed results. This is purely an amateurs  fiddling, but here goes.

Version 1.0.2 worked to a near 100%. After updating to 1.0.3, I was unable to retrieve my codes, even after 15-20 attempts. After submitting this Github issue, I tried several things. 
1. Cleared app cash and data, forced stopped the app and tried to read the yubikey 4-5 times. No luck.
2. Cleared app cash and data, uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Tried to read the yubikey 4-5 times. No luck
3. Forced closed the app, and tried the yubikey directly from the homescreen (which I never usually do) and heard the nfc success sound and was shown the ""choose standard app"" menu. I chose the Yubico Auth app with the ""Just Once"" option. The app opened, but no codes. But then i tried the yubikey again with the app opened, and this time I heard the nfc failure sound but it worked and the codes were shown. Now I no longer get the ""choose app"" menu when trying from the homescreen, and it never takes me to the Yubico Auth app, but i does give the nfc success sound. But if I open the app and try from there, it works about 20% of the time even though I always get the nfc failure sound. It's working in a manner, but in a far less reliable way than the 1.0.2 version.

It is very handy to be able to do this. e.g. I add a new service, for a remote SSH login to  a server on a remote site which uses pam_google_authenticator. Since there is only one system at the remote site, I call it ""site1"".

A few months later, I add another service for a different server at that site. I would like to rename my existing ""site1"" to ""site1-serverA"", so I can now add ""site1-serverB"".

Yubico/yubioath-android,closed,Samsung Galaxy S5 NFC Service Crashes,[],"See http://forum.yubico.com/viewtopic.php?t=1646

I can read the NEO once with the S5 without problem, trying to read it once again just seams to hang the nfc processes on the phone. If i disable NFC on the phone and enable it again I'm able to read the NEO once more. When it's not possible to read the NEO it's not possible to read any other NFC tags. Same scenario works with out problem on S3,S4,Z3 and so on.

Background:
Model: SM-G900F
Android 4.4.2
Kernel 3.4.0-2089850
Baseband: G900FXXU1ANG2

Symptoms:
After one read(successful OR failed), it will not read again

Workarounds:
- wait at least a minute then try again(does not always work, 50/50...)
- disable/enable NFC
- lock/unlock the phone

Comments:
On the first attempt, the S5 seems to be able to successfully read the Neo only about 50% of the time, sometimes I get error ""Unfortunately, NFC Service has stopped"", but most times it just simply will not read again until doing one of the above 'workarounds'. After a failed read, if I immediately exit the Yubico Authenticator then re-load it, I get message ""NFC is disabled"" but when I check, it is actually enabled. So it seems that the NFC service is crashing for some reason. Note: I have never seen ""NFC is disabled"" message after a successful read, but it still will not read again until doing one of the workarounds above.

Additional Info:
Adb logcat says when scanning Neo first time:

When trying to scan ANY tag after this, nothing happens.

The 2 last lines look not to good, in my eyes at least... Doing the same on S3 doesn't provide as much detail

D/NfcService( 2940): tag value : none

Authy has some really good ideas here in terms of user-friendliness.

Yubico/yubioath-android,closed,Change default state of 'save password' checkbox?,[],"Hi!

I currently have the app installed on a Nexus 5, running stock.  I opted to have the app prompt me for a password when I first swipe the NEO, presumably for added security.

However, the 'save password' checkbox just underneath the password field defaults as checked.

Is there any way to change this behavior so that one has to manually check the box to save the password? If I were to forget to uncheck the box when I use the app, it seems like I would probably have to clear the password and re set it in order to get the app to prompt me for a password again.

Yubico/yubioath-android,closed,Added NFC intent to go straight to app,[],"One more PR from me. I thought it would be useful to go straight to the ListCodes part of the app when the YubiKey NFC intent fires. I'm not an android dev, so this code is entirely non-optimal, but it at least seems to work on my limited set of hardware.

The AndroidManifest.xml now has a filter which listens for a YubiKey neo NDEF_DISCOVERED which should load the main activity. Then, there's some code in onResume which checks the intent, and if it's NDEF_DISCOVERED runs almost the same code again as what's in onIntent. The main difference is that if the password is required, I couldn't figure out how to display the password window - getFragmentManager() seems to return null. I just show a toast instead.

So there's some duplication that's largely unnecessary. Hopefully a useful starting point for what might be quite a useful feature.
