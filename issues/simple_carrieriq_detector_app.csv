project-voodoo/simple_carrieriq_detector_app,closed,Bug is causing this app to turn my phone off?,[],"I know this sounds strange, I've never heard of such a thing. I'm running Android 2.2 with Motoblur. Non-rooted. Using GO EX and a lockscreen changer but nothing too fancy. When I run the app it opens and starts ""checking"" for CIQ then the phone turns off. I don't think it's a fluke because I turned my phone on and tried again and the same thing happened. Screen goes black and I have to turn it on again.

Also left this in a review of the app on the market.

I have no idea what could be going on. I am learning to be a developer so if need be I can take the source and see if I get any errors in LogCat. Unless I'm alone in experiencing this issue.

Still learning git; let me know if I did something wrong by pulling romanbb's commits into mine before the pull request :)
