I add my Password Generator button to the project, based on [Python diceware_utils](https://github.com/patarapolw/diceware_utils). I actually want to use NLTK for [memorable-password](https://github.com/patarapolw/memorable-password)... 

Plan: Add one more button - password generator options.

adrian/upm-android,open,Use HTTP GET to download the db file and patch up multipart POST syntax,[],"The proposed changes fix adrian/upm-android#19 issue, enabling the use
of HTTP GET method instead of static HTTP POST to download the database
file.

The use of LF (instead of CRLF) confuses CGI.pm if CGI.pm is used to
process HTTP uploads. The proposed changes enable processing of HTTP
uploads by a custom CGI script in addition to, or as a replacement of,
the current PHP scripts.

adrian/upm-android,open,Invalid password message,[],"I'm having a issue accessing the app using my backed up data.  I have the android app for UPM. I had the data backed up on my computer desktop.  My phone had to be reset.  I have now re-installed the app and successfully put the backed up data on my phone where the app can access it.  

The issue I'm still having is that when I try to enter my password (same one I have always used for UPM), I get an ""Invalid password"" message and I can't access the data.  Any suggestions as to what I can do? 

Thank you.
"
adrian/upm-android,open,Should sync on start,[],"Given that dropbox sync used, next case may lead to partial data lose:
1 alter database on android but not uploaded (don't sync)
2 alter database with PC client
3 sync on android

Because after (2) dropbox will have newer DB - the altered but not uploaded DB on Android will be overwritten.

Probably auto sync on start and before close may lower chance for this.

adrian/upm-android,open,UPM is incorrectly using HTTP post to download the DB file,[],"According to the [W3C specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html), POST is used for making changes on the server, not for fetching content (especially static content).  UPM is incorrectly using POST to try to fetch the initial DB download, which is causing failures for web servers which (correctly) disallow POST for fetching static content (such as nginx).

UPM Android should use GET to fetch static content.

This way if some unauthorized person picked up your phone, or stole your phone, they would not already be logged into your password database. A VERY IMPORTANT SECURITY FEATURE if you ask me.

Please consider adding this as perhaps a menu option. You may also consider a user select-able time out auto log off selection. say 30 sec, 1 min, 5 min etc.

Most user's won't do this since the repercussions aren't obvious, i.e. if the device is lost or bricked there's no way to recover your password database.

- Backup automatically every n days
- Prompt the user to backup every n days
- Forget about keeping the database on internal storage altogether and use the SD card instead
