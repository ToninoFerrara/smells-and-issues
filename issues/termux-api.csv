termux/termux-api,closed,Add KeystoreAPI,[],"Requires [termux-api-package #33](https://github.com/termux/termux-api-package/pull/33).

This patch adds an interface for [Android keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore). You can read all the features on that page, but I believe the main benefit of using it is [extraction prevention](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore#ExtractionPrevention).

In short, Android keystore allows the storage of cryptographic keys inside a secure hardware. The key is generated inside the chip, and it never leaves the hardware - actually the chip does not even have a function to export the secret key.

Even with root privileges, it is not possible to extract these keys.

Instead, the applications ask the chip to sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt a particular piece of data in behalf of them, and the hardware does this inside itself and outputs the result. Again, the secret key always stays inside the chip.

This script provides 5 commands:
* list: List all the keys stored inside the keystore.
* generate: Generate a key securely inside the chip.
* sign: Create a signature for given data.
* verify: Verify if some signature is valid for given data.
* delete: Delete the key from the keystore.

(Note that the *verify* action is for convenience only, due to the way asymmetric encryption works anyone can do the verification given the public key.)

Example commands to test:
1. `termux-keystore generate myAlias -a RSA -s 2048`
2. `termux-keystore list`
3. `echo ""test file"" >> testfile`
4. `termux-keystore sign myAlias SHA512withRSA < testfile > signature`
5. `termux-keystore verify myAlias SHA512withRSA signature < testfile # should return true`
6. `echo ""different file"" >> differentfile`
7. `termux-keystore verify myAlias SHA512withRSA signature < differentfile # should return false`

Although by itself this is a complete tool, the API becomes much more useful when combined with a middleware that I have created: [tergent](https://github.com/aeolwyr/tergent) (short for termux-ssh-agent). This small application is a ssh-agent implementation that uses this backend to store the keys inside the chip. This provides the security of hardware-based tokens without the inconvenience of carrying a separate device - the chip acts as the secure component.

I'm not sufficiently familiar with the android toolchain and the termux build system to fix it myself, but if I don't see a response for a while, I might give it a shot because I'd really like to be able to share the clipboard with vim on my chromebook."
termux/termux-api,open,How to merge Termux-app and Termux-api in a single project,[],"Hello, I'm trying to generate a single project from those both projects so the output will be a single apk file.
To do this i googled about 'how to merge two android-studio projects in a single project' and i found out that the best way is using libraries, I mean making one a library and adding to the other one using it as a module dependency, it seems to work with any other add-on of termux-app (for example it worked with termux-boot and termux-float) but when i tried to do it with termux-api i found out that there were some 'old way to use' the xml resources files, but it seems to respect all the suggestions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-plugin-3-0-0-migration)  even though after adding it as a module dependency (and after fixing the manifest file following the suggestions of AS 3.1) i got the error below:

In the last week, I have googled a lot about it and i had no success, I tried some possible answers like:

- adding implementation ""com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.0.+"" in the build.gradle file
- disabling instant run
- merging them through git
- moving to AS 3.0

but without success, I was wondering if there is any guide about how to merge them in the right way or if it is already the 'right' way if there is someone that already figured out the solution.

The steps that i did to make termux-app and termux-boot/float work are these:

1. Download both projects.
2. Modify the build.gradle of termux-boot and made it a library deleting the ApplicationID, shrinkResources line and changing 'com.android.application' to 'com.android.library'.
3. Rebuild to generate the aar file in order to add it to termux-app project
4. From termux-app project click on menu 'File/New/New Module' added the file aar.
5. Added the dependecy by clicking on 'File/Project Structure/', click on 'app', click on 'dependencies' and on '+' in order to add the dependecy.
6. Android studio will show a problem with the manifest merged, open the manifest file and clicked on all the 'suggestions' of android-studio to solve the merge problem.

termux/termux-api,closed,termux-dialog hangs if dialog loses focus.,[],"Since the update of the DialogAPI, it is now possible for termux-dialog to hang if the dialog box loses focus.
For example: I use the Password Store app, which can prompt to autofill passwords. If my GPG passphrase is not in memory, it needs to prompt me for that in turn. So, if I have a termux-dialog asking for a password, and I ask Password Store to autofill it, and it asks me for my GPG passphrase, then the original termux-dialog loses focus and disappears. With the old DialogAPI this caused termux-dialog to exit, but now it just hangs, and I need to terminate it manually."

termux/termux-api,closed,AudioAPI: updates for AudioTrack methods,[],"There are several changes in the commit:

1. Use instance methods to get sample rate and buffer size info
on Android N or above only instead of Android M, since both
AudioAttributes.FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (256) and the implicitly used
AudioFormat.SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED (0) are available only since
API 24 (N).

2. Use setPerformanceMode() on Android O, as FLAG_LOW_LATENCY is
deprecated since API 26 (O).

3. Create AudioTrack instance of both the fast (LOW_LATENCY) and
deep buffer (POWER_SAVING) mixer path. The two paths can be using
different subdevices on different rate and buffer size (or same
subdevice on same rate but different buffer size). For example on
my phone:

AUDIOTRACK_SAMPLE_RATE: 192000
AUDIOTRACK_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_FRAMES: 23046
AUDIOTRACK_SAMPLE_RATE_LOW_LATENCY: 48000
AUDIOTRACK_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_FRAMES_LOW_LATENCY: 192

4. Get info on sample rate with the getNativeOutputSampleRate()
static method (static in Java's sense; the value is still sink-
based) on builds older than N only. The rate appears to be of the
fast (LOW_LATENCY) mixer path if it is available.

5. A note on the static method getMinBufferSize(). The reason it
is not used even for older devices is, it returns buffer size info
of the deep buffer (POWER_SAVING) mixer path, while NOSR is the
rate of the fast (LOW_LATENCY) mixer path, so the value we can get
with it is not always sensical."

Note that it would probably crash even if `command` is `switch`ed without `toUpperCase`.

Btw, what's the point of the `toUpperCase` anyway?

One problem I'm having is that super low cost carriers that try to  do as much as possible with voip (Freedompop for example) instead of using the cell networks seem to run their messanging apps in ""parallel"" to the default Android Messenger and thus termux-sms-send messages end up in Android Messenger instead of the app that would actually send them.  I see them in the conversation ""history"" but they never get sent, despite the proprietary messaging being set as the default. 

Would it be possible to add an alternate termux method, say something like termux-sms-sendx , or a command line option switch to use Implicit Intents as an alternative to using the SMS Manager API?  

I found this code snippet for using implicit intends:
```
String phoneNumber = ""9999999999"";
String smsBody = ""This is an SMS!"";

// Add the phone number in the data
Uri uri = Uri.parse(""smsto:"" + phoneNumber);
// Create intent with the action and data
Intent smsIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO, uri);
// smsIntent.setData(uri); // We just set the data in the constructor above
// Set the message
smsIntent.putExtra(""sms_body"", smsBody);

startActivity(smsIntent);
```

I don't know how you'd specify the alternate app.  

I've never done any real Android programming although years ago at the Android 2.4 level, I did write a java method to talk to a proprietary device over Bluetooth to stream the data to Android, a real Android programmer used it -- he didn't understand the external device, I didn't understand Android, it was an efficient solution to the task.

in a recent post on G+ Termux community, a community member asked if it was possible to change the Android background from Termux; and I though the Termux-api package might be a great way to implement that feature. This could lend itself to really cool Termux scripts to change the Android backgrounds. I was just looking at a package for Linux recently, that changes the wallpaper based on the weather; and if this feature were to be implemented it could make things like that and so much more possible from Termux.

The `termux-storage-getfile` mechanism gives no way to preserve the original filename.

For example, calling `termux-storage-getfile` without a destination filename, causes the script to create a file with the same name of the file that is selected in the popup and copies into it.

termux/termux-api,open,Idea/Question: REST-API,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I like to make/have termux-api available via REST, for example:

Android: 
```

```
PC:
```
% curl 'http://192.168.2.100:8091/camera-photo?c=1'
```
retrieves JPEG direct

```
% curl http://192.168.2.100:8091/camera-info
```
retrieves JSON

etc. essentially  `http://x.x.x.x:port/(\w+)?(.+)` -> `termux-$1 $2` (with some proper argument parsing)

**Question**: what would be the easiest way (programming framework) to implement this lightweight http server providing the functionality?

I quickly coded (2hr) perl script which implements basic web-server which calls termux-* (with simple argument parsing) and takes output to return to http GET request, yet, it might be more suitable to use termux-api.c direct and put a small web-server into it, which connects to the internal API instead via termux-* -> termux-api -> am -> tcp.

I like to probe multiple android phones for battery info (actually the battery temperature is what I care about) and take photos via REST, turning Android smartphones into IoT devices.

```
termux-rest (0.0.2) services:
   battery-status
   camera-info
   camera-photo: c=<...>
   location
   telephony-cellinfo
   telephony-deviceinfo
   tts-engines
   tts-speak: speak=<...>
   vibrate

with `Content-Type: text/html`, each service listed is a link.

Thought you'd find this interesting; I rewrote in Go the C tool and scripts from the `termux-api` tools normally installed through apt to use this App. In theory, this means you can compile Go apps that make calls to `termux-api` to use the APIs from Go.

Lots of it is completely untested, including things like ""sending Stdin down a Unix pipe"". Only some tools have been tested at all.

Also, the struct values for SMS messages from SmsInbox and from TTS engines are currently unknown because I get no results for these on my phone (SMSsecure protects sms, and no TTS engines).

Thanks for a great app, I'm looking forward to playing with pure-Go pseudo-apps thanks to Termux. :)
