farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Ability to resize&move widgets within grid,[],
farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Ability to adjust taskbar height,[],"Hi! First of all I want to say thanks for single-handedly making modern smartphone interfaces usable for something else than passively consuming endlessly scrolling social media. ;) I'm not exaggerating here, this has made it possible to make my modern phone regain some of the functionality my old PDA had, meaning I can get a lot more work done both faster and more efficient than before and I'm very grateful. :)

Now, to my question. Would it be possible to implement a setting for scaling, or rather, the height of the taskbar? I am using an active stylus, so I don't really need the huge buttons and it would be perfect if I could make it about half the standard size. I went through all the options several times but couldn't find something like this.

Either way, thanks again! This should be app of the year!"
farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Home Screen replacement not working on Android Pie,[],"With Android 8 on my Pixel XL, Taskbar was the home screen replacement only when running, and when Taskbar was off it reverted back to my default home screen. That is no longer working with Android 9. Now, either taskbar is the home screen replacement (even when off), or it shows as an overlay on the default homescreen."

farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Issue on Fire OS,[],"Fist off, y device uses fire OS, and maybe that causes the issue. The start button is there and works fine, but no recent apps appear on the taskbar. In addition, I do not have any ability to drag the windows. Thanks, the app looks great!"
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Doesn't compile on Windows 10,[],"So I was attempting to test this out on Windows 10 using Android Studio and I couldn't get it to compile.  This is because the app/src/compat-27 file is supposed to be a symlink to the app/src/compat-26 folder.  But when cloning using gitbash it actually just comes through as a text file.

My solution was to delete the compat-27 file and re-create the symlink in gitbash."

farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,"Is it possible to designate particular app window ""always on top""",[],"I love the app very much.

The only issue is when I want to run video in mx player inside a window and have a full screen note taking app (or a window of note taking app resized to full screen) behind the mx player. When I click on note taking app behind mx player, the mx player gets hidden behind the note taking app. I want the mx player app to stay always on top.

Is it possible to designate certain window always on top?"
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Recents suggestion,[],Please add the abilityy to have x number of past days of recents showing. I like to have more than just the past day of recents on the bar.   It would be nice to see a greater number of my recent apps (even from more than a week ago) on the bar and not have a bunch of them disappear if I restart taskbar. Ie have abilty to display apos launched within past month etc and not just past day.  Yhank you! 
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Fix crashing and add versionName,[],
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Please make the hidden launch icon optional,[],"I love this program! I've been using android TV PCs as thin clients against Windows for a long time. Remix provided the best experience, but being underpowered it would sometimes drop keystrokes and video would not play full screen. After replacing the android boxes I've been searching for something good. This Taskbar program is it! And I found it by accident. I love the windowing, the ability to launch apps in a window, then close by clicking X.

If the Taskbar start button is at the lower left, it becomes hidden, but active. This is the same location as the Windows start button, making it very hard to click the Windows start button. I configured Taskbar to put the start button at the lower right instead, but I hate that. It isn't natural.

Taskbar does not replace the native android taskbar which is still available and can be shown or hidden. To summon the android OS I unhide the native android taskbar and click home. Because Taskbar is the launcher, clicking home displays it. My use case does not require Taskbar to have a hidden icon. Could this be made optional?"
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,"If launcher, desktop wallpaper offset at startup",[],"I have android 7.1.2 on several TX92 TV PCs. If Taskbar is the default launcher and loaded at startup, wallpaper will occupy the right two-thirds of the screen, only. If Nova Launcher is opened, then closed, wallpaper will properly align with the entire screen.

When using Nova Launcher as the default launcher and loaded at startup, wallpaper corrects as soon as Nova Launcher loads.

This may indicate maintenance needed by Taskbar when it loads as default launcher. Other launchers were tried and they also correct the wallpaper position."
farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Please be kind and intimidate Google implementing all ideas below,[],"Full feature Android for desktop is the future, and You should be part of it. Would love to get rid of proprietary RemoxOS/PhoenixOS on may main station for build from source Android x86."
farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Add tapping an already open app in TaskBar minimizes the app,[],"It would be nice to create a deeper Windows-like function where if you tap the icon of an app that is currently open and active, it minimizes it. 

Thanks for adding full window sized full screen app view! Tapping an app creates a little bubble icon, but you can simply drag it behind the taskbar icon as a temporary (and I'm sure impossible) fix.

I've set up the taskbar to stay expanded, showing all nav buttons, and then the app icons. This is almost fully functional solution for my nova set up, and works very well s as far.

I do think full screen (full sizable I guess is a more accurate word) could be improved. Setting the full height to leave a bit of space at the bottom would be nice, so that we could grab the bottom in order to resize it if we wanted. As of right now, because the height is full, I can't drag it even higher to expose the bottom edge in order to resize the app, for in the instance that j want to manually split screen two or three apps with their own custom sizes.

farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,System restarting error,[],"On Android x86 version 7.0 devices and use freeform mode, use multi window, (bottom and up both) it restart automaticaly."
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,"Shortcut to Open, Tasker, Placement",[],"I have found this app both useful and innovative. I have a couple of requests:

1. Shortcut to Open: It looks like you recently changed the function of the ""Freeform Mode"" shortcut. In the past it used to open the taskbar. Now, however, it appears to toggle the freeform mode without opening the taskbar. 
This change makes perfect sense, but it removes a workaround I used to open taskbar from Tasker or other modes (fingerprint, gesture, etc).
Could you please add a widget/shortcut/activity to open taskbar? With this, I could restore the function I had before.

2. Tasker Integration: Could you add Tasker integration? This would make alternative opening even easier. In addition to a simple open, you may want to add other actions, such as freeform mode, etc.

3. Specific Placement: I believe this request is already on this list (#25), so consider this a ""second."" I would like to be able to alter the placement of the collapsed taskbar beyond the options now available, each corner, horizontal or vertical. Each corner is already a common place for some other UI action, so I find myself opening taskbar when I really want the other action, or vice versa.
If I could offset taskbar a little, both x and y, I could find a place for it that would interfere less with the other stock actions.

Thank you!"
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Ability to display open apps in taskbar,[],"Would it be possible to have a feature to show only apps which are ""open"" (that would mean, currently in the recents drawer I guess)? That would really make it seem more like a taskbar"
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Samsung free window mode,[],"Why Samsung free window mode is unsupported? I have a Samsung tablet and I love my free window mode, but this app would truly make it more desktop like! :) Currently it's launching only full screen for me, even though the free window option is checked. I'm thinking to myself, there must be a way to launch than this way .."
farmerbb/Taskbar,open,Cooperate with Computer Launcher dev to add freeform window mode support,[],"![unnamed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7596867/29991147-bba0f03a-8f82-11e7-8ee1-e47e81df5f9b.png)


Hi,

First of all, Great app !! Great idea. Thanks @farmerbb for making it.

I'm a supporter of Android for PC idea and I'd like to get Android a little closer in that direction.
For now Bliss-x86 (Android-x86 fork) uses Taskbar to have some desktop UI features. 
I personally would rather have somethings like what you see in the image above - the [Computer Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.computer.desktop.ui.launcher)
I spoke to Jon West (@electrikjesus) - the maintainer of Bliss-x86 and he's interested in this app too.
The launcher app is similiar to what you get in Remix and Phoenix OS too. 

**So my question is:
Would you be willing to cooperate with the creator of Computer Launcher to add freeform windows mode to it please?** 
I've send him an email about this just today including your source code repo.
His e-mail is: abdul.haleemapps@gmail.com"
farmerbb/Taskbar,open,"All of my requests in one page. Developer, please read this!",[],"Firstly, I'd like to say thank you SO much for putting so much effort into such a fantastic app. TaskBar has turned my Android device into a desktop version of Android, and it is absolutely stunning.  

I truly believe in this app. It is unlike any other multi window / taskbar app by a hundred miles, so here are some things that I've come up with:


1. Have the taskbar apps consistently placed, including folder support. It's confusing when the apps change places based on last used.  Setting the ""Display apps launched"" to ""After Taskbar start"" and ""Sort order"" to ""Most time used (descending) helps remove the clutter, but they still shift every now and then. I'd like to pin certain apps to the task bar and have them stay in place. If I could combine pinned apps to the task bar, as well as apps beside them ordered by most time used, it would be perfect (and exactly like Windows if you think about it, but even better).

2. Add buttons in the top bar to resize the window (this icon could be on the very left side), align the window (top, bottom, and freeform), minimize, maximize, and close (the last two are there already which is fantastic).

- As of right now, resizing windows is pretty much a guessing game. I love that you allowed us to resize the vertical size from the top AND the bottom, and I'm thankful for the ability to resize the windows in general, but it could use a dedicated resize mode with its own button in the top bar.
- If app is minimized, the icon on the taskbar is highlighted or has an indication that it is running and minimized (similar to what Windows does)
- If an app is maximized, instead of being truly full screen like stock Android does now, it would be perfect if the app actually ALWAYS had the top bar showing, and essentially just filled the screen. With the top bar always showing, we would be able to instantly align, resize, minimize, maximize, and close the app.
*** So true full window mode should essentially not be a thing if the user decides to enable the ""always show the menu bar"" option.

3. Please, please add resizable widgets! 

Not manual pre-set sizes for the entire homescreen.  
Although I'm incredibly thankful to even be able to set Taskbar as the launcher and add widgets, they could also use some work. I would suggest checking out the Nova Launcher and seeing how they handle widget sizing.

So to recap: Make the taskbar more static so apps dont move around, possibly making a hybrid static + most used combination. Add resize, align, and minimize buttons in the top bar, again, similar to Desktop Windows OS. 

This app has so much potential, it's incredible. I will donate a big chunk of money if these features are added!! That is an absolute promise my friend. I've been looking for something like this for YEARS."
farmerbb/Taskbar,closed,Add option to adjust bar's width,[],I'd love to see an option to be able to set the width of the taskbar. I think that a narrower one would cause less problems with keyboards and send buttons
