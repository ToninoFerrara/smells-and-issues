ajlyon/zandy,closed,Missing items and collections,[],"I have some items and collections missing in Zandy. They are available on my computers with firefox+zotero. In addition, some items are not shown all collections they belong to. For instance, one item is show in only two collections although it is really in three (all these collections are in zandy). 

Also, ""View Collections"" shows incorrect number of items for most collections. It shows 0 items for most and ""Stale data"". When clicked, the items are shown (at least those that are not missing from Zandy). If clicking ""Sync"" in such a collection, I get an error ""Unfortunately, Zandy has stopped"" and Zandy restarts. This happens with collections that are shown 0 items although they have items.

I suppose all these problems are caused by some invalid data in some items. Any ideas?

F-droid is a really great market, and is gaining steam and quality, and it would really be great to have Zandy included. Would it be possible to make a f-droid branch, like [aLogCatRoot has done](https://github.com/pedja1/aLogcatRoot/issues/1)?

Or we could just wait for someone in Android to fix it; but given the lack of progress in 4 years I don't feel so hopeful.

In the meantime, could you at least warn users on the forum or the users guide that digest auth doesn't work but basic over https does? (This tested on Zandy 1.4.1 on Android 4.4.2 with Apache 2.4/mod_dav.)

I'm trying to download PDFs saved on my Zotero account for viewing in my android. When I download the attachment by doing a long tap on the ""attachment"" entry, it downloads the PDF but then the viewer gives a message that it's not a valid PDF file.

When I went to the folder on the SD card where the files are saved, it turns out that the problem is that they are saved with _PDF at the end (e.g. _MJW2SJV5Full_Text_PDF). When I change the _PDF to .PDF, the file opens correctly in the adobe reader.

I have this problem with Nexus 7 (Android 4.2.1) and Samsung Galaxy S (Android 2.3.5).

ajlyon/zandy,closed,Long-click behaviour for Collections and PDF attachments,[],"Issue:
I use zandy to access my repository and the pdf attachments from my webdav server.  But right now it takes 2-clicks and 2-long-clicks to read each file.

Long-clicking on collection items in order to view the contents of a collection is frustrating.  I don't know who uses subcollections, but I imagine more people have items in a collection than sub-collections.

Long-clicking to download any pdf attachment is also very frustrating.  

Suggested solution:
I suggest for collections:
long-clicking to list subcollections
short-clicking to list items

long-clicking to view notes
short-clicking to download pdf attachments

ajlyon/zandy,closed,Error when downloading PDF attachments from WEBDAV,[],"Problem:
Receiving dialog box 'View this online?' when trying to download a pdf attachment from a webdav server.  When ""view"" option is selected, the error ""No application available to open URI:"" is given.  

Summary:
I was able to make a few changes to the source code to default to my desired behaviour.  However, I'm not sure what the root cause of this problem is.  Making both changes have helped me access my webdav repository. 

Suggested Solution:
As a quick fix, I suggest you make the following change to AttachmentActivity.java:
int linkMode = row.content.optInt(""linkMode"", Attachment.MODE_LINKED_URL);
to 
int linkMode = row.content.optInt(""linkMode"", Attachment.MODE_IMPORTED_URL);

For some reason or another, the linkMode variable is not assigned, and so I guess the default is to assume the attachment is to follow an URL.  This change would make it default to download from the URL.  Fortunately, downloaded files will not be re-downloaded with this fix, and local copies will be accessed.

This will fix the download issue, but then another problem is that Zandy doesn't not open the pdf.  Again, I don't know why, but it seems that the MimeType variable is not assigned or identified when the pdf attachment is downloaded.  I suggest the following fix to AttachmentActivity.java:
String mimeType = att.content.optString(""mimeType"",null);
to
String mimeType = att.content.optString(""mimeType"",""application/pdf"");

We could support uploading attachments to an intermediate server, and have a small Zotero plugin handle retrieving them and attaching them to the proper item. We could just mark the item with a special tag that provided the info needed for the plugin to go and retrieve the attachment and attach it using desktop Zotero.

I don't know what we would do for the intermediate server, since I can't very well do that on my budget hosting at gimranov.com, and the server costs could rack up if the feature were to take off. For now, food for thought.

This could be used for attaching any local items that happen to be on the Android device (PDFs, whatever), but also for more innovative things, like photos. The latter case leads us towards a new workflow for archival and library ad hoc digitization...

ajlyon/zandy,closed,Reduce required API level,[],"The APK currently requires API Level 8 (Android 2.2), but I'm pretty sure there's not much I'm doing that requires that. I know that dialogs can only be passed bundles in API 8+, but that might well be the only thing holding me back. Moving down to 2.1 or even as low as, say, 1.6, would be great and open up the app to even more people out there with older devices.

Anything aiming for 3.x will probably just share basic logic, but be a separate APK, since the user interface and the libraries used to build it will presumably be different for Honeycomb tablets.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Settings don't stick,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","It appears that settings aren't sticking, so there's no way to set the api key automatically.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Freezes around login,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Two reports of issues involving the login / OAuth process. Need to double-check the handling of failed OAuth attempts (per report on Twitter), and check for possible issues involving the callback upon successful authentication with Zotero.org.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Icon,"[Label(name=""helpwanted""), Label(name=""interface"")]","The current icon was made in about two minutes in Inkscape and really should be replaced.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Indicate sync progress,"[Label(name=""api""), Label(name=""interface"")]","It would be good if we had a sync progress indicator somewhere. A more complex indicator might even let us view and modify the API request queue.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Switching to Zandy using app switcher breaks back button,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","If a user leaves Zandy using the home button from, say, an item list, then returns using the app switcher (long-click on home button), the back button will exit Zandy and return to the previous application. That's unexpected. We need to somehow maintain the back stack.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Syncing everything,"[Label(name=""api"")]","Periodic syncs and refreshes of the local data need to happen. A working minimum would be to provide a sync button that does a request for all new data (after resolving dirtiness issues), but we need something that can be automatic and efficient.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Main screen UI,"[Label(name=""interface"")]","Not sure what to even show on the main screen, but we need some branding, an icon, and some starting points. Buttons to start browsing are great, but maybe also sync status, item count, user name...
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,cursor hygiene,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""db"")]","Restructuring into activities is causing exceptions due to unclosed cursors. They seem harmless, but should probably be fixed.

ajlyon/zandy,open,Conflict resolution,"[Label(name=""api""), Label(name=""interface"")]",
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Editing creators,"[Label(name=""interface"")]","Make a new CreatorActivity that looks something like ItemDataActivity. Should be passed an item. Single click should do... what? For consistency, long-click should bring up an edit dialog, letting us set the role, first and last name, and field mode.

We also need itemtype-to-role maps to make this work.

Creator reordering should also be possible, but I don't yet know how we should do it.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Item creation and deletion,"[Label(name=""interface"")]","Item creation is vital. We need to make it happen. Like item type editing, this probably means having a copy of the JSON templates available locally. We also need to rework some logic that presupposes that all items have itemKeys at all times-- we need to use dbId more in the local code, so we can work with items before they are saved to the API.

Item creation should be triggered from the menu on the ItemActivity (creating item in the current collection, if collection selected).

[Edited to add deletion.]
"
ajlyon/zandy,open,Item type switching,"[Label(name=""interface"")]","Switching item types is hard to do-- we'll need to cache the item type mappings from the server, and use them to create conversion routines from one type to another, with confirmation when we're going to lose fields. This needs to happen ASAP, since we currently change the item type without changing the available fields. Maybe the conversion logic can be adapted from the Zotero client code.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Tag editing,"[Label(name=""interface"")]","Tag editing needs to be implemented, probably as a separate TagActivity, which is passed an item to show the tags for. One-click to navigate to a view of tagged items (with confirm dialog); long-click to edit tag. Editor obviously needs autocomplete when that happens. Menu on this activity should include New Tag. Delete button can be put on the tag edit dialog.
"
ajlyon/zandy,open,Autocomplete in fields,"[Label(name=""db"")]","The desktop clients offer field autocompletion-- that's something we certainly want to offer at some point. It's pretty important for tags, but actually important in general. Will probably require some restructuring of the way we work with the database.

"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Expose files and other data to other Android apps,"[Label(name=""intents"")]","No idea how this is done, but the app would optimally allow other apps (like annotation apps) to open the files that the zotero app knows how to find. Unfortunately, the API doesn't yet allow file uploads, so the annotations can't be saved this way (yet).

Edited: Bruce mentioned this on zotero-dev as well; it would be good to provide intents for various levels of data to let other pieces of software build off of us, but I don't know where to even start looking for the intents to send.
"
ajlyon/zandy,closed,Transparent switchover between local db and API,"[Label(name=""api""), Label(name=""db"")]","This probably means populating the database in the background, collection-by-collection, or bootstrapped by a real zotero.sqlite (see #1), and augmenting that with API queries for updates (that is, aynch request for updates whenever a user looks at something). Edits can also be made to the local database immediately and queued for commit to the API (asynchronous).
