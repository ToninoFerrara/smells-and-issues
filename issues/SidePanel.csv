sukso96100/SidePanel,open,How to build this with Android Studio?,[],"Hello :)

I want to build your SidePanel and I tried it by importing the SidePanel Folder in Android Studio and then the two other Folders. It can't build. What do I have to do to get it built?

Thank you :)

sukso96100/SidePanel,open,Support for setting up a static list of apps,[],"Feature request

User stories:
As Samsung S-Pen enabled tablet user I am unhappy that built-in Multi Window Tray displays only few applications. I would like to use SidePanel for quick app switching (no MultiWindow needed) and I frequently use a limited number of apps.

As Samsung non S-Pen enabled smartphone user I am unhappy that Multi Window Tray is not available for me.
=>
If SidePanel would allow me to configure a static list of apps displayed in the panel, I could use it for both app switching and app starting (after reboot).

Example of Samsung's GUI is shown at http://www.samsung.com/us/article/tips--tricks-galaxy-note-8-0

There is no need to customize the static app list from the panel itself (as Samsung does), IMO better way would be using SidePanel's settings. This action is usually done only once/seldom.

sukso96100/SidePanel,open,SidePanel should not show itself and the launcher,[],"SidePanel shows itself as a running application, usually on a prominent position. Switching to SidePanel using SidePanel is seldom needed, hiding itself could leave more space for regular apps. The same case is for the launcher - switching to it does nothing and it is displayed all the time.
