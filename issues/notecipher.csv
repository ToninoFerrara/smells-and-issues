guardianproject/notecipher,closed,add forgotten checks for cacheword lock and setting for password change,[],
guardianproject/notecipher,open,security flaw: DoS attack possible by changing password,"[Label(name=""BUG"")]","Reported via email:

Hello,

With regard to your note cipher app, it has a major security flaw which
allows for a major security breach.

Once the app is setup and your password is setup, you can exit out of the
app and re-enter the app as if you were someone who picked up your phone
and launched the app. When opening the app up, it asks for your passphrase.
You can just hit cancel out of that screen and press your native Android
key that displays menu options.

Once you do this, the menu options for the app pop up. One of the options
is to change the passphrase. You can easily choose that option, go through
the process of changing the passphrase and the app will actually change the
passphrase, even though the real master passphrase has never been entered,
thereby locking you out of your own app. Once you try to re-enter with your
initial passphrase (not the one someone else setup) it will not let you
enter.

Obviously, this is a major security breach that needs immediate attention.

Please notify me that you have received this.

Thank you very much.

I made a note store with the version in Google Play, then the current version didn't find it and asked me to set a new passphrase.  Then it was crashy, so I think it was partially detecting the old note store.  I'm using the latest nightly build from today.

Here's how to reproduce:
1. install NoteCipher from Play
2. set passphrase
3. create a couple notes
4. upgrade to this APK: https://guardianproject.info/builds/release-staging/NoteCipher-release.apk
5. start app, (prompts to set passphrase)
