üçâ  I made a quick design draft.

I tried to leave most of the logic as it is. There are two simplifications to make it look a bit clearer.
(no score display for individual words, no space for the word length breakdown so far, both could be added though)

Font: Draft uses [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) that comes with lovely rounded letters and quite a good language support itself but could be replaced with [Noto](http://www.google.com/get/noto/) for unsupported languages.

There's a light and a dark variant. If you play at night the later one might be easier on the eyes.

I opened the lexica opensource android app. After that I clicked on the New game option. And played a game. After that I saved that game. Then I clicked on the preferences option and then I activated show word length breakdown. After that I clicked on the dictionary option and changed the language.

After that went to the homescreen of the app and clicked on restore game option. But suddenly the app crashed. After that whenever I changed the language and clicked on restore game option. App always crashed.

### How to reproduce

* First you need to download the app from fdroid and then install it. After that open the app.

* Click on the new game option and then play a game. After that save it.

* Then click on preferences option. And activate the show word length breakdown option.

I'm sorry to write this here, because this is not related to a real issue of the software... but indeed it's an issue I have.
The point is: how can I select words? All I can do is to swipe through a series of consecutive letters and make that words. But as soon as I lift my finger to move it to a letter that is not ""touching""the previous one, the incomplete word is processed as a try.

of bytes in a unicode string, rather than the number of characters.

Limitation: This excludes any word with a zero width non-joiner (Unicode
character 200C). After a discussion with my Iranian friend, he mentioned
that the simplest solution would be to normalize the dictionary to
include the words with this character, but to exclude the character
itself so that it doesn't end up on the board. This will result in some
words which are broken, but at least they will be able to be shown. In
the best case, we would also unnormalize the words when showing them at
the bottom of the screen and the end of the game. However this will
require a further significant refactoring of the dictionary related code

> For the French, do not use accented letters in the grid and do not consider accented letters to be different from standard ones ( `I` = `√è` = `√é` or `e` = `√©` = `√™` etc.) it makes it impossible, just consider them all to be standard, it would be a much better solution."
lexica/lexica,closed,Feature request: Qu tile option,[],"It would be really nice to have the option to change the Q tiles to Qu, like in the commercial board game Boggle. This would make it much easier to form words containing a Q in English.

Similarly, there is a house rule used in Speed Scrabble whereby a Q tile can optionally have an implicit U. Thus one can spell ""quit"" either QUIT or QIT. This might overcomplicate things, but it has the advantage of making Q's easier to play without eliminating the few words where Q is not followed by U.

I can't comment on the quality of the languages other than English, however the English languages generated using this are not ideal. They include abbreviations (e.g. ""adv"") which doesn't seem suitable. As such, I haven't used `aspell` to regenerate the English dictionaries, preferring to keep the old versions of unknown origin instead.

The end goal however, should be to use a trusted 3rd party source. In my searching, I came across 12dicts, which includes specific word lists designed for word games (http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#3of6game). I think this would be a good starting point, and so we should generate a script which downloads the latest version of this and generates the relevant `dictionary*` files for Lexica.

I have managed to generate boards which include ""greet"" and ""green"" using the UK dictionary and can confirm that they are accepted using that dictionary. I believe that there are more legitimate words missing from the US dictionary that used to be considered correct, but I didn't make note of them at the time as they were more obscure/archaic.

lexica/lexica,closed,Investigate Chinese boards,[],"I'm currently in the process of allowing languages other than English to be played. 

I didn't know which languages to implement first, so I looked at the translations which were provided by the community, and decided to reward those translators by implementing a fully translated version of the game. Some of the first community translations were in Chinese, but I'm unsure if it is meaningful to play this game with a Chinese board.

Unfotunately I don't speak any language other than English, and so I'm looking for feedback on if/how this should be approached.

For the other languages (mostly European), I have:
 * Found a word list (ranging from 100,000-500,000 words from the [GNU `aspell`](http://aspell.net/) program).
 * Go over every word and every character in every word, to figure out which are legal characters to put on the board.
 * Calculate how common each character is so when generating a board, the characters are placed randomly, but proportional to how often they occur in the language.

My questions are:
 * Does it make sense to do this with Chinese text (either simplified or traditional)?
 * If so, is there an open source/freely licensed word list available? `aspell` doesn't support Chinese.

The reason I fear it may not work is because of the way in which each character in Chinese is almost a word in itself, and so there will not be many opportunities to join several characters together. Any feedback on this proposal would be greatly appreciated."

From the source code, it seems that the second column is the probability of the word being added to the board once, the third column is the relative probability of it being added a second time, etc. So for example `Qu` should only ever appear once, `Y` twice, but `S` can appear 6 times.

I'm not sure of how these probabilities were generated, but we need to be able to calculate these for new alphabets too. As such, Lexica needs an algorithm to calculate these probabilities based on how often they appear in the dictionary for the given language.

There is [some literature](https://web.archive.org/web/20150402073213/blog.useost.com/2012/12/30/valett/) on how to calculate Scrabble scores based on letter distributions. Not sure if that is directly applicable here though, because it seems quite specific to scrabble."

-  [ ] Change methods which accept `bool usWord, bool ukWord` to accept a more general abstraction of languages.

Reimplementation of the data structures is taking the most time, as it includes:

-  [ ] Correctly read a compressed `Trie` for a given board configuration instead of the entire dictionary.

I'd propose an option to colorize the letters when only 1/e = 0.368 of the overall time is left.

Only one fraction to make things still comparable.
Rationale for that strange number: if 0.5 were chosen (another reasonable choice) then the quest falls into two equal parts and players might start to (relatively calmly) wait for the convenient help in the second phase (no extra thrill). With markedly less then 0.5 you still wait for the second phase but then as you know it's significantly shorter the thrill does not slacken (end sprint). 1/e is the natural choice below 0.5:)

No soft blend-in on purpose (would be distracting because colors instead of letters would get attention and would be display/environment dependent anyway).

Colorizing green would calm things down too much for my taste, red would be nice but pretty aggressive, grey is not overly inspiring:)

It might be tempting to have the fraction as a tunable but please don't offer it like this (fragments users community and moves attention to tuning the game).

Instead address the need with a button like ""add 60s [to countdown]"".  Use 60 s not 1 min to avoid the vagueness of a minute:)

That button adds the extra emotional aspect of wanting to be helped/not wanting help/little cheating/no cheating to the game. Simultaneously it allows the user to have a valve for stress if he/she wishes to.

Sorry for using imperatives like ""use"" or ""address"" - they helped me to lay out the ideas.
