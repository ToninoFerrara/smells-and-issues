I'm often using [Revolution IRC](https://github.com/MCMrARM/revolution-irc) which channel handling could be useful here to seperate the main barcode view. You could swipe across all different cards with customizable names (#264) until you're at the coupons section. That's a simple scrollable list with customizable notes above.

Of course they often have an expiration date so this is a bit related to #229. I've thought of adding a red color to the barcode which then can deleted by a long press. Maybe a striked out text or something similar would work too.

There is an bug. When I put long note it does not show the card id and the notes are put up under bar code.
I think this should work like that the card ID must be shown every time and the notes must be not shown. I think the best is that every part must have its own place and this cannot be over written. The top part of title should have small place because the picture feature is in the far future and the test should have small place.
The second part bar code must have the begist place.
Teh third part note must have the fixed size and if the text is longer then show it for click or by rolling left or right like it is normal for android itself.

brarcher/loyalty-card-locker,open,Simultaneous usage on two or more devices: thoughts,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","Let's assume I want to keep a cards database shared with my family (say 2 devices for now). Right now, there is one standard possibility:

1. Edit cards on device 1
2. Export on device 1
3. Sync with your favorite file sync software
4. Import on device 2

And then in the reverse order when the database is changed on device 2.

This requires manual actions and in addition the export path is not configurable yet (as described in https://github.com/brarcher/loyalty-card-locker/issues/168) which doesn't allow to use synchronization software which works with folders (you don't want to share the sdcard's entire root where the export .csv file is saved). The latter can be worked around using the ""send to"" button, though.

A better option would be to sync the actual database. But there are a few issues preventing this:

1. The database path cannot be configured. Current path is /data/data/protect.card_locker which means that whatever software is trying to access that location to sync it to other devices, must run with root privileges. Making this path configurable or creating a copy of the database (updated on every change) in a user-accessible location would solve this.

2. The application must implement the reload-on-database-change function in order to load the changes made on the other device and synced back. Or, if we sync the database's copy in /sdcard, load that one when it's changed.

3. Conflict resolution (when two devices edit the databases while no data sync is happening between them). It is the most difficult part implementing which is probably not worth the trouble. Or maybe not? We can probably simply merge cards that are in /data with the updated version from /sdcard thus keeping added cards from both devices. Deletions and edits have to be additionally handled, though. ""Newest change wins"" principle? That will need a new ""datetime changed""  field for each record in the database if it's not there yet.

Then again, cloud sync for those who don't care to set up their own file sync solution? That might be planned for the future. That cloud subscription might (and probably should) be a paid one, earning something in addition to the donations :)"

first of all thanks for this great app.

brarcher/loyalty-card-locker,closed,Shortcuts for under version 7.1,[],"Thanks so much for putting in the widget and responding to my review. It does do exactly what I needed by having a widget that goes to a specific card.

I saw that some people are complaining about the cosmetics of the widget and I have that same problem since I have icon text disabled on my launcher pages in Nova Launcher Prime. But I don't mind a cosmetic issue when it is functional.

However, I do think you can solve the cosmetic issues by allowing a ""shortcut"" to a specific card in lower versions of android. I've used shortcuts in versions 5 and 6 of android and I'm on 6 now. I use the strongswan VPN app that allows shortcuts to a specific profile. Shortcuts would automatically match the text, or have no text if that is set up. Also in Nova you can change launcher icons, so I could manually set a different custom icon for each shortcut.

And finally, if you wanted to publish the intent and data field format of the shortcut here on the github docs then I could have Tasker bring it up automatically whenever I connect to the wifi at the gym which would be very cool.

I'm not sure how difficult it is to enable shortcuts on the lower versions, but I'm hoping it's not a hassle. Thanks again."

In some cases, this helps convincing store clerks that you're actually showing a customer card. It also makes displaying a card prettier (IMHO), since there's a nice image instead of just the barcode.

Additionally, the card overview could show the card front or back instead of just the card name (this is what [mobile pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bluesource.mobilepocket&hl=en) also does. They offer pre-fab pictures for a lot of cards, but you can also take your own photographs).

brarcher/loyalty-card-locker,open,"Improve UX, UI","[Label(name=""help wanted"")]","So, this is a feature request (might possibly work on this myself). My mother has a ton of loyalty cards, so she wants to use an app like this. However the only ones user friendly enough to use are proprietary (her preferred is Stocard). I've introduced her to free software and she wants to stop using proprietary software as much as possible. The problem with this app is that, as opposed to stocard, there are no logos, no searchable stores to easy add cards, you have to choose what form of barcode is the right one, the colours are bland, the list is one big scrolling hell if you have a ton of cards (no searching)

So, to recap, it would be nice to see the following:

* colours
* searching
* directory for know stores, search for one to add it easily (if legally possible with image preloaded in app for known stores, if not make it possible to import these images easily so that they can be loaded from third party not affiliated with this project)
* two panes, one for most used stores (with a tile ui showing the logos with their names on the bottom of the tile), one for an alphabetical list. Maybe a manual pinning of stores too?

Anyways, this is a great app that fills a void on F-Droid, so I'm happy it exists. I hope we'll be able to bring it up to par with the proprietary ones"

brarcher/loyalty-card-locker,open,New feature: Copy the card ID,[],"1. I select the saved card from the initial screen.
2. Now I can see all the details. But I can't copy.
    * I wish I could tap on the card ID and it would copy it.
    * To improve the user feedback, upon copying it should display a message (toaster) saying the id was copied.
    * To increase the discoverability of this feature, a copy icon can be added next to the card id.

This feature is specially useful for airline mileage numbers, or any number that can be used during online purchases.

It might be worth also implementing this ""copy"" feature to the ""Note"" field."
brarcher/loyalty-card-locker,closed,Enhancement: allow editing barcode type (and also the card number),[],"There are some stores that provide a physical card with 1D-barcode, but they also provide the same number as a QR Code in their app (IKEA is one example). Thus, I'd like to be able to change the barcode type without having to re-enter the number.

The UI can behave like this:

1. I click on the item on the app home screen.
2. I click on the `Edit` button.
3. In this screen, the *Card ID* field is disabled. I can't select (which is annoying), and I can't edit (which is also annoying). I'd like to be able to edit it in-place, without having to re-enter from scratch.
4. In the same screen, there could be another button (or a drop-down select box) that would allow me to change the barcode type. That way, I'd be able to change from 1D barcode to a QR code.

Why is this needed? Because I can scan my physical 1D card into the app, but then I can't edit it. If I want to use a different kind (QR Codes are easier to scan, specially if the phone screen is not high-res), I have to manually type the number."

In addition, if the application is to let a user add a thumbnail of the store, namely https://github.com/brarcher/loyalty-card-locker/issues/86, there currently is no place to put the thumbnail.
