It seems like the `Result` instance is never instantiated, but I can't figure out why.

When I run the application in an emulator, I have no problems. The main differences between the emulator and the real device are that the emulator is running ""normal"" android and the aosp calendar app, while the real device is running cyanogenmod with the closed source calendar app shipped with opengapps.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the debugger to stop at or near the place where the exception occurs, so I can't tell you more. Could this have to do with the fact that this isn't a normal app? If you give me some feedback in this regard, I'd be happy to explore it some more.

I am running OwnCloud 7.0.3 under an Apache2 server under Linux openSUSE 13.2. The 'droid is the Nexus 4. (and the Nexus 7). I have tried using the app from both Google PlayStore (v. 1.8.1) and F-droid (v 1.8.10)

     http://192.168.5.2/owncloud/remote.php/caldav/

```
This now returns 
         Invalid server answer, check URL. 
```

In summary of the experimentation: we can find URLs that display the calendar folders
    and show the .ics file contents in a browser (from both the 'droid and the main machine) but for whatever reason the app fails to load them. We have tried both the version from f-droid
    and Google PlayStore.

Initially we had a warning that the configuration file did not have 192.168.5.2 as a trusted client, so we added that. We also added the 'droid address, (and restarted the server: service apache2 restart) but no joy.

So we must conclude that, since the URLs display correctly in the browsers, the application must be at fault.

In my Galaxy Nexus with Android Paranoid 4.4.4 when I choose calendars to be shown in the Calendar app, I can pick a different color for everyone, otherwise for CalDav Sync Adapter I have only a default brown color.

A color picker for CalDav Sync Adapter it's a non-implementable feature related to proprietary Gapps, or we can think about it? :)

Thanks!
"
gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,open,conceptional issue for caldav connections with many available calendars,[],"I see a problem in my case since on my caldav server (Open-Xchange) I have access to many (around 40) shared calendars containing really a lot of data. When I access the caldav tree which contains all those calendars and start to sync it takes almost 24 hours to sync.
After the sync is finished I can turn off the unneeded calendars in the calendar app but all data is already fetched which took a lot of time and likely consumes quite some storage.
So if possible the adapter should first offer a list of available calendars to choose from because all of them are synced.
(Please note that I'm everything but a caldav expert and I'm not sure if that is possible but I've seen it for carddav in another app.)

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,open,Display a shorter name,[],"On android phones (samsung S2 or S4), i can add several calendars to a synology caldav server and they all get synchronised correctly.

But, as the adresse to access to calendar is very long (similar to https://myserver.mydomain.com/shared/calendars/mycalendar.ics), all calendars are listed but i cannot see the end of the adress wich allow to differentiate the calendars.
This is applicable to the accounts list, and the calendar list in the calendar application when i want to create a new event.

So either it would be great to set a ""short display name"" for each calendar, or the app to shorten the address using a few characters at the beginning, then ..., then a few characters at the end.

This is really usability, not cosmetics ;)

1. The current implementation doesn't reset the DIRTY field in DELETED records. so the deleted events appear to remain in the calendar (although they're not visible to the user).  More of an overhead issue since they keep getting deleted each time the method is called.
2. If the local calendar ever gets out of sync with the server such that an event is present locally but has been deleted on the server, attempts to delete it locally won't fully work. This occurs because the call to facade.deleteEvent(...) will fail, so the DIRTY, DELETED event doesn't ever get fully deleted. Same overhead issues as above.

As a result, 15 seconds after the server sent its last reply (KeepAliveTimeout), it terminates the connection and the sync adapter reports the sync error.

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,open,Sync does not finish and eats battery,[],"Hi,

I was wondering why my battery runs down fairly quickly after I installed your syncadapter... Turns out Android shows your Adapter under battery usage (also with a note that it did not follow its own strict mode policy), and when I turn off automatic sync, battery usage is fine again.

In my account settings there is also this ""turning circle"" icon next to where you can turn on/off automatic sync and it never goes away. Also the last sync date always shows NOW-1minute :(

I have looked at it using logcat and also played around by setting ""syncResult.delayUntil = 3600"", to make it wait at least an hour before the next sync, in the onPerformSync method, but it didnt help.

There is also a SmoothCalendar widget on my home screen, showing the next 3 calendar entries and according to logcat it shows that there are updates, but there are none...

In total I have 3 calendar in my owncloud: my default one, birthdays of contacts and a shared one. Even if none of them are changed (remotely) the app keeps syncing forever.

What looks strange to me is the process method in CaldavFacade. You register it on some http request and according to my logcat it gets called fairly often and might trigger the ""forever sync"".

Would be good if a developer could have a quick look on this before I start to reverse engineer the code myself :)

Here is the (anonymized) logcat - Have to attach it in a second message (65000 char limit)

Background info:  I was testing with Radicale last week but it seems that when I leave my house and therefore loose network connectivity the connection hangs as netstat shows the connection still and syncing stops even if I stop Radicale and kill all the hung python processes.   So looking for a different server I found OwnCloud and set it up last night and its working so far other than this error.

I exported my complete calendar from Google and attempted to replace the file Radicale created but never got a full sync to my Android so I found that I could import via Business Calendar on the Android side and sync to my server.  I did the same once I connected to OwnCloud and browsing through OwnCloud it seems to be successful as I see my calendar spanning back many years.

So current setup is OwnCloud 6.0.0a on Slackware 14 x64 server side and CalDav Sync Free Beta v1.8 on the client side and my calendar has ~18,000 events.

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,open,Caldav sync error (general),[],"I use the CalDAVSyncAdapter V1.8 to with ownCloud. After importing an iCal file (google calendar export) into ownCloud, the sync on my phone failed with the message ""Caldav sync error (general)"". Thunderbird calendar and ownCloud-GUI displayed all calendar entries as expected.

Figured out the problem was caused by the time-entries in the *.ics-file, which are full day events and had the same start and end date:
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20131206
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20131206

After deleting the ownCloud calender, manually editing all entries in the *.ics file like:
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20131206
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20131207
and importing it again into ownCloud, CalDAVSyncAdapter syced like a charm.

You could probably argue that it's rather a problem with ownCloud than with CalDAVSyncAdapter, as ownCloud does not seem to check the integrity of the calendar correctly. Anyway this issue report maybe helps someone with similar problems. But perhaps the CalDAVSyncAdapter could also be made more robust regarding inconsistent entries in future versions?

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,open,Duplicating calendars when reading calendar is impossible,[],"I struggled to get caldavsync 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 working with Owncloud 5 on my Galaxy S GT-I9000 with Cyanogenmod 10.2.0. 

Both my own setup and demo.owncloud.org would keep adding the calendar every minute or so (I guess every time the app tries to sync). In a few minutes I end up with lots of duplicate calendars (in calendars to display and -sync). Removing them from the synced calendars is difficult, because they reappear again and again. Besides that I also got multiple ""caldav sync error (general)"" errors.

I found the culprit to be Privacy Guard, a feature in the latest Cyanogenmod builds to finetune control of permissions for apps (I enabled its function to use privacy guard by default for new apps, which is turned off after installation). In the settings for CalDAV Sync Adapter I saw that 'Modify Calendar' was allowed, but 'Reading Calendar' (and a lot of other operations) was blocked.

Tl;dr by allowing 'Reading Calendar' or turning off Privacy Guard for this app errors and forkbombing calendars will disappear. It's working perfectly fine now, with two-way sync.

Obviously you can't do anything about privacy guard. But maybe the duplicating calendars issue is fixable with an extra check somewhere?

I note that the event created on Android has strange ATTENDEE and ORGANIZER fields. If I remove these 2 fields I can move the event in Apple Calendar.

If I edit ORGANIZER to change the email to a real one like `test@xxx.fr` instead of `test@https://www.xxx.fr/davical/caldav.php` then I can move the event.

Who is adding these fields? Android? AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater?

I configured a valid email in my DAViCal application for the test account. Maybe AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater can fetch it and use it for the ORGANIZER field?

This is the XML response which triggers the crash:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><multistatus xmlns='DAV:'>
  <response>
    <href>/calendars/users/oliver/birthdays/</href>
    <status>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</status>
  </response>
</multistatus>
```

So the crash occurs because there is no `mPropStat` object yet, because the `<status>` tag isn't embedded in a `<propstat>` tag at all.

I think the full story is:
- ACSA sends an initial ""PROPFIND /calendars/users/oliver/birthdays/"" request
- DCS responds with an XML message with lots of `<response>` tags (see below)
- the first `<response>` tag is not an event but the calendar itself (!)
- ACSA sends REPORT requests for all `<response>` tags, beginning with ""REPORT /calendars/users/oliver/birthdays/""
- DCS responds with the 404 XML response which then triggers the crash

Here's the beginning of the DCS response to the initial PROPFIND request:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><multistatus xmlns='DAV:'>

""CardDAV-Sync free beta"" which does correctly save CardDav changes to the server. So it appears like a CalDav specific problem. I'm using Android 4.3.

I was testing the sync with Android 4.0.2 and ownCloud 5.0.12. The events from the server are synchronized to Android calendar but as ""whole day events"".
Furthermore, events created in Android are NOT synchronized to the ownCloud server.

Please contact me if you need additional information.

Thanks.

Instead I get the above error displayed in the message area.

I'm using Cyanogenmod 10.0 (Android 4.1), AndroidCalDAVSyncAdapter 1.8 (from F-Droid), and an unknown OwnCloud version (probably 5.0, and I could find it out). Other calendars like Kontact (in KDE) or aCal (on Android) work fine with my account.

Am I the only person with this problem?
Should I provide more information?

I'm really glad I discovered this promising project, and I hope it will work for me soon!

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,closed,Meetings created in in different time zone than your home zone do not get translated to the correct time.,"[Label(name=""outdated version"")]","Using the free version with Zimbra Server at the backend. Used the URL as mentioned on this page:
https://github.com/gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater/wiki
The URL worked fine for sync. All my events on the server show up on the handset.
When I receive an invite from other timezones, Zimbra handles them correctly and translates to my timezone. When the sync happens, I see the event with the start time numerically the same, but in my time zone.
An example:
I am in India - GMT +05:30
I receive an invitation for UK time 09:00.
Zimbra shows it correctly on my server calendar as 13:30 India (with Daylight Savings and all)
Thunderbird syncs with the server calendar and shows it correctly at 13:30
My phone pulls in the event, and shows it as 09:00 India.
Let me know if you need more information.

I've used Caldav at work with 5 calendar. 4 of them work perfectly, and the autosync is working great on them.
The last one is my coworker's one. When I sync it manually I don't meet any problem, but if I activate the autosync on it, it keep syncing for hours, ruining my battery life to finish by telling me ""Can't sync for now, synchronization will be available soon"" on the settings menu.
I also getting this error message after he tries to autosync : ""Couldn't read row 396, col 0 from CursorWindow. Make sure the Cursor is initialized corr..""

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,open,"radicale url needs to specify calendar, if there are mulitple calendars available.",[],"i have two calendars on my radicale server under my user name. (i manually placed them in a user directory under radicale's config directory, and created files with .prop extensions, with some simple contents. it seems like the .prop file has been changed by acal, which i currently use. here is the current file contents of calendar1.ics.prop):

```
{""tag"": ""VCALENDAR"", ""D:displayname"": ""calendar1.ics"", ""{urn:com:morphoss:acal}collection-colour"": ""#004466""}
```

if i use the following urls, then the sync adapter works great (for calendar1, at least. calendar2 doesn't seem to actually sync anthing. i've only tried them both at the same time. that's not the problem i'm addressing with this bug):

```
https://server.org:5232/username/calendar1.ics
https://server.org:5232/username/calendar2.ics
```

however, if i use the following generic url:

```
https://server.org:5232/username/
```

... then first calendar1 shows up in the calendar app's ""calendars to display"" menu right away, and calendar2 gets shows up in that list after a while. (that's fine.) however, when i go to the month view, the week view, or the agenda mode, i don't see my appointments or events. this is the problem i am reporting.

(it's my guess that the url ending in ""username/"" may work with this app if radicale is only serving one calendar under that user name, which may be why it worked for you. note that acal handles this url format fine, finds both calendars, and displays both calendars' events.)

note that for both scenarios, in the calendar app's ""calendars to sync"" menu, i had both calendars selected for syncing. i also had the server's ""sync"" check box selected in the system settings ""accounts"" menu. i use cyanogenmod 10.2 (android 4.3).

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,closed,Event is not eliminated after synchronization,"[Label(name=""outdated version"")]","Hi Gerald,

Thank you for develop this app. In our case it's very useful.

We only have observed a problem:

A user create an event in the calendar application embedded in the Thunderbird or Zimbra Desktop applications. This event is viewed, in the Calendar app, in a smartphone LG Optimus L7 with Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean operating system, running your app. The synchronization works properly.

But if the user who created the event decides to eliminate it, the user with the smartphone can¬¥t see that the appointment is eliminated. In fact, he continues viewing the event although we do a manual synchronization.  Finally, the user with the smartphone have to eliminate this event manually. 

This problem occurs both with future events and past events.

Would it be possible for you to check this problem?

Thank you very much for your time.

``` java
// it is possible that this calendar already exists but the provider failed to find it within isCalendarExist()
// the adapter would try to create a new calendar but the provider fails again to create a new calendar.

I am trying to connect to my owncloud server and tried to use the .../principals/my_user url scheme. However, I always get a ""Invalid server answer, check URL"". Is there an easy way to provide more information?

I tried 1.7 from Android play store and fdroid as well as timonberger's 1.8-alpha build from issue #86. All having the same effect. My phone is a Nexus 4 running cyanogenmod 10.2 nightly (Android 4.3).

If I can provide more help or clues with a compiled version, and it is easy to build this in eclipse, I will clone the git repository and give it a go.

My CalDAV server is the example server from SabreDAV which should also be used in numerous other products. But this is my very first effort in WebDAV and CalDAV. I can open up the URL in my desktop browser but don't know what the correct results would be.

This combination of SabreDAV (stable library but development example) and this Android connector (unstable?) is everything I have, no other clients to test. I don't know on which side the problem is, but ""Unknown error"" is definitely not helpful to find it out.

I've began using your app recently (yesterday) and I've tried to sync with my owncloud instance.
The problem is that it sync only one way: from the server to the android device.
If I modify anything on the server, it work; the reverse operation does not work...
I've been looking my webserver logs (nginx) and I see that it only request changes to the server, the application does not push new changes.
Of course with other devices (thunderbird+lightning) it works fine!
Maybe I forgot something but I doubt cause there aren't a lot of setting ops.
I've not receiving any error (unless it report the error internally and I can't visually see it).
Thanks!

first to say, big thanks for your work, to create a caldav sync adapter :-)
I have a small problem to sync with owncloud.
I could reach the server, but sync nothing from and to it.

Get a Java exception error.

Big thanks for help
Bye

Yahoo doesn't list calendars on PROPFIND in calendar-home-set. Therefore you have to entered the complete Calendar-URL for Yahoo. e.g.:

gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater,closed,No calendars show up with a https self-signed certificat,[],"Hi,
I recently setup a https interface on my owncloud server based on a self-signed certificate.

For testing purpose, I set 2 accounts on my android device. Both with the same username/password but one through http and the other one through https (with a self-signed certificate). The one on http work well (sign-in, show my calendars and sync) but the one on https sign-in but never show me my calendars (and never sync).

I can provide a test account if needed‚Ä¶

Thanks,

   Tried a few CalDAV providers, but the one I actualy need is Communigate Pro server. The URL provided by this server is formed as :
https://server_addres/CalDAV/~username/name_of_the_calendar

Sure you will get it. Keep the good work :)
