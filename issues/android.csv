nextcloud/android,open,Data Loss: Remotely deleting a Folder silently deletes unsynced local files,[],"1) On the Android phone, I added a new subfolder in the NextCloud folder
2) I copied images there which were synced
3) Later, I added some additional images, which, for reasons unknown to me, were not synced. :-/ (The phone was connected to WiFi all the time and it only was a handful of pictures.)
4) Even later, on my Desktop computer which uses the NextCloud Linux Client, I moved the folder with the images somewhere else, out of NextCloud's reach.

Unfortunately, only then I noticed that after moving the folder, it did not contain the images I added in step 3.

As soon as I tried to open the folder on my Android device, it disappeared, and with it apparently the unsynced local images. Ouch!

Curiously, Google Fotos (which I only use because it came preinstalled as the only Gallery app, but I do *not* use its sync/online features) still shows the missing files, but in ""information"" it shows the now non-existent Nextcloud folder as the file location, and I cannot copy or share them in any way any more in the Fotos app. Apparently, Google Fotos uses a local cache which still contains the image file... Does anyone know any way to get them out there quickly before the are really deleted?"

I know that I can select the option in the menu ""Sync"", but working on the cloud means that if I open a file and save it, I want it to be automatically save on the cloud server and not stay on my phone and need a manual sync to get uploaded to the server. If someone else has access to that file, it means that the file will stay on my phone and the other user accessing that file will never get the updated file until I open it again or do a manual sync.

In the settings, I get synchronized but i did not get the file in nextcloud server. I tried this link https://nextcloud.webo.hosting/remote.php/dav/ 
and get message that
""This is the WebDAV interface. It can only be accessed by WebDAV clients such as the Nextcloud desktop sync client.""

Could you tell how to access the calender syncing or suggest a news software freely available."
nextcloud/android,closed,Domains and dynamic IP's,[],"Sorry wrong thread! I'll leave it here if someone wants to test against android too!

I just wanted to suggest a slight change to the PC client app or to make it an option. 

I use a website url to forward all calls to a dynamic IP, Example:
https://mydomain.com/NC/params?*
this server returns a 307 temporary redirect to the current dynamic IP like so:
https://123.123.123.123/NC/params?*


This works fine, except that the Next Cloud pc client remembers the dynamic IP url and not the domain that I entered on setup, so whenever the IP changes I have to delete and setup my user info again.
Can we have it remember the domain entered and not the resolved redirect? (or an option to do so would be awesome for the next app release!)

Thanks, love the program!


### Actual behaviour
- PC app remembers http://123.123.123.123/NC

### Expected behaviour
- it should remember http://myDomain.com/NC
 
### Steps to reproduce
1.  Setup a webserver that forwards all traffic via a 307 redirect to another url/ip. (or ask me to set one up)
2.  Setup a PC client to point to the URL
3. Client saves the redirect, not what was entered.


### Environment data

Nextcloud app version:  Version 2.3.3 (build 1)

Nextcloud server version:   Nextcloud 13.0.5 (updating now)

Server logs shouldn't be needed... you can see the client adding the url. "

nextcloud/android,closed,Add buttons in the notification for twofactor_nextcloud_notification,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello !
I use NickV's twofactor_nextcloud_notification app ever since it was released :)
It is very helpful BUT ...

When I attempt to login, I expectedly get a notification telling me about it.
I then need top open this notification : it opens the Android app and then I have a choice : _Accept_ or _Reject_ the connection, thanks to 2 buttons.

A better solution :
I'd really like to _Approve_ or _Reject_ connection from within the notification, thanks to 2 buttons.
(Messaging app often have 2 buttons in notification : _Reply_ and _Mark as read_)

I initially booked an issue on the app repo (https://github.com/nickv-nextcloud/twofactor_nextcloud_notification/issues/48) but I was told this should be managed by the Android app.

If this F.R. should only be about buttons, please let me know, I'll amend the Issue :)

This makes camera photo backups impossible because you'd need to add a new folder to backup.

### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be awesome if Nextcloud app could recognize DCIM/IMG_* folders and back their content into Camera upload location together with all other photos.

### Describe alternatives you've considered
I can manually move each portrait to the Camera directory, but that sucks."
nextcloud/android,open,Upload existing files,[],"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Setting up auto upload, it shows thumbnails from that folder. I would expect that it would sync everything in the folder... OR have the option to do so. It just seems like something that should be there or that the app should do. Other sync apps do this. 

### Describe the solution you'd like
To be able to sync everything in a folder on my phone. Not just new files. It does this on the linux desktop sync. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered
Manually uploading the files via sftp and doing an occ scan...

nextcloud/android,closed,Android Talk after DNS change,[],"Opened Per Mario feedback via google play
### Actual behaviour
I copied my NC files and DB to a new VM (moved it from 1and1 hosting). Then upgraded from 13 to 14. Talk app would not login, just said ""Redirecting"" and logs shows an invalid login for my user. Web interface worked fine. The Nextcloud app worked just fine. 
The background was intentionally made different so i could tell when DNS switch had started working. Both Android NextCloud Talk and the Next Cloud app showed the new background image. 

### Expected behaviour
It would login. 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Move to a new IP for your NC instance
2. Try to login with Talk
3. Fail

### How I fixed it
Cleared the data and cache on the Talk App. It appeared (after watching network attempts via packet capture) that it had cached the IP of the URL. Once I cleared it's data, it correctly used the new IP.

Seems it should resolve the url to IP on each open.

nextcloud/android,open,Modification times not preserved when loading files from other apps,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
When files are loaded into Nextcloud from another app (Gallery, Camera, browsing for specific filetypes, etc.) their modification times aren't preserved and the files are saved in the Nextcloud server with their upload times as modification times. If files are loaded into Nextcloud by directly browsing the phone's filesystem the modification times are preserved.

### Expected behaviour
Files' modification times should always be preserved and displayed in the Nextcloud web interface and in the apps.

1. open the Nextcloud app and add a file from another app
2. wait for the upload to end 
3. check the file's modification time

nextcloud/android,open,"Automatically exclude certain folders (albums, podcasts, etc.) from auto-upload","[Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I find it very annoying that every time any app I use downloads an image nextcloud will then create an auto upload folder connection. Here are some scenerios where the current behavior is a problem:

1. Sometimes I download an app just to try it out, or use it temporarily and then I uninstall it. But even once I uninstall, that doesn't get rid of the left over auto-upload folder connection. Over time this creates lots and lots of auto-upload folders that are useless and may not even be referencing an existing folder on either local or remote. 
2. Sometimes apps will create folders that have recognizable media that triggers the creation of an auto upload folder but I don't want these folders auto uploaded nor should they be junking up the auto upload folder connection UI. The nextcloud devs can't really predict where some apps devs might choose to stick folders, and it would be bad design if the installation of one unscruplous app could throw the NC UX into disarray. 
For instance, I have a folder where I store Gameboy ROMs for emulation on my phone. Sometimes the ROM distributors will include a small screenshot picture so that the folders will be easier for a human to visually scan in a desktop file manger program. I don't want 65 individual 125kb images each getting their own  auto upload connection and cluttering up the UI. 
Another example, I am subscribed to 137 podcasts, and while I don't listen to them all, all the time, I do have most of them set to auto download the latest episodes when on wifi. If a podcast app chose to cache the album art images to the user's folder then it would be chaos!
3. Sometimes I change my mind about where I want the app to be remotely. In my case, I originally had my camera upload to InstantUploads/Camera on my server. Then I changed my mind and I created a folder called Phone/Camera on my server. I could change the existing auto upload folder, but if I uninstalled and then reinstalled NextCloud it would create 2 auto upload folder connections! One for InstantUpload/Camera and one for Phone/Camera. Very annoying!
4. Sometimes I have a folder that contains many subfolders with media, but I really only need the top layer folder to be identified by the autoupload folder connections. In my case, I have a folder called ""Library"" in which I put audio books on my server that I want to be then synced over to my phone. But the NextCloud client doesn't set up a folder for ""Library"", it sets up an auto upload folder connection for every single book in the library, because every book is in it's own sub folders. The auto upload folder connection is triggered by the presence of album art in the folder. This is also a huge problem for people who might want to sync over their Music Library, which I imagine is a really common use case for the NextCloud android client. 



### Describe the solution you'd like
Currently it is possible to edit folder connections. This is good (though it does not appear to be very persistent as shown by my uninstalling and reinstalling issues mentioned in example 3 above). 

It is also possible to set an auto upload folder connection to inactive. This is also a good feature

 But it should also be possible to delete/hide inactive connections. Doesn't really matter which, it just needs the ability to reduce the amount of extra chaos added to the UI by all the extra crud. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered
I have uninstalled the NextCloud android client and set up a bunch of syncing folders with FolderSync [[link]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full&hl=en_US)

I would prefer to support/use/test the NextCloud client though. The foldersync is not specifically made for NextCloud so it has a more cluttered interface, setting up syncs is less straightforward, and because it relies on a webdav connection the instant sync feature only works when adding or deleting files on the android side of things, and can not work the other way around.

### Additional context
A lot of my issues can be tracked by this previous bug report when I originally thought that this was possible and the difficulty in doing this thing was not by design: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/3161

Also see related feature request issue here https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/3239

This creates a lot of entries in the ""uploads"" sections of the app with the following content:
""IMG_20181028_161552_095.jpg - Lokale Datei nicht gefunden""
The file name of the correctly uploaded motion picture is silghtly different: MVIMG_2018... There is no file in the local photo directory without the MV in front of the filename.

### Expected behaviour
Just ignore the temporary created jpg files.
 
### Steps to reproduce
Settings:
- Only on WIFI: yes
- Only when charging: no
- Use subfolders: yes
- Keep original files: in original folder

nextcloud/android,open,The ability to toggle the automatic creation of auto-upload folders ,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Personally I think it would be a good idea for the user to have the option to toggle off and on the automatic creation of auto-upload folder connections. 



### Describe the solution you'd like
Having the auto addition of folders can be helpful but it can also be annoying. The ability to toggle that behavior off and on would be a good start. 

I think this is a good idea because sometimes users will upload a massive number of media folders, such as a music library and they don't want every single album with album art in it to get it's own connection. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered
I have uninstalled the NextCloud android client and set up a bunch of syncing folders with FolderSync [[link]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full&hl=en_US)

I would prefer to support/use/test the NextCloud client though. The foldersync is not specifically made for NextCloud so it has a more cluttered interface, setting up syncs is less straightforward, and because it relies on a webdav connection the instant sync feature only works when adding or deleting files on the android side of things, and can not work the other way around.


---------------
This request is part of a more general issue I have with the lack of control that the nextcloud android client provides clients in their syncing process. 

A lot of my issues can be tracked by this previous bug report when I originally thought that this was possible and the difficulty in doing this thing was not by design: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/3161

I think it's because `AlphanumComparator().compare(o1, o2);` always returns -1 for identical filenames (at least for files with a '.' in their name) in com.owncloud.android.utils.FileSortOrderByName:84.

Workaround:
`if (o1.getFileName().equals(o2.getFileName())) return 0;` before FileSortOrderByName.java:84"

nextcloud/android,open,Downloading image downloads wrong one,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi,

I'm using Nextcloud in our Company and noticed that when I open a picture(photo, image etc.) it gives me the notice (No resized image available. Download full image? Yes). That's fine, I poke yes and nothing happens. The picture stays blurry. When I go back to view the file-list I see that the picture below has the green dot with white V on it..so it actually downloaded the picture BELOW. Yet I tested that if I open a picture, poke the 3 dots in the top-right corner and download from there it actually downloads the correct one. Could you please fix this small issue :) Thank you very many :)

nextcloud/android,open,Default to IPv6 when both AAAA and A record is returned by resolver,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Normal home internet connection will only be given 1 IPv4 address and use NAT. If there is another service using TCP/443, you will not get another TCP/443 for other service. Since there are no NAT for IPv6, you can open TCP/443 to the Internet on multiple machine without needing to use other port number for port forwarding.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Use IPv6 by default when DNS resolver return both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. Fallback to IPv4 if IPv6 connection does not works.

**Additional context**
Follow the Internet Standard! 
Nextcloud desktop sync client seems to use IPv6 by default, why not do the same for android app?

* Round buttons are defined within Material Design in the ""Crane Design"" see https://material.io/design/material-studies/crane.html
* These ""new"" buttons or rather the different new styles for buttons are implemented via the new `MaterialButton`s which deprecate the existing `AppCompatButton`s, see https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html in general and https://material.io/develop/android/components/material-button/ for API
* To be able to make use of these new implementations we need to move away from the Android Support Libs to the successor AndroidX, which @tobiasKaminsky already started working on here #3089 

* [ ] requires #3089

nextcloud/android,closed,Fix AutoUpload notification,[],"fix #3163 

- fix not working detection of already defined synced folders
- delete not used (and wrong) function

Problem was that passing everything into selection did not worked.
Also this is error prone to sql injection (yes, very theoratical with folder names), but changing it to use correct parameter solves both.

Steps to test:
- have images in camera folder
- make sure that download folder is not in media scanner (delete images from download in gallery app)
- clean installation of app
- set up camera folder
- take image -> no notification
- delete all files in camera folder
- take image -> no notification
- download image e.g. with Firefox --> see notification

I don't want to swipe a hundred times or more just to look at older photos on NC. It's so much swiping! I have thousands of photos, and if I want to back in time, it would be nice to have a ""Scroll bar"" that will accelerate quickly and let me see photos down the list more quickly.

Please, this is a make-or-break feature, it's not a proper photos app without a scroll bar. :(

Once the Lock setting has been set to Device credentials changing it to None has no effect, i.e. the app still requires Device credentials.

### Expected behaviour

When Lock is set to None no credentials should be required to open it.

May seem like a trivial complaint but unless I can disable this I cannot take screenshots of the app.

nextcloud/android,closed,Auto Upload Notification recreation,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Picture is taken
- Nextcloud detects the new picture
- Uploads it
- Deletes the local picture (like it should)
- DCMI folder is empty
- Nextcloud sends a notification that a new upload folder has been found (actual bug)

### Expected behaviour
- There should be no notification about the new folder becuase it is not a new folder.
 
### Steps to reproduce
- Like above in ""Actual behaviour"".

### Comments from me
It is like a nag screen. The good thing is though that in the app no settings are altered. It seems from the outside just like a bug with the notifications.

### Environment data
Android version: 

Device model: Huawei P9 Plus (VIE-L09) & Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950)

Stock or customized system: Huawei with Smart Launcher (5.1 build 048K), Samsung 100% Stock

Nextcloud app version: 3.3.0 on both

Nextcloud server version: 14.0.1 & 14.0.3

### Logs
#### Web server error log
```
Should not be relevant and the timespan is too huge to include everything.
```

#### Nextcloud log (data/nextcloud.log)
```
The log is too long that I can assure that there is no sensetive data in it. From my point of view there are even no current log entrys. I will now empty the log and trigger the bug and look into the new one.

UPDATE: There is no log of any events. Not the successful upload of the picture nor the re-detection notification of the Camera folder. On both phones. The log is blank, not a single entry.

nextcloud/android,closed,Auto upload folders from previous installations won't go away and are creating duplicate folders. ,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
-  I reinstall the app and it creates auto upload folder connections to Instant Upload despite the fact that I have deleted Instant Upload folder and have reinstalled the app so that I could start with fresh auto upload folder connections

### Expected behaviour
-  After a fresh install of the app, I would like to be able to explicitly choose which folders get auto uploaded and where they connect to. 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. I installed the NextCloud phone app last month but my phone was a mess and I didn't have time to do the auto upload settings. 
2. It asked me if I wanted to auto upload to a folder called ""Instant Upload"" so I said yes, and it uploaded some things to that folder. 
3. It didn't upload everything though and when I tried adding things to the Instant Upload folder through the Web UI, I didn't see the changes reflected on my phone.
4. I finally got around to organizing my phone filesystem. 
5. I deleted the Instant Upload folder from my browser web ui
6. I went to update my auto-upload settings. I added some custom folder connections to a new folder called ""Phone"". 
7. A lot of stuff was not syncing between Phone on my server and my actual Phone. 
8. There are also still autoupload folder connnections connected to Instant Upload. I don't want those folders connections anymore but I can see no way to delete them. 
9. I reinstalled the app and confirmed that there were no leftover files from NextCloud app in my android filesystem. 
10. Phone app still shows incorrect auto upload folder connections upon reinstallation etc. (perhaps those settings are being held in a database or something?)

Also I've attached some folders here below. In the process of taking screenshots on my phone in order to explain the issue it actually kickstarted the system and made it recreate the Instant Upload folder. 

I however, still can't delete those connections, and as you can see from the screenshots, it means that I have duplicates of the auto upload folder connections junking stuff up. If there's a way to get rid of these excess connections so I can only have the auto upload folder connections that I want, that would be super helpful.

I used to be able to open all my external apps (NC external apps addon) inside the Nextcloud app internal browser or whatever implementation it is, now after last couple updates in dev version it has changed. Now some of the external apps/urls open in the default Android browser instead of the the app itself.

You might say what difference does it make, well originally it felt like the external apps were integrated since Iw as not leaving the app, now it feels like a bookmark manager more or less. The nice thing was that I put a screen lock to the NC Android app, so all were contained within.

nextcloud/android,open,Hard seperation of client / library,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Currently most of the server manipulation tasks are in serve, but e.g. RestoreTrashbinFileOperation is in client.

This is wrong for multiple reasons
- no other app can use it
- testing library cannot test this operation
- testing on client side is also harder

(I guess that I did this out of lazyness /hide)

So the idea is to have
- in library: all server related tasks, actually manipulation is done here
- in client: call library tasks and parse results

With this, we could (at some point) mock the complete library and test the complete app without any real server/library usage."
nextcloud/android,open,Use dav4android with okhttp3,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This is technically in android-library, but will also affects client.

In longer term we should switch to [Dav4android](https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/dav4android) and okhttp3 (as they also use it).

One of the main benefits will be that the library allows streams.
So imagine that we want to get a list of 50k files, then we do not have to wait until all is downloaded and parse it then, but we can start in parts directly, which will make UX much more convenient.
"
nextcloud/android,closed,Use Lombok,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Please see the video on https://projectlombok.org

It is a compile-time only library, but it helps to avoid lots of boilerplate code, e.g. you do not have to write any getter/setter. Instead you briefly annotate it with ""@getter).
There are lots of other features."

> WorkManager chooses the appropriate way to run your task based on such factors as the device API level and the app state. If WorkManager executes one of your tasks while the app is running, WorkManager can run your task in a new thread in your app's process. If your app is not running, WorkManager chooses an appropriate way to schedule a background task…

In short:
- [separation of concerns](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#separation-of-concerns)
- use Dagger2 for dependency injection (DI)
- use [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)
- use Room
- use LiveData
- use [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
    - to prevent rotation problems
    - avoids async task problems
    - share data between fragments: later usable for split view on tablets

- Network handling: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#addendum
- benefit: get a more easy [testing environment](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#test-components)

nextcloud/android,closed,Show only size of local files when browsing `On device` directories,[],"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

When browsing files `On device`, the size displayed for the directories is still the total size of the directories' contents on the server.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

It would be good to show the total size of _only the files actually present on the device_, for each subdirectory. It would help a lot when trying to clear up local space.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

None."

Previously we tried to find a referenced file in our database and then generated a thumbnail out of it.
Now we rely on the server to get a preview url. This way we can have thumbnails for files we never had in our database before.

### Actual behaviour
- Animated GIFs are still broken!

- Should be playing!
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Install latest 14.0 and upload images.
2. Browse files thru the Android app.

nextcloud/android,open,Filesize threshold for cellular data,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I've setup my camera app (Open Camera) to store raw image files as well as jpgs. I have also setup the Nextcloud app to upload new images even when on cellular data. This works as expected and raw images are uploaded as well. Unfortunately the raws are much larger than the jpgs, thus taking longer to upload over cellular and eating into my data plan.

It would be nice if we could set a filesize limit that can be uploaded via cellular data. It has already been discussed in #486 but I guess a separate issue was never opened about this.

Such a filesize limit would of course be applicable to all kinds of files and would even enable someone to instantly upload small videos, while waiting for wifi for larger videos."
nextcloud/android,open,Android mobile app high background data usage,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behavior
- Tell us what happens
High background data usage of android mobile app. About 150MB per day. When I noticed that couple weeks ago I switched off background data and after few days switched on thinking that Nextcloud might not work properly. As you can see on the chart, until end of the month usage curve did get flat. Now it ramp up again. From the chart it seems that something happened around last week of August and after that data usage started to go up. I remember resetting Davdroid and some other apps in August... 
I am not heavy user of Nextcloud on my mobile, mostly I use Nextcloud News (90%).

Apart from this being very technical wording no one should ever see, tapping a file in this view should open the file view (like viewing the image) inside Nextcloud, no?

Alternatively also the detail view works. But when you upload pictures to share, currently you upload - tap upload notification - get to uploads view - tap file - file opens in local viewer - you can use the share function there …?"

nextcloud/android,open,Notification 'Upload failed',"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- When I take few pictures in a short time,(Let's say 6 pics in ten minutes) my autoupload gives error notification. ""Upload failed. Can't finish action. Server not in use."" (or something like that. my translation) Anyway, pics will be uploaded soon after ~15 minutes automatically. 


### Expected behaviour
- Notification should disappear when it starts trying upload again or at least when everything is uploaded succesfully.

nextcloud/android,open,Auto-Upload issue: Photos taken are not uploaded when no network traffic possible at create time of photos,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Camera app's folder are set to auto-upload. Works mostly stable (have seen a couple of similar issues already open here), but, new for for me, NOT in the following  scenario:

- was off-site, no wifi, and with no mobile data, as no ""credit"" for (prepaid) mobile data. Means that technically devices shows mobile data (4G) connection as established, but no traffic comes through, blocked from telco company.
- I have taken some photos when ""no network"", as described above.
- Nextcloud app ""sees"" network connection established, tries to auto-upload. Forever, no time-out.
-  Even when later again a network connection had been established, NC app shows still no progress on auto-upload notification. Had to kill NC app, finally, to get rid of the ""uploading files ...."" notification.
- NO chance to get these never-uploaded photos auto-uploaded after NC app restart.
-  Even a manually ""forced"" re-scan doesn't detects them, they're not shown as failed, just nothing
- Later taken photos, with ""normal"" network connection, again are auto-uploaded fine, as desired.

### Expected behaviour
- NC app should run in a timeout, or at least be able to detect ""skipped"" files later on, latest with a manual forced re-scan
 
### Steps to reproduce
(already described above)

- Tell us what happens
I uses the autoupload feature and configured it to delete the original file, after upload.
The upload folder is located on a external SD-card. 
The nextcloud storage is located as well on the same SD-card, so access rights should be already granted.
(Didn't try is with internal memory. )

2. Move some file in upload folder
3. Wait until the file is uploaded in the cloud.
4. Original file is not deleted.

nextcloud/android,open,Hard UX on syncing: Confusing words and no documentation,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""design"")]","Android client has: ""Auto upload"", ""Download"", ""Sync"", ""On Device"", ""Set as available offline""... but no explanation at all, and the behavior of those features are not always the expected one.

File syncing can lead to disasters if the user does not clearly understand what is going to happen with hir files.

As far as I know, Nextcloud Android users would like to understand how to set a folder with:
- One-way sync from server to client
- One-way sync from client to server
- Two-way sync

In case that is possible, what about using these standard and accurate words?

In any case, it would be nice to have some Help, maybe just a very simple Readme file on how each feature works, whatever its name is.


Once that is done, it would also be nice to somehow document how sync conflicts are solved.

nextcloud/android,open,User not warned when using an unencrypted server connection. (Add connection security status icon),"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","First, Nextcloud is awesome! Keep up the good work!

### Actual behaviour
When using the Nextcloud app to connect to a Nextcloud server over an unencrypted connection, the user is not warned that the connection is **not** secure. This does not happen at first nor subsequent logins.

### Expected behaviour
When a user attempts to connect to a Nextcloud server over an unencrypted connection, the user should be warned that their connection is not protected/private, and that their data is at risk.
Currently the app **does** display this kind of warning when connecting to a server that has a **self-signed** certificate. So I think it makes sense to also warn when encryption is not in use at all.

One could argue that a user should already know if a server is using encryption based on the connection information they enter, or that Nextcould should never be available over an unencrypted channel, and I would have to agree. But I still think they deserve the warning.

#### UI Suggestion:
Add an icon or some other indication that the connection to the server is secure.
or
Add an icon or some other indication only when the connection is **not** secure. 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Set up Nextcloud, but do not configure encryption (https) on the web server.
2. As admin, set up a new user.
3. Use the Nextcloud Android app to connect to the server and log in for the first time as the new user.
4. Observe that no warning is presented to the user regarding the lack of connection security.
5. After the initial log-in, restart the app to reconnect.
6. Observe that no warning is presented.

nextcloud/android,open,Items added using 'Add to Nextcloud' from the 'On Device' page are not added to the device.,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","First let me say that I have just started using Nextcloud, and it is awesome!
Keep up the good work!

### Actual behaviour
When creating new folders or uploading files from the 'On Device' directory tree, the newly created/uploaded items do not then appear in the current 'On Device' directory. Instead they are created on the server and require you to navigate back out of 'On Device' and locate them in 'All Files' and perform a manual sync. Then the new items are visible from 'On Device'.

### Expected behaviour
If a user performs an 'Upload files' or 'Create new folder' action from an 'On Device' directory, the item should be created on the server (as it currently is) and then synced/pulled down to the device so it is immediately visible/available in the current 'On Device' directory.
I believe this to be the appropriate behavior since the item is being created from 'On Device'. If the user did not want it to be immediately available on the device, I think they would create it from 'All Files'.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Select 'On Device' from the main menu.
2. Push the + button and use 'Upload files' or 'Create new folder' to add content to Nextcloud.
3. Observe that the item does not become visible in the current 'On Device' directory
4. Select 'All Files' from the main menu and navigate to the same directory you were viewing from 'On Device'

- Tap a video, the video player launches but most times fails to show the video, the screen stays black. Sometimes the length of the video is shown, but mostly shows 0:00. Sometimes it shows an error that the built in player is unable to play the video.

Note that 
- if i use the ""Stream with..."" option and have VLC installed, the streaming works via VLC.
- smaller video files seem to have bigger chances to be played.
- even if a video starts succesfully, most times it just freezes after a few seconds (after initial caching?)
- this happens even if the device is on wifi on the same LAN as the NC server

### Expected behaviour
- The video should be played every time. Or, if there are issues, an appropriate message to be shown.

1. Tap a video

nextcloud/android,closed,"Taking a ""Panorama"" Photo destroys Auto-Upload","[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour

Credit to @feutl  for discovering this per his https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/2979#issuecomment-422369040

**Taking a Panorama photo will break the Auto-upload.**

a) Will not upload Panorama photo
b) Will not upload Normal photos taken after Panorama
c) Deleting Panorama seems to make everything OK... (maybe, need confirmation, atleast for me)


### Expected behaviour
- It should Upload the Panorama and not affect future auto-uploads of normal photos.

 
### Steps to reproduce
1.  Take a Normal Picture (Confirm that Auto-Upload works properly)
2.  Take a Panorama Photo
3. See if it appears on Uploads Tab (try Forced Rescan)
----> Panorama does not appear
4. Take a Normal Photo
5. Neither Panorama nor Normal Photo appears on Upload queue tab (even after Forced Re-scan)
6. Delete Panorama, then other Normal photos seem to be detected and uploaded (atleast for me)

nextcloud/android,closed,Feature request -- Port knocking before sync attempt,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","For security reasons I don't like to leave my NextCloud server always exposed on the internet.  Something as simple as a port knocking feature would allow security conscious people to expose their server for a brief period (for new connections) of time after a port knock.

In this scenario, firewall rules allow established connections to pass through just fine.  But new ones would only be permitted for say 10 seconds or 5 minutes on that port number.  [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking)

If I could specify a port knock port number and timeout (in case several shorter lived connections are made by the android app) this would likely be sufficient UI elements.

IMO, this would go a long way towards helping home users more securely host their own nextCloud and reduce the amount of stories we hear on the Internet about non updated versions of nextCloud being hacked."

It would be nice if the shares are flagged as `displayname (conversation)` when listing all the shares, and when you also would allow to create such shares in the client. You can test this easily, by going to an instance with talk installed, create a conversation ""Test room"", go to the files app, open the share sidebar and try to share with ""Test room"". There should be a suggestion `Test room (conversation)`"

nextcloud/android,closed,"The ""Device credentials"" feature doesn't work with fingerprints","[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- If the ""Device credentials"" lock feature is selectedif a device has both passphrase and fingerprint set to unlock, only the passphrase is working to unlock the app.

### Expected behaviour
- If the ""Device credentials"" lock feature is selectedif a device has both passphrase and fingerprint set to unlock, either of these should unlock the app.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Set up both encryption passphrase and fingerprint for unlocking
2. Set ""Device credentials"" in the NC app
3. Close then open the app and only the passphrase unlocks the app

Although the screen that requests the credentials has the fingerprint icon below the passphrase input area and if the sensor is touched this icon turns green but the password is asked again.
BTW for example AndOTP has this same feature and it works correctly with fingerprint too.

At the moment the client has several actions regarding files/folders that trigger downloads and syncs with the server like:
* folders: `sync` (which it seems just downloads a files within the folder)
* files: `download` (which simply downloads the file), `set available offline` (which downloads the file and keeps it in sync with the server)

* and then we have `auto upload` (which uploads new and changed files to the server but doesn't ""sync"" deletions and maybe/probably also shouldn't do that)

I haven't gotten any feedback regarding a use case for ""download and not keep in sync"" while one issue remains that at least from a user perspective `sync`and `download` more or less do the same thing with different names.

@AndyScherzinger and me discussed to split this view into ""user"" and ""link"" via tabs (same like on file detail). Also height should be adjusted to have ~80% of visible space.

nextcloud/android,closed,[3.3.0 RC2] missing avatar fetching,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists""), Label(name=""release candidate"")]",I mentioned it to @tobiasKaminsky already but haven't had the time to create an issue for it. Testing 3.3.0 on my device I realized that the avatars aren't showing up anymore at all (restarts don't change that) and afaik @tobiasKaminsky could also reproduce this with a fresh install on an emulator. So for some reason avatars don't get fetched from the server anymore.

The reason for this: The server for me Nc14 / for a user in the forum Nc 13 (https://help.nextcloud.com/t/sharing-not-possible-teilen-nicht-moglich/36636/6) is replying with the result code 35 with translates to the ordinal value `35`-> `SHARE_FORBIDDEN` and the mData value `Connection could not be established with host 127.0.0.1 [Connection refused #111]`. This might be a server (configuration issue) or a client side change to the interpretation of the server response, that I don't know :/

We have to distinguish two cases:
- first setup e2e on user, then also currently the mnemonic is stored with withespaces
- setup client with existing e2e: this now stores the mnemonic as the user types it.

We cannot automagically split the words, but I guess it is ok if the user gets back what he/she typed in before.

nextcloud/android,open,Use native Android file browser when uploading files within NC,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","When uploading files from within the NC app, it uses a custom file browser (screenshot 1). It would be much nicer if could use the standard file browser in Android (screenshot 2), because then the use can upload from different apps like Google Drive Dropbox, Google Photos etc. This dialog is most other apps use and it is something Android users are used too. 

This gives the user a much wider choice of files to upload, and much easier to find. I think this is way more important than the custom feature of whether to keep the original file or not after upload with the current file browser in NC.

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

*Sourced from [glide's releases](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/releases).*

> ## Glide 4.8.0
> ## Features
> * Multiple `RequestListener`s can be added to a single request (93289994a4ba59c6251aad0ccdf332c0d758d9c7, thanks to Adrian)
> * Added a safer version of Glide's base target methods that force callers to implement `onLoadCleared` and deprecated the unsafe versions. Failing to implement onLoadCleared in 
> a Target can lead to UIs displaying incorrect images, runtime exceptions, or various other [resource re-use errors](http://bumptech.github.io/glide/doc/resourcereuse.html#common-errors) (3a7060777d17fa4d9ca2b68b019fd2d448f54ea6, thanks to azlatin@). 
> 
> ## Bugs
> * HEIF orientation is supported on O MR1 and higher via ExifInterface (a3f8114d015be983d365410fa0655de95fb80fef)
> * Improved error message for network failures ([#2894](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bumptech/glide/issues/2894), ff463d779ef8bccffc224e3647dbaf6dbc27fd57)
> * Placeholder/error/fallback drawable and id variants now replace previous calls to the same method with the other variant. For example, placeholder(Drawable) will replace previous calls to .placeholder(R.id.xyz)(2dccb5c2fb265cbfa67b328cea30e922c67feb9e)
> * Improved synchronization in ModelLoaderRegistry (62e6c11e6e4e4d0cf5f4c380219fe10129bb2694, thanks to [**jnlopar**](https://github.com/jnlopar))
> 
> ## Deprecations
> * Deprecated `SimpleTarget` and `ViewTarget`, see the `CustomViewTarget` description in Features in these release notes for more detail.
> 
> ## Behavior Changes
> * Requests that are started with a paused RequestManager, usually in a paused Activity or Fragment, are immediately paused so that they display a placeholder instead of nothing (a55e935eba859b9ea4f6e4357b8ac4e7e4a8327f) 
> 
> ## Breaking Changes
> * The deprecated `PREFER_ARGB_8888_DISALLOW_HARDWARE ` `DecodeFormat` has been removed. Use `RequestOptions#disallowHardwareConfig()` instead (7eb59f7f217adc7b0e017d586ea0814bf75c53d0)
> * Remove `pause()` and `isPaused()` from the internal `Request` interface (9089752d2a4f4ccd6e7a6a7bbf7ea85db3f0949b) 
> * Glide now uses resource ids (in `CustomViewTarget`) and therefore can no longer be released as a straight jar.
> 
> ## Build Changes
> * Added support for androidx annotations (c3328fe63214c0aedefca3d5496bb222a2fd29ef, thanks to [**colinrtwhite**](https://github.com/colinrtwhite))
> * Updated to Android Gradle 3.1.3. 
> 
> 
> 
> ## Glide 4.7.0
> ## Features
> * Added support for data Uris when they're provided as Uris (17c1c3d5781e953379904a60bae08524632e5053)
> * Improved scrolling performance by optimizing some Glide internal calls (7664c826ef2a55c67a4b55fbe61e33203355f2ee, d7635bda9105dbeb27ed8a3fbda69832396960f5, 7ff3bdeed52d6047e8e9f879ccb3f67afe50fa2d, thanks to paulsowden@)
> * Added support for downsampling in `VideoBitmapDecoder` (97d130d338349220cc8158141bbae1dfda496efe)
> * Provide better default names for annotation generated classes (58bcf53681e8944add93c8680578fa7fdd617785, thanks to [**SUPERCILEX**](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX))
> 
> ## Bugs
> * Improved handling of cancellation in `VolleyStreamFetcher` (a690f38859ebf5f4f06172060596842a35cc16d8) 
> * Improved handling of `TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL` (d939314e04b26709e7e890ba8f88494551111e23, thanks to [**ygnessin**](https://github.com/ygnessin))
> * Avoid delaying the first few requests started in Fragments or Activities by defaulting `RequestManagers` to started when the containing Activity or Fragment is started (7d1898e92600a6a2698d72e12ec26c6715fb8fc5)
> * Fixed failures in annotation processor for classes with `_` in the package name (99723e3e7e14eecd908685da630d522e0e304b40, thanks to [**TWiStErRob**](https://github.com/TWiStErRob))
> * Obey themes when retrieving drawables when the appcompat support library is present (5212e953ff8fb0db390214eafb5a89b826884142, thanks to [**julianostarek**](https://github.com/julianostarek))
> * Fixed a bug that could cause loading another application's launcher icon to fail if the calling application's support library version didn't match exactly (f508d7cce947a8075806e088e798cfb6593647b0)
> * Fixed a bug where a pixel was swapped in the output of `GifDecoder` (7fb8b1258a3aabbedad3b8d15f59c8091498160a, thanks to [**mtopolnik**](https://github.com/mtopolnik))
> 
> ## Behavior Changes
> * VideoBitmapDecoder will now obey `DownsampleStrategy` (97d130d338349220cc8158141bbae1dfda496efe)
> * Preload ahead the first page when using the `RecyclerView` or `ListView` preloader before the user scrolls for the first time (dd7fe186e0eb4ea2b17f8611317a2714b81ff03b, thanks to Anton111111)

- Tell us what happens
After setting up the auto upload folder on my android device (upload on wifi) files do not sync. This is true when the selected folder is either on the phone itself or the SD card

### Expected behaviour
-  Pictures and other data in the folder should sync
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Enable syncing for folder (in my case, DCIM/Camera)
2. Take pictures or fill up folder with content
3. observe nothing being uploaded

nextcloud/android,open,Asks for login info after closing app or not using it for a while.,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Running nextcloud server version: 13.0.6 and latest android app from gplay running on android 8.1.0

After login into the android app. It works as it should but if I minimize it/close it then open it again, it asks for login details again.

nextcloud/android,open,Autoupload options missing when uploading elsewhere,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
Currently, when a number of files are uploaded to NC by Androids share function, it lets you choose which folder to upload them to, and that's it. Meanwhile, autoupload gives some highly useful options such as automatically separating via folder and deleting the files afterwards. These don't exist when uploading manually.

### Expected behaviour
The same options that are available in autoupload (auomatic subfolders, deleting the file afterwards etc) should be available, regardless of which method is used to upload.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Select a ton of photos to upload (because upload pre-existing photos still doesn't work)
2. Choose ""share"" > Nextcloud > NC Folder
3. Have to manually choose separate folders for each photo and manually check which photos were uploaded and manually delete each one instead of having the app do it for you."

Some files may have a very big numerical part. Previously we used long for parsing this number, but this can lead to a NumberFormatException, when we then compared the strings. This wrong handling lead to TimSort error.

The correct way is to use BigInteger, which have no real max value, but are only limited by space/memory.

I also removed the catch clause as this lead to a wrong comparison. It is better to have a crash with a meaningful error, than to hide the error by a strange TimSort error…

Trying to sync files, app tries to download files, stable version fails. Dev version crashes immediately.
I see in the webserver log an attempt to access a webdav file, if I copy/paste the webdav url in a browser, the file gets downloaded without a problem..


### Expected behaviour
App downloads files onto phone's fs.

### Nota Bene
Download/sync used to work a couple of months ago. Changes since then include ubuntu upgrade to 18.04, nc server upgrade to 13.05 and 13.06, app update to 3.2.3.
I cannot pinpoint exactly when this behavior started. But my gut says it is a change in the android file permissions scheme, as ghost commander too is unable to touch any file besides the ones in the download folder.

Now, the app seems to not be able to touch files on the fs. Once sync used to work, I had a bunch of files on my phone's fs. Now, when I delete some of these files in the app, they're still on the fs. Double checked app permissions, has storage read/write permissions.
 
### Steps to reproduce
Install a fresh nc app,
Connect to server,
In app, select a directory you want to sync, tell it to sync,
app 3.2.3 shows notification ""downloading file ..."", but stays at 0%

nextcloud/android,open,Can't edit text files with external app,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","Since Dropbox is effectively [shutting down Linux ](https://linux.slashdot.org/story/18/08/10/2120248/dropbox-is-dropping-support-for-all-linux-file-systems-except-unencrypted-ext4) support, I'm now one of the Dropbox2Nextcloud migrating users.

My main use case with Dropbox has been for years and years to view and edit `.txt` files on shared between my laptop and my mobile phone. Unfortunately this use case it not working for me with Nextcloud Android.



### Actual behavior
External text editors can't open or save a `.txt` file from Nextcloud.  I've tried these following text editor which all works fine with editing text files from Dropbox with. See attached Screenshots at the end of this issue.


* [Quoda](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.henrythompson.quoda)
   * Shows a blank file.
* [TED](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.xgouchet.texteditor)
   * Shows error message 
* SE Text Editor ([Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2&hl=en))
   * The file contents is actually loaded, but saving changes gives errors. 




### Expected behavior
Opening `.txt` files with external text editor apps should work. It should be possible to open them for reading and editing. When saving from external app, Nextcloud should upload the changes (Like Dropbox works) 

 
### Steps to reproduce
1.  Pick a `.txt` in Nextcloud android app which has content inside. 
2. Select ""Open With"" 
3. Select a text editor 
4. Error opening & saving file from external app.

nextcloud/android,open,Selecting auto-upload folders is slow,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- I select auto-upload in the menu
- Screen becomes black, unresponsive
- I finally get the screen to configure each folder

I suppose the issues comes from the several hundreds of mp3 folders, slow to parse.

### Expected behaviour
- No lag when configuring auto-upload

My proposal would be to see the folders with a hierarchical view, with media or not.

- **While browsing in menu** of android app (clickling on menu items 'Alle Dateien' , 'Aktivitäten', etc..)  **the app stopps /freezes after a while !** Then clicking on another menu item (except 'Alle Dateien') has no effect and content will not be updated. In most cases clicking on the menu item 'Alle Dateien' seems to remove this problem for a while and browsing the menu items is possible again with updated content.
But this doesn't last very long !
### Expected behaviour
- clicking on a menu item should always show the right content and switching between menu items should work reliably !

I’m having trouble configuring Proguard. When I run with minifyEnabled false all is fine, but with minifyEnabled true I get lots of Proguard related warnings and error. For example:

com.owncloud.android.lib.common.ExternalLink$$Parcelable: can’t find superclass or interface org.parceler.ParcelWrapper

org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.server.AbstractWebdavServlet: can’t find referenced method ‘int getContentLength()’ in program class org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.WebdavRequest

I can run with disabling the warings , for example
-dontwarn com.owncloud.android.lib.**
etc.
But then the app crashes as soon as a client completes.

I have tried copying the Proguard.cfg settings from the Nextcloud client app on Github, but that does not make a difference.

Any idea how to configure Proguard to make this work?

Nextcloud app was added to ""Unmonitored Apps"" and in ""Optimise Battery Usage"" the app is listed with a gray button (=should be ignored). Power saving mode is on (permanently).

New files do not seem to be detected, ""force rescan"" needed to detect new file. Upload queue items (created through a forced rescan) remain in ""Waiting to exit power save mode"" even when (creating a new file while) charging. 

This might be due to PowerUtils.java only containing a check for PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode without checking if PowerManager.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations is true. I'm not an Android developer, I only googled around a bit.

### Expected behaviour
If the Nextcloud app is whitelisted it should upload while power saving mode is on.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Get a Samsung S7 (only have this device, sorry !)
2. Enable Power Saving mode: go to ""Battery"" -> Set ""Power Saving Mode"" to MID (customised; ensure at least ""Background network usage"" is enabled, rest can all be off)
3. Whitelist attempt 1: go to ""Battery"" -> ""Unmonitored apps"", add ""Nextcloud""
4. Whitelist attempt 2: go to ""Battery"" -> ""Battery Usage"" -> 3 dots -> ""Optimise Battery Usage""; ensure ""All Apps"" are shown; Disable button next to ""Nextcloud""
5. Open Nextcloud (with expert mode on and Screenshot folder autoupload enabled) -> ""Uploads"", Take screenshot => nothing happens
6. ""Force Rescan"" => screenshot will appear in queue with ""Waiting to exit power save mode""

nextcloud/android,open,Theming: StatusBar color in PIN wrong,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Hi there,
this might be a small unintresting bug but to address it and maybe its easy to fix?
The StatusBar in the PIN screen didn't change color according the theme. Does look a littlebit strange with activated fingerprint while the color is changeing from screen to screen(FingerPrint(Themecolor)->PIN(Defaut?Color)->""StartScreen""(ThemeColor))

Would have added some Screenshots but due to Securitylimitations in this two Screens you can't. If needed will provide some Photo's later.

### Expected behaviour
PIN Screen should have the same color in the StatusBar as every other Screen when the color of the Theme is changed.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Activate Pin and Fingerprint
2. Change theme color
3. Start Application and Validate Fingerprint
4. Now in the PIN Screen the Statusbar Color differs
5. After entering the PIN the ""StartScreen"" has the Themecolor Again

Resuming Nextcloud opens into the last app used if a file was opened from Nextcloud.

When opening a file, in my opinion the app used to open the file should be opened in its own task so that when resuming Nextcloud later on, you actually launch into the Nextcloud app itself instead of opening the last used app, which can be pretty confusing.

When changing the auto upload to upload not only on unlimited wifi, the existing files in the upload queue do not upload. Not even tapping the files in the queue can force an upload.

### Expected behaviour
The existing files in the upload queue should upload on any connection when I change the auto upload settings.

nextcloud/android,closed,Contextual menu: unable to know that there are additionnal items,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""design"")]","### Actual behavior
If I choose a file in the ""middle"" of the screen, there is no enough room to display all the items in the  contextual menu ... the problem is that user is not warned that there are additional items below.

### Expected behavior
Suggestion: add something (like 3 dots) to inform user he can scroll to gain access to additional menu items (I don't suggest to display a vertical scroll bar because it is not material design compliant).
Note: below one of the missing item is ""Delete"" / Supprimer.

nextcloud/android,open,AutoUpload does not work on all folders,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Some folders sync successfully using the AutoUpload feature (confirmed setup)
- Images from [seek thermal camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tyriansystems.SeekThermal) are not automatically uploaded.
- The files do not pop up in the upload section of the app, thus they seem not be detected.
- The folder is marked for auto upload but all check boxers are disabled to avoid side effects.

### Expected behaviour
- Some time after the images have been taken they are queued for upload. Further steps depend on state (WiFi?, Error during upload etc).
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Take an image and wait a few minutes/hours. No upload will be tried.

Unfortunately there is no log of the app (is there?) as far as I saw. Further a manual sync from android settings seems not to help. Same when I click on rescan in the app in expert mode.

Adding a text file in the folder to be uploaded using another app (ES file explorer) also did not make the app start syncing anything.

The code fragment(s):
```
GetRemoteActivitiesOperation getRemoteNotificationOperation = 
        new GetRemoteActivitiesOperation(file.getLocalId());
```
and
```
public String getLocalId() {
        return getRemoteId().substring(0, 8).replaceAll(""^0*"", """");
}
```

Which means the remote ID isn't `null` but shorter than 8 characters and likely length zero... 

I know @tobiasKaminsky will argue that we need to find out _why_ it is not set I actually don't care about that too much. The client crashes so even without knowing the root cause of this we should harden the client and simply not fetch the activities if we don't have a remoteId of >=8 characters.

Nevertheless whoever has the time _and_ an idea on how to find out as to why this situation happens, feel free to join forces :)

nextcloud/android,open,"AutoUpload stuck on ""Waiting for Wifi"" when using VPN","[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","Actual behaviour: When VPN is active, and Nextcloud app is set to ""Upload photos on unmetered Wifi"", and (unmetered) wifi is connected, files fail to upload. They remain queued ""waiting for wifi"". 

Expected behaviour: files should upload when unmetered wifi is connected

Steps to reproduce
1. Set photos to AutoUpload when unmetered wifi is available
2. Activate VPN. In my particular case, I use DNS66, which provides ad-blocking without root. It does so by routing all traffic via its own internal DNS-server, blocking known ad-domains. It is able to do so by posing as a VPN to the OS.
3. Photos will not upload, but will remain queued ""waiting for wifi"" forever, until
  - either the VPN service is disconnected/switched off -- at that point, NEW photos will auto-upload as expected;
  - or: the Nextcloud app is allowed to bypass the VPN (in my case, DNS66 has an app exclusion list). In this case too, new photos will auto-upload as expected
 
Environment data: Nokia 7 plus, stock Android 8.1 (July update), unrooted. 
DNS66 installed and running as VPN service.
Newest Nextcloud beta app. Nextcloud server 13.0.4 (other Android clients not using VPN upload to this server without issues)

I should add that I started having this problem about two months ago. I have been using DNS66 for much longer. It appears that Autoupload used to work correctly via VPN in previous Nextcloud app versions, but stopped working due to some recent changes."

I don't know why the delay exists, but Nextcloud android app should, once it knows it is opening the local copy only, immediately do so.  Not pause for 30 seconds, 1 minute.

on desktop, through the WebUI, I'm able to remotely log out any session (i.e. revoke a selected session)

I opened a session at work (I dont take my pro computer home). 
I forget to log out. 
While going home (long trip in train), within the app, I can kill this session (and not forget to do it later from home through the WebUI ... or avoid logging from the android browser device to do so).
By being able to select the specific session I want to kill, when I arrive home, my personal computer is still logged in and I dont need to bother logging in again (which I would have had to do if the feature had logged every session out)

I have set up a directory to auto-upload via advanced settings and set it's original uploaded files to be moved to app folder, those files are now locally deleted.

### Expected behaviour
to have files moved to the app folder after the upload
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. set auto-upload with Original file will be... moved to app folder (by app I presume you mean nextcloud‘s 'storage path')
2. download some big file on WiFi into that folder
3. go offline, try to access the file, to online and comment on this issue.

nextcloud/android,open,"Add ""upload existing""-option to autoupload","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hello guys,

I wondered if there is any reason, why the auto upload is just uploading new files, which from my perspective does not fulfill a good UX. As an example, i recently showed NC to my parents and the first expected behaviour was, that it would automaticially upload the whole folder and new files. 
So that is, why i'd like to suggest to either add an info to the screen, stating that only new files will be uploaded, or add a ""upload existing""-checkbox in the autoupload UI.

I think this could improve the UX on this significantly, because uploading a folder manually is not as easy as the autoupload interface, which seems to be more intuitive.

Just a suggestion, id like to hear your opinions on this,
Keep up the good work 👍

Greetings  "
nextcloud/android,open,Nextcloud keep asking account password,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Tell us what happens
I configured Nextcloud client on my Android (server, username and password). I can transfer files, view pictures with no issues. After a few minutes, I re-open Nextcloud client and the apps ask for the password of the account I setup before. I enter again the password and it won't take the password (I tried at least 10 times and no success)
- Tell us what should happen
 It should not ask for the password once it setup for the first time.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Reinstall Nextcloud
2. Setup server, username and password.
3. Close Nextcloud, wait a few minutes, open the apps and it ask again for the password.

How can i check/debug where the cause for this issue is?

Btw. a small improvement suggestion: wouldn't it be better to load always at first the thumbnail and then the adapted image? So if the adapted image need more time to load you can already see the thumbnail.

nextcloud/android,closed,"TimSort, first fix values, then sort",[],"TimSort is crashing because values (e.g. upload status) is changing while sorting.
Therefore the idea is to ""fix"" these values for sorting.
Drawback is that it can happen that sorting is already outdated, once sorting is done.
But we refresh after each upload and also a manual refresh can be triggered.

This is currently #1 bug on google play console.

For developing, I set each value of OCUpload to random and had a crash on nearly every sorting/refresh.
With this enhancement, I had no crash at all, although every value changed at any time.

We are using these fixedValues only for sorting and read-only.
So a changing status, e.g. because upload failed, will still be reflected on next sort.

- Top left menu button just reads out ""Open"" – should be ""Open sidebar""
- The ""+"" menu FAB is spoken as ""unlabeled button"", should be ""Add or upload""
- In the file list, ""thumbnail"" is spoken, shouldn't be
- In the file list, ""more icon menu"" should be simply ""More menu""
- ~~In the sidebar, the active menu item has ""checked"" prepended (""checked All files""), probably shouldn’t have~~
- ~~In the file list, it reads out ""4 MB, 2 days ago"", but should either say ""4 MB, modified 2 days ago"", or not read it at all?~~

And from @henningoschwald:

- The content descriptions currently are quite visual. For example ""fingerprint icon"", ""shared icon"" or ""activity icon"". I would like to suggest to strip the ""icon"" in this case.
- In the file list, the content description (currently ""shared icon"") should indicate whether a file or folder is currently shared. In case the item is not shared, the content description should be ""share"", if the item is shared, it should be ""shared"".

The file gets refreshed because metadata could have changed.
Somehow then storageManager cannot find it anylonger.
(mWaitingToSend is *not* null, as this would produce an IllegalArgumentException).
So my assumption is that somehow the the remote path is changed and thus the file cannot be found anymore.
--> remoteId stays the same, so it is better to use.

Additionally, I added a null check, so that in doubt nothing happens, but at least also do not crash.

nextcloud/android,closed,Social Login App not allowing to log in,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Using Google login option only (authorized url https://mydomain.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/google)

The Nextcloud instance is being accessed through a web browser (computer) and Android app. Everything works great on the web browser (both computer and Android devices). The Google button is pressed and the user is redirected to the Nextcloud instance.

The problems start when trying to log in using the Android app. The button to login using Google is there as expected after providing the instance to acces. When pressed, it shows a login screen (I would have expected it to use the credentials of the account on the Android device). Once the user logs in, the web page version of Nextcloud is displayed and not the Android frontend. It's like the web page that is being displayed for login is never closed and the user is never really logged in. After about 30 seconds, at the bottom of the screen, the ""go back to old login method"" message shows up. Clicking on it brings the user back to the login page. (An example of this problem #1587 although the cause of the problem is different). If I disable the Google login, the problem disappears.

Is there anybody using the Social Login app on the Android app? I have tested on 4 different devices (HTC 10, Samsun S8, Motorola X Play And Asus ZenPhone 5Q. I haven't tested with the iOS version.

An initial report was posted on the Social App project ([here](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/35) and it was suggested to report it here instead.

### Expected behaviour
To be able to use Social Login's login method to log in to my instance of NextCloud.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Install Social Login app
2. Create OAuth2 Client IDs on Google API Console
 a. Create a new project
 b. Create a new web app
 c. Set ""Authorized redirect URIs"" to https://mydomain.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/google
3. Back in the NextCloud instance, logged in as an Admin, go to Settings -> Social login
4. Under the Google section, provide the App ID and the secret that were created at step 2
5. Set the new user access to a group that doesn't have access to anything
6. From the Android App, provide the instance to connect to on the first screen
7. On the login page, scroll down and select the Google button
8. A Google login will be displayed. Provide Username and Password
9. Redirected to web version of NextCloud (not the Android App) and ""go back to old login method"" message shows up at the bottom of the page after less then a minute which will bring the user back to the initial screen to provide the instance.

nextcloud/android,open,"""Unresponsive App"" error popup when syncing","[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- When manually syncing a large and partially-synced directory, Android O will complain about ""App not responding [Close/Wait/Report]"" after about 5-20 seconds. This does not happen when the process encounters new/modified files early enough, i.e. before the ""unresponsive""-popup occurs. I think, every encountered new/changed file resets some kind of timeout of the popup.
- Even when selecting ""wait"", the Nextcloud app seems to be closed after some moments when not encountering new/changed files (even if there are plenty to be found later down the tree), thus stopping all sync activity. So the wild guess is that Android misinterprets the idle-ness of ""nothing to download"" as ""app is stuck"" and gives up waiting anyways after asking the user once?

### Expected behaviour
- No error popup about unresponsive app when syncing large directories
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Have a large directory tree with mostly un-synced files
2. Tap it -> Menu -> Synchronize
3. wait for error popup

Wouldn't it be better to have the big icon as ""action icon"" and just before ""test"" (user) we show the avatar?

> - And the comment text below should have the same text size as the normal text. We shouldn’t have too many different text sizes as that looks strange.

Currently we have 3 font sizes:
- Date (today, yesterday, monday, May 28)
- ""action"" (new version was created, you changed file, you commented)
- ""value"" (file size, comment text)

--> action and value both in size of ""action""?

> - We can remove the »Today« header – it’s not necessary to show that one. Should only start with »Yesterday«.

This will then also be in activity stream. Is this ok for you?

What about the bold text? Personally I do not like them at all.

do we want to hide the thumbnails, as the user knows which file he is viewing?

nextcloud/android,open,uploaded files are moved to app folder with 0KB and are wiped from local storage,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour

This issue happened on the Fairphone 2 (18.04.1)

I tried to manually upload pictures to nextcloud (auto upload was diabled and never used before on this device).

To my horror all pictures were moved to the app directory and were 0KB in size
They were also uploaded like that.

For whatever reason nextcloud not only deleted but pretty much wiped the pictures of the local storage source folder.

I rooted the phone and tried diskdigger which comes up with none of the missing pictures.

This is a terrible bug when your application to backup your pictures not only does not backup anything but wipes your files beyond repair.
This made me loose all of my holiday pictures and so far no luck in recovering them.

This seems to be somehow related to this issue:
https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/735
where i also commented

It is worth noting that the server might have been out of storage but still that should not wipe the pictures from local storage.

### Expected behaviour
- your pictures should stay on your phone and should be backed up by nextcloud without being destroyed beyond repair.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. get fairphone 2
2. try to upload 300 pictures manually
3. try to find your pictures on the phone

- change the SD Card (incl. Backup)
- all uploads / downloads fails without giving a hint about the cause

### Expected behaviour
- When Changing an SD Card and storage path gets outdated / inaccessible, guide the user by saying ""Storage Folder is not accessible"" to the setting to allow him to move over to a new path
- pause downloads / uploads unless a valid path is set to avoid error notifications

possibly:
- auto-detect a changed SD Card an just ask if we should temporarily ignore this - means pause nextcloud - or if we should notice the swap 
 
PLUS:
- When storage path set is no longer available in selection for new users, give a hint to let user set a new (secure) path (incl. migration << issue https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1048)

### Steps to reproduce
1. existing installation with external external SD Card set as storage path:
`/storage/0381-09EC/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files` (aside that this is too technical https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1088) it is now outdated?! (referring to https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1048) << no Kitakat+ SD Card formatted as internal Storage extension!
3. change the SD Card (possibly user story: change to use a bigger one)
4. uploads  / downloads fail
5. you have to manually find the cause and setting yourself, 

Actually it is even not possible for technical advised users to just select the new SD Card which has a 1:1 copy of the old 
due to the fact, that there are now paths in the selection, that doesn't allow to reuse the copied data on the SD Card (referring to path mentioned in step 1)
** `/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.nextcloud.client` aka internal Storage
** `/storage/B840-C408/Android/media/com.nextcloud.client` aka external Storage / new SD Card
** `/data/user/0/com.nextcloud.client/files` ?!? whatever 
** `/data/emulated/0/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files` (internal again, but path different to option 1 but would match what was set on my previous SD Card)

Beware that I changed the behavior a bit as-in copy to clipboard is now a Toast, not a Snackbar. I checked the behavior for the Android OS and typical (Google) apps and they all show a Toast for this.

@jancborchardt I did change the layout a bit (see screenshots) since aligning the copy icon next to the 3-dot menu seemed strange since shared folders also have the ""edit option"" for link-share so I thought it be better to add a small copy-icon-badge to the text to indicate  it can be clicked and moved the ""send link"" functionality to the link's menu (see screenshot).

nextcloud/android,open,Refactor search,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This is a brainstorming issue.

Currently we have multiple ""search"" functionalities:
- name based search on server (in FileDisplayActivity)
- webdav search (e.g. favorites, shared) via DrawerActivity

Both result in a call to OCFileListFragment and this makes this fragment really huge.

So my idea is to separate this:
- NamedSearchResultFragment, which extends OCFileListFragment
	- get & store search result bound to lifecycle of this fragment
	- if you open enter a folder (which is a search result), go back, you will get back to the search result list
	- clicking back on search result list opens up root of server file list
- FixedSearchResultFragment, which extends NamedSearchResultFragment
	- no search view at all

Additionally searchView in FileDisplayActivity should just call the new fragments, if a search was entered, but not be responsible for anything else.

We can then easily swap/exchange the fragments, and all fragments have a (hopefully) more lightweight lifecycle.

nextcloud/android,open,"Add support for WLAN SSID, only use WLAN","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Automatic file upload & contacts backup does fail because I am not in my home WLAN, or I am not in WLAN at all.
- Please note that I can only access my Nextcloud instance when I am at home, it is not public available
### Expected behaviour
- Only use the backup and the automatic file upload when I am connected to a WLAN, and please add a function (as you can see in FileSync for example) to limit the upload to one or multiple specific WLAN SSIDs. So I can make sure that there are no tries when I am connected elsewhere.
- Use preferred timeslots to queue the upload/backup to a specific window (like daily at 6pm, or on every Sunday)
 
If anything is unclear or if this should be spillted into two tickets, please lemme know ;)

nextcloud/android,open,deleting files on tab 'Auf dem Gerät' deletes also files on nextcloud instance,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Having an 'auto-upload' folder defined which I have choosen to 'syncronize'. The result was, that the folder appeared on `Auf dem Gerät` on my smartphone. I didn't wanted to have those files **twice or double** ...
- one in the **original folder** e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/ProgramData` (which is uploaded to /OnePlus2/ProgramData)
- and the **sync** in `/storage/emulated/0/nextcloud/OnePlus2/ProgramData`

so I decided to delete the local sync `OnePlus2` which is shown under tab `Auf dem Gerät` ... but also `/OnePlus2` folder on my nextcloud instance was deleted

### Expected behaviour
From my point of view **only** the **local sync** of files should be deleted when deleting files on the tab `Auf dem Gerät` on your smartphone and **NOT** the **source** on the nextcloud instance ...
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. sync files from nextcloud that they will be downloaded from your nextcloud instance to your device
2. select 'Auf dem Gerät' to see the local synced of files
3. delete the sysnced folder in the tab 'Auf dem Gerät'
 ... before you try enable the usage of Trash on your nextcloud that you can restore deleted files.

nextcloud/android,open,Enhance error message when failing to sync file due to illegal filename,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I accidentally had a directory in my nextcloud which contained a colon in its filename, e.g. `tro:lol`. Btw, this is totally legal in unix and I think in OSX, aswell.

When trying to sync the folder (to the fat32 sdcard) with the android client, i get an error message.

### Actual behaviour
- A notification is sent: 
```
Download failed
Could not download tro:lol
```

In case a directory contains a colon, the dir including it's content does not sync.
In case a file contains the colon, the file is not synced.

### Expected behaviour
- As far as I know the sync to external SD card can't work because on fat32, `:` is a reserved char. The error message should be more specific, e.g.:
```
Download failed
Could not download tro:lol : Illegal filename
```
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Create files on workstation in synced nextcloud folder: `mkdir tro:lol; cd tro:lol; touch 1 2 3`
2. wait till on server
3. in Android app, select the three dots of the `tro:lol` entry and select `Sync`.

nextcloud/android,open,Application Crash Upon Loading Large Folder,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
When opening a large folder (~1.5GB) on the Android NextCloud application on my phone, the application will load for a couple seconds, then crash. After this, subsequent attempts to access the folder result in an instant force close. This folder has 268 files, all audio files. All other folders work, including folders with more files. Removing a few files from the folder solves the issue, so I believe the issue has something to do with the amount of data stored in the folder rather than the number of files. I can view the folder just fine on desktop.

The folder on my NextCloud instance is Audio/Unsorted

### Attempted Solutions/Debugging

1. Cleared data and cache for application.
2. Reinstalled application.
3. Recreated folder by downloading all data from original folder and re-uploading it into a new folder.
4. Tried a different phone, a Huawei Honor 5X KIW-L24 (same version of NextCloud app).
5. Tried a different NextCloud instance (same version) being run on a different server with the same folder contents.
6. Deleted roughly 50 megabytes of data from the folder, which stopped the crashing.

### Expected behaviour
The folder should load normally.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open NextCloud application
2. Log into server
3. Navigate to a folder with a large amount of data (~1.5GB or more)

nextcloud/android,closed,Display application password / token as QR Code,[],"### Actual behaviour
Authenticating via an app password (or 'token') is complicated because of the length of the generated app passwords : you have to type it with the smartphone's tiny keyboard.

### Expected behaviour
- When connecting with an app password, allow : 
  - from the web interface to display it as a QR code
  - to scan this QR code from the mobile app to fill the field without typing
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Add a connection through the app
2. Choose 'login with app password' (or whatever label in english)
3. Try to type the password you got from the web interface

Authenticating via an app password (or 'token', don't know how it's called in english, french translation is not consistent between the server and the app) is complicated because of the length of the generated app passwords : you have to type it with the smartphone's tiny keyboard and it's hidden.

### Expected behaviour
- The app password is very long and complicated to type on a phone so it should not be hidden or there should be a button to reveal it so I can check that I've not mistyped it.

WiP for #2485 and collab with @tobiasKaminsky for adding commenting.

This PR/branch stack on top of ```fileDetails-3``` until that one has been merged.

**TODOs**:
* [x] add comment box UI
* [ ] send new comments to server (right away)
* [ ] update activities list after comment has been send to server (async)
* [ ] update activities list after comment could not be saved on server (error handling)

My idea behind the described to dos is to update the UI right away while reverting that in case the server couldn't store the comment. For starters I guess it'd be fine if it works synchronously to have it working and then improve upon that.

@tobiasKaminsky would you fancy taking on the part of client/server communication? :heart: "

What do you think @tobiasKaminsky ? I'd say we should harden it in the way that it'll fallback to the color in the xml file but not crash in any case."

nextcloud/android,closed,Auto upload On device directory,[],I would like to sync the On device directory an I guess it works as follows: I activate the Expert mode and then set up Auto upload to sync the Local directory $STORAGEPATH/nextcloud/$USER/ with the root Remote directory. My expectation is that after that every change I make in that directory will be synced with the server while only the files selected in the client are downloaded. I did not try this up till now because I am not sure if I am really right about how this works. So can anyone tell me if it is safe to set up the client this way and if it will work as I expect?

nextcloud/android,closed,Disable Google Analytics introduced by Firebase,[],"Since you have introduced Firebase, you might need to explicitly disable Google Analytics (https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/). :-)



The instruction https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/android/start/ actually says:
> Getting started with Analytics is easy. **Just add the Firebase SDK to your new or existing app, and data collection begins automatically**

> Analytics automatically logs some events and user properties; **you don't need to add any code to enable them.** 


**So how can you disable the Analytics?** 


If you have a look at https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#available_libraries it says that the `firebase-core` library corresponds to the Analytics part of FireBase. 
The `firebase-core` is pulled in as a dependency automatically once you add the Firebase SDK to you project.

Hence you would like to remove it:
```configurations.all {
exclude group: 'com.google.firebase', module: 'firebase-core'
}
```


The official guide to disable Analytics does not tell you about this solution (or at least it's pretty good hidden) and suggests another:

> **Permanently deactivate collection**
> 
> If you need to deactivate Analytics collection permanently in a version of your app, set firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated to true in your app's AndroidManifest.xml in the application tag. For example:
> 
> `<meta-data android:name=""firebase_analytics_collection_deactivated"" android:value=""true"" />`
> 
> **Disable Advertising ID collection**
> y
> If you wish to disable collection of the Advertising ID in your Android app, you can set the value of google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled to false in your app's AndroidManifest.xml in the application tag. For example:
> 
>` <meta-data android:name=""google_analytics_adid_collection_enabled"" android:value=""false"" />`
>

nextcloud/android,open,Automatically switch to grid view for folders that contain only files of type media,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
With Nextcloud I started to share quite a lot of my photos. Others upload photos as well. So I start having more and more folders filled with photos. As there are close to non open source webdav based gallery apps out there, the Nextcloud for android gets my primary photo gallery app. But it still has a drawback. I manually have to switch folders to grid view even there are no other files than photos. The grid view is by far the best view to watch photos. Other file functions are (luckily) also available in this view.

### Expected behaviour
The Nextcloud android app checks the type of all files that should be displayed in the current folder. If all files are from type ""media"", switch to the grid view automatically. Also nice: for someone who doesnt like this smart detection, an option in settings could prevent it.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Create a folder on the server
2. Upload only fotos
3. Navigate in the android app to this folder
4. Check if the folder is open in grid view

Crashing line:
```
charging = charging || Device.getBatteryStatus(context).getBatteryPercent() == 1;
```
to then do afterwards
```
if (!isPowerSaving && gotNetwork && checkIfUploadCanBeRetried(failedUpload, gotWifi, charging)) {
   retry(context, currentAccount, failedUpload);
 }
```

So a simple solution is to have a try/catch for the IllegalArgumentException - we only need to decide if we then ""just"" use whatever value charging had before or if we explicitely just retry / not retry in case of an exception.

nextcloud/android,open,Add possibility to navigate in folder hierarchie,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
Navigating in deep folder structures is a bit frustrating, because I keep clicking the ""back"" (arrow) button. Clickling one of the navigation element in the left swipe menu sends me strictly to the root dir and is not really a help to reach folders in between.

### Expected behaviour
The current folder title is a button. When I click the button, it shows me the folder path / structure as a list representing the folder hierarchie. Alternatively longpressing the backbutton is fine too, but the folder title as button would be faster in usability.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Create a deep folder structure on server
2. Navigate to the last element in the hierarchie
3. Try to navigate back to a folder of choice

The App uploads the file / picture / contact to 100%, but then gets stuck with full progress bar. When I check via webinterface the file is there.
After the upload ran into an timeout, i get the message an error occured. But a few seconds later it tries again and would run in the same issue.

nextcloud/android,open,Destroyed file due to failed opening of .ipf file,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I tried to oben a igor procedure file on my smartphone. Since the format is not supported by any app i then tried to copy it to another folder, change the ending to .txt and then open it (which did not work). I then deleted the copied version. The next day when syncing with a nextcloud desktop client i saw, that the original file was broken, meaning having 0kb of size and being empty. Restoring a previous version did save the file, but it seems opening unsupported datatypes can destroy files.

### Expected behaviour
I expected to file to be opened as a txt file, since it is simply a plane text file of code with a different file ending.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. upload an igor procedure file (.ipf)
2.  try to open in adroid app
3. copy
4. rename copy
5. delete copy
6. sync original file to desktop by client

nextcloud/android,open,Renaming of offline files ,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- When an ""offline"" file is renamed on the server, the app detects it as a completely new file. The ""old"" file is deleted from the cache, and a ""new"" file appears on the device (in the app) and must be downloaded again 

### Expected behaviour
- The app should be able to detect that the file has just been renamed (or moved) and update its cache without re-downloading the file.
This probably requires some metadata-communication-channel between the server and the app, where the app can fetch a list of file-operations (moving, deleting etc) without basing sync solely on the file-list from the server.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Set a file as ""Available offline"" in the Android App
2. File is downloaded and cached locally on the device
3. Rename the file on the server (using the WEB UI or whatever other method - NOT the app)
4. Notice how the ""new"" file is not cached on the device

nextcloud/android,open,Deleted shares can not be reactivated,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Need server-side: nextcloud/server#2192

### Actual behaviour
If you -deliberately or by accident- delete a share (folder or file) shared to you as read only in the Android app no option to reactivate/reinstantiate the folder is available to the user to whom the entity was shared.
The event of sharing the object is still visible in the activity protocol but clicking on the link fails.
The only option to get the shared object back is to revoke the share as sharing user and share again.

### Expected behaviour
It should be possible to reinstantiate the shared folder, e.g. via activity protocol or a special menu within settings.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Let user A share a folder with user B or a group user B belongs to with read only permissions
2. Log in user B to the Android client
3. User B deletes the shared folder in the Android client (I deleted “globally“, not only “local“ but I think it doesn't matter)
4. Open activity screen in Android client and select the (grayed out) deleted share

I'll be happy to look into this. @AndyScherzinger proposed [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView) which looks good to me. I'll see if I can dig up other alternatives too though and play around with them to see what works."

nextcloud/android,closed,case-insensitive filename bug?,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I am seeing what appears to be a bug in the Android client related to filenames. Here is how I reproduce it:

1. Create new folder on my Linux desktop running Mint.
2. Add two files: somefile.pdf and SomeFile.pdf.
3. Open this folder in my NextCloud android client.
4. Tap on of one these to open it. The client downloads and opens it a PDF viewer.
5. Tap on the second file. The client reports a version collision. If I select server version I end up with two versions of the first file, even though the filenames are different. This change is propagated back to the server and the the desktop client.

Somewhere in the app there seems to some filename comparison code which is case-insensitive.

nextcloud/android,closed,"Enable ""Upload option"" when uploading files using share function outside the app",[],"### Actual behaviour
- Shows regular dialog to select folder where to upload the file that is being shared. It just assumes the default ""Upload option"" as ""Keep file in source folder"".

### Expected behaviour
- ""Upload option"" is showed, allowing user to select one of the following when uploading using ""share"" functionality:
** Move file to nextcloud folder
** Keep file in source folder
** Delete file from source folder
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. For example open ""Galery"" with pictures or file browser.
2. Select file/image and click ""share icon"".
3. In the opened dialog ""Share via"" select ""Nextcloud"".
4. The view opened lets you select the folder where to upload the file, but doesn't allow you to select an appropriate ""Upload option"" (one of: Move file to nextcloud folder, Keep file in source folder, Delete file from source folder).

nextcloud/android,open,Nextcloud does not sync when some subfolders are already synced,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","###Actual behaviour

I have all my music synchronized to Nextcloud. This is quite a big folder having 43GB Containing 8835 Files in 776 subfolders (strucutred by artist/album/filename.mp3 if that is important)
Yesterday I started to sync that folder already (see #2559 ) but needed to cancel syncronisation. After restarting it this morning when the display turned black after about half a minute the Syncronisation stopped and Nextcloud got terminated. As far as I could check now this only happens before Nextcloud is downloading new files probably due to the power saving of Android even if I exclude it from Battery Optimisation

###Expected behaviour

Nextcloud should sync in Background and keep the app running until everything is synced

###Steps to reproduce

1.    create a folder containing many subfolders and files below it 
2.    Start Syncing and cancel Syncronisation after more than half n hour
3.    sync the whole folder to Android

I have all my music synchronized to Nextcloud. This is quite a big folder having 43GB Containing 8835 Files in 776 subfolders (strucutred by artist/album/filename.mp3 if that is important)
Now when i want to Sync that folder to my Phone. I get the message Nextcloud not responding from Android. While I still see incoming requests from the app to Apache on the access.log and also notifications that files are downloaded.

@nextcloud/designers I am currently implementing trashbin view into android.
Web UI has only ""delete"" on overflow menu (three dots), which is a bit uncommon for me, if there is only one menu item. Is it okay to have the delete button directly next to restore?

nextcloud/android,open,Incorrect filenames sharing files to the Nextcloud app due to different Android versions / file managers,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug"")]","filed here after having discussed with @jospoortvliet 

### Actual behaviour
I use two different HUAWEI phones. On my newer phone I notice - since at least many months - a strange behaviour when I upload a file via the ""share"" function inside the Huawei filemanager: the original filename e.g. ```test.test``` or ```1.1``` or ```00001.vcf``` is not transported to the Nextcloud server directory, intead a plain number like ```101663``` is shown, the file and filesize appears to be intact.

The filename is preserved when I ""upload"" a jpeg file via the share function.

### Expected behaviour
I expect that the correct filename is used and transported to the server directory.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Start the Filemanager, navigate to an internal or SD card directory
2. Rename a ```file.jpg``` to ```1.1``` (or create a file with that name)  
3. Long-click the file and select ""Weitergeben"" (~ share) in the ""Mehr"" (""more"") context menu
4. Select to share with the ""Nextcloud"" app
5. Navigate to a suited Nextcloud directory and start the upload to there.
6. Nextcloud closes and the upload starts
7. Re-open Nextcloud and notice, that the filename is now something like ```101663``` instead of ```1.1``` in the example.

### Environment data

A few minutes later the folder was deleted (the nextcloud media folder is present on the sd card, but no sub folders) and any other attempts to sync a folder fails.  In the nextcloud android app the folder is still listed as on my device.  

### Expected behaviour
- once a folder is synced, the data should be accessible on the android device until deleted.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Sign into NC android app and connect to server
2. Change storage location to sd card
3. Set a folder to synchronize
4. Check android storage location /storage/97F8-F17A/Android/media/com.nextcloud.client and the synced data is present.  Minutes later it is not.

nextcloud/android,open,Malformed Server configuration when sync file after local change,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","I am aware of issue #2227 but this seems to be different

### Actual behaviour
- in the NC app, set a file test.txt to sync
- make some local changes to the file on android device
- NC app will upload the newest version to the server
- upload is successful, BUT the most recent file version remains with .part extension
- app will keep trying and generating .part files on the server
- original file on server test.txt remains as the old version, and multiple .part files are uploaded to the server
- get an error saying Malformed Server configuration
- server logs complain about renaming error
- tested just renaming a file on the server (using android app) and it works OK. 

### Expected behaviour
- file should sync successfully
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. set a remote file to sync
2. edit the file on android device
3.

* [x] remove sharing icon from top menu
* [x] make header transparent, only back arrow visible (for preview-able files), non-preview-able files do not have any icon/preview, so that the first ""row"" is file name (and then we can show again a solid header).

nextcloud/android,closed,[MVP] Refactored the Activities activity,[],"I have refactored the entire Activities List activity.

The old activity class has been split up into a View (Activity) and a Presenter with a Contract interface that connects them. Additionally, I have implemented a repository pattern for all remote data access. Currently I've kept things specific to the Activities screen but it would be possible to use it for all remote data operations throughout the app instead of the various duplicate AsyncTasks and Thread implementations you currently have.

I have added unit tests with a 100% coverage for the Presenter and the Files and Activities repository data classes. Instrumented tests can be written to cover the View. 

Note that when launching the activities screen you will currently see a NullPointerException due to #2502. Applying #2503 fixes the issue it seems.

I've taken some liberties and cleaned up some stuff that just didnt make sense to me. Most notably the multiple ways progress was being shown to the user. I think the SwipeToRefresh-indicator sufficiently indicates  progress to the user so I removed the `emptyContentProgressBar` progress indicator by setting it to Invisible. I also removed the funky way you guys showed the empty content view when no activities are available. You had a separate RecylerView with an associated RecylerView  for empty content to give the user the ability to swipe-to-refresh when no activities where shown in the list. I simplified this by removing the redundant recyclerview all-together by moving the included `empty_list` view into the primary `SwipeRefreshLayout` used for the recyclerView used for actually displaying Activities and simply toggling visibility according to the availability of activities. Looks a lot cleaner to me :) 

Finally, this is still WIP. I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff I've missed and corner cases I havent accounted for. The obvious TODO's I've identified is getting rid of the hardcoded error strings and replace them with string resources. (The old implementation also used hardcoded strings btw). Furthermore, it would be nice to get rid of the Toast messages and replace them with as Snackbar message instead. I saw some discussion somewhere yesterday of doing that globally through the app so I'll leave that up to you guys for now as that can easily be fixed later.

Looking forward to your feedback. Hope this makes sense. There is still room for a lot of cleanup here but at least it's a lot nicer than it was imho."

nextcloud/android,open,Auto-scale icons as per change in column count,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""medium"")]","### Actual behaviour
Currently, the icons do not auto-scale as per the column count, when pinch zoom feature is used. This makes the screen look a bit weird. 

### Expected behaviour
The icons should be auto-scaled as per the column count.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open the All Files activity 
2. Switch to Grid View
3. Pinch Zoom to change the column count to see some weird changes.

This is an enhanced view for images/videos which have a preview:
- no overflow menu on top, but next to filename
- clicking on star toggles favorite
- tags opens up editing
- activity and sharing as ""tabs"" which can be toggled

Activity tab:
- combined activity, comments, versions (endpoint on server side is needed for this, https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/658)
- on top: text input box for commenting

Share tab:

- sharees are sorted by permissions (from max permissions to read only)
- on each sharee there is an overflow menu with its specific sharing permissions

Sharing to a new user/group/link:
- click on text input on share tab hides activity/sharing toggle to have more space for actually searching
- share link as entry beneath search field
	- with ""can edit"" 
	- click on it opens up existing app chooser to receive link
- during input we show the list of results

nextcloud/android,open,[Suggestion] Migrate to MVP,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","The current codebase is a bit difficult to work with in my opinion. Unit testing is especially difficult and it doesnt seem like a testable design architecture is being used. There are about a gazillion different architectures and patterns out there and while I have by no means tested them all I find that MVP is easy to understand and test. Additionally, you could consider something like the repository pattern for easier API development.

I'll be happy to create PR with a proposed MVP example. I havent been able to find the easiest place to start as it's pretty time consuming trying to wrap my head around the various bits and pieces related to an isolated activity and/or view.

Migrating to a cleaner architecture means we can actually write effective unit tests for the application. MVP would make it trivial to write unit tests for the presenter and instrumented tests for the view for full code coverage.

Assuming server requires VPN to work, isInternetWalled returns wrong value:
If the device is connected without VPN and not using WiFi: isOnlineWithWifi returns false, Device.getNetworkType returns != ANY and as a consequence isInternetWalled returns false, this in turn allows synch jobs to start even if server is not reachable.

This is a bug fix for the recycler view header design.

I'd also even vote to include this in the 3.1.0 release since this restores the design we had in 3.0.x and this way we don't create a UI regression bug... But I leave that up to you guys."

nextcloud/android,closed,Added a splash screen,"[Label(name=""design"")]","Resolves #2444

Added a splash screen. This is done by defining a launch screen theme with an associated XML resource that configures the appearance. Then we associate the launch screen theme with the launcher activity (`FileDisplayActivity`) in the manifest. Finally, we set the default theme in `onCreate()` before super in `FileDisplayActivity` so that it's applied when the activity is ready to the view is set. 

This approach is better than implementing the launch screen as a separate activity since we dont get the negative performance impact of adding an additional activity transition every time the app is started.

I used the default logo drawable which I think looks fine but I'm sure the designers should chime in and give their input. Screenshot is attached.

- Tell us what happens

I have Nextcloud configured to upload photos if i am connected to wifi and the phone is charging. I use an always-on VPN when im not on my home wifi.
If i am somewhere else and i have wifi connection, phone is charging and the VPN is connected ( workplace etc) Nextcloud does not upload photos and videos, it lists the files but in the ""waiting for wifi"" state.
It works as expected if i connect only to wifi.

### Expected behaviour
- Tell us what should happen
 When i connect to a wifi regardless if have a VPN connected or not, it should upload photos and videos.

1. Set Nextcloud to upload photos/videos on wifi+charge
2. Connect to an always-on VPN (restrictive, all traffic redirected through it)
3. Take some pics/videos, connect to wifi, put the phone to charge

Also if you press the Messages button and the file is extremely large as my file is 646.7MB this would cause issues in the sending the actual files, I feel that Nextcloud app should have some kind of limit to prevent the user from inadvertently causing themselves issues when sending files too large.

nextcloud/android,open,Metadata corruption after uploading files to encrypted folder,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""bug"")]","Originally posted in end-to-end repo, where it was suggested I post here instead.
https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption/issues/73

Server: Nextcloud 3.0.1
End-to-End Encryption App: 1.0.5
Client: Nextcloud Dev (Android, F-Droid) v20180330

I created an encrypted Music folder via the Android client and tried to upload about 100 music files. After a certain point, every upload began to fail. I looked in the folder and the filenames are a series of hex characters (encrypted).

To test, I also created a folder of 200 tiny text files using:
`for i in $(seq 1001 1200); do echo $i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i$i > garbage$i.txt; done`
I tried to upload these to a new encrypted folder called ""garbagetest"". Problem was the same as with the music. Uploads began to fail after uploading 11 of them, and as expected, metadata was lost. (The number of files it takes for failure to begin varies.)

For the test, when problems began, Android's logcat showed:

nextcloud/android,closed,Fingerprint lock can be easily bypassed,[],"# Summary

It's fairly easy to bypass the fingerprint lock. By simply backing out of the app without actually killing the app the user would not be prompted for a fingerprint when returning to the app.

# How to reproduce

1. Enable fingerprint lock
2. Open the app, unlock with fingerprint
3. Click the back button on the Android nav bar.
4. Open the Nextcloud app again. No fingerprint auth occurs.

# Proposed fix

I haven't looked at the relevant code yet but I'd assume that the fingerprint auth should be fired in ```onResume()```. I'll look into it if nobody has a clear answer."

nextcloud/android,open,Client app doesn't (reliably) work on WiFi but works over 3g/4g,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour

Nextcloud fails to download, refresh files list, or sync at all over Wifi. It works fine over mobile data however.

A further weird thing is that if you disable WiFi, sync Nextcloud, then turn WiFi back on, and then try to upload/download a file then it will work over WiFi (until it doesn't again).

### Expected behaviour

Nextcloud should work fine both on WiFi and on mobile data.
 
### Steps to reproduce

1. Turn on WiFi
2. Try to download/sync a file in Nextcloud

It might be related that I have a home WiFi where the server is on my internal network, whereas it will have another IP-address on other WiFi-networks. On my home network the domain name will resolve to `192.168.1.17` while externally the router will proxy the connection between the two.

The app synchronizes over mobile data per default WITHOUT a warning or asking about it even once - that's bad since traffic-limited plans (with either significantly degraded functionality or highly increased cost after exceeding the overall traffic volume) are still the norm for many European countries, and I assume also most of the US.

### Expected behaviour
Sync over wifi only, or make a big(!) popup at the start that warns me about this default setting of syncing over data and offer an obvious button to turn that off.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Install & open nextcloud app
2. Login to a cloud
3. Choose an existing folder on the server with existing content on the server (a non-trivial amount of files), which isn't present / synchronized to the phone storage yet. Click the ""Sync"" button from the folder menu on the right. The app should now start downloading things to the phone storage
4. Get out of wifi range with mobile data enabled, and observe that synchronization / downloading will continue

can you also adjust the layout/whitespace according to the screenshot I posted above?
- More spacing above and below the top header
- As mentioned, top header could be better in non-bold to not fight with the feature header
- Less space between feature header and feature detail text

nextcloud/android,open,android - locally generated files in favourite folders not synced,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- files (and folders) locally copied into a favourite folder by apps other than the nextcloud client are not detected by the sync client and thus not uploaded onto the server 

### Expected behaviour
- locally copied files onto favourite folders should be synced
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Mark a folder as favorite through the Android client e.g. files/test/
2. Locate the folder in the phone local storage, e.g. storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.nextcloud.client/nextcloud/user@server/files/test/
3. Copy a new file (e.g. newfile.txt) via another app (e.g. file browser) into the folder in point 2
4. With the nextcloud Android client, sync the folder previously marked as favourite. newfile.txt does not show up. 

### Environment data
Android version:  7.0

Device model: Motorola G4 Plus

Stock or customized system: stock

Nextcloud app version: 3.03

Nextcloud server version: 13

nextcloud/android,closed,Feature Request: AutoUpload Custom Folder modification,[],"The current Nextcloud Android App UI let's me add Custom Auto-Upload folders. That's very nice.
It also let's me modify the remote folder and a few other settings, but it does not allow me to modify the local folder that I want to sync.

The use case I have right now: I configured a folder of the App Gadgetbridge to be Auto-Uploaded because I want its Database backups on my NAS. But Gadgetbridge also writes Logfiles, and I'd like to either only upload those at the end of the day when they are zipped, or not at all.

For the first variant, I would need to somehow specify which files inside a folder should be uploaded or ignored. A pattern field for that would be good (white-list and or black-list would be nice).

The second solution, to not upload the logfiles of that app at all, is a fix I could do right now by deleting the custom folder config and adding a different one that only includes the database export folder without the logfiles folder. But it would be nicer and less effort on the user's part to be able to modify the config without deleting and recreating it."
nextcloud/android,closed,"Favorites, Photos and Search not working when using LDAP authentication",[],"### Actual behaviour
This might be related to https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1257 but I have only seen closed tickets there. But maybe I am missing something ...

My android app does not allow my to see my favorites and photos. What I see instead is an endless ""Loading ..."" message. Same for the search.

### Expected behaviour
See the same content when using the web application, which has no issues here.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Setup nextcloud for LDAP authentication
2. Install Android app and provide credentials
3. Open Favorites or Photos from the sliding menu or try to search for a file

### Environment data
Android version: 8.1.0

Device model: Pixel 2 (also tested on other Android phones/tablets, no issues on iphone 7)

Stock or customized system: stock

Nextcloud app version: 3.0.3 (also observed with previous builds)

Nextcloud server version: 13.0.1 (also observed with previous builds)

nextcloud/android,closed,Can not log in with the Android application,[],"### Actual behaviour
When credentials are typed and I type ""log in"" window dessapers and nothing happens. Also if I type incorrect credentials, it is error password attention.

### Expected behaviour
After tapping ""log in"" with propper username and password Nextcloud app  window should be opened and new account should exists.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Log in in the NC application.
2. Switch down the NC server for some time. (I am not sure that it is actually necessary step, but at last time I marked that trouble happened after my server's reboot).
3. NC app loses setted account.
4. Now it is impossible to log in again.

One time I supposed that there is some incorrect redirect in my phone memory (some time ago I changed the domain name). So I purged nextcloud and all browsers data, but it did not help. Then I make factory reset and for some time application workd find until server's reboot.

nextcloud/android,open,Andoird end-to-end encryption having issues after upgrade,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I have recently upgraded from 13.0.0 to 13.0.1 and now I cannot seem to upload to encrypted directories successfully. I had enabled end-to-end encryption when I was running 13.0.0 and things were working fine at that time. However, since the upgrade either the files don't get uploaded at all or if they do get uploaded then I get the following error in the server while trying to access it from the app ""OCP\Encryption\Exceptions\GenericEncryptionException: Missing Signature""

### Expected behaviour
The files should get uploaded to an encrypted directory successfully and the ability to preview/download it on the app again

1. Create an encrypted directory from the app
2. Manually upload a few files

nextcloud/android,closed,"context might be null, so fallback",[],"Reported via google play console.

We are using this in all static theming calls.
It seems to happen, maybe due to race conditions, that context is null (MainApp not entirely set up yet), but there is already a call to theming.

This prevents from having a NPE within AccountUtils.getCurrentOwnCloudAccount(context) when context is null.
Instead we simply return a default OCCapability.

This function is only used from within ThemeUtils, so the ""worst"" that could happen is that we fallback to the default theming.

nextcloud/android,open,Android Client problem with external storage,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello
I’ve got Nextcloud 13 on a home server with an external storage
Very regularly, my Android app on a Galaxy S6 is not able to show the contents of a folder, to download ou upload a file. For example when sending a file to Nextcloud via the Android Share option, I get an Android notification “serveur under maintenance”.
It really seems an Android app problem.
Just after a failed action with the Android app, I open my Android web browser and connect to the nextcloud and browse to open the external storage root folder. I just open, without any action
Then I come back to the my previous action : for exemple come back to the Androi app and download a file, or come back to resend the file to via the Share option, the action is sucessful.

I never get problem when accessing with the web browser , or with other android applications linked to nextcloud : I use Foldersync and it always works , I use also keepassandroid which opens a file on my external storage; it works too.

I’d had always had this problem, I hoped the recent Android nextcloud 3 app would solve the problem. I’ve got the log of the last problem logged bu the nextcloud server. I can send it if helps

Thanks

With access to your command line run e.g.:
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:show-config
from within your Nextcloud installation folder

Without access to your command line download the data/owncloud.db to your local
computer or access your SQL server remotely and run the select query:
SELECT * FROM `oc_appconfig` WHERE `appid` = 'user_ldap';


Eventually replace sensitive data as the name/IP-address of your LDAP server or groups.

nextcloud/android,closed,NextCloud 3.0.3 randomly generated login failures server side,"[Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
I use NextCloud 3.0.3. Serverside I scan the `nextcloud,log `for login failures and I block access via `fail2ban` after x login failures. The username is okay (in nextcloud) so the password is most likely wrong. 

Now it seems that randomly the Android Application is causing login failures. So if it uploads 5 photo's it suddenly fails on photo 3, so the first 2 go correctly. Also I see in the Android App the message something like ""Checking the stored credentials"". 

So it seems that if we store the nextcloud credentials (""keep me logged in"") is not always retrieving the right password!?

NextCloud 3.03 does not initialize after reinstall. After providing login credentials, you get a ""REDIRECTING....""  screen with a looping spinner. This screen never goes away.

it seems like that the developers do not trust this new 'login' method themselves since they show an option to use the 'old login method' in this 'redirecting'  screen, but that also does not work. 

### Expected behaviour
This ""Redirecting""  screen should go away.

1. Uninstall NextCloud Android
2. Install NextCloud Andorid 3.0.3
3. Provide URL/userid/pwd.

nextcloud/android,closed,Use Lombok to remove boilerplate code,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour

Currently, there is a lot of boilerplate code present in classes, say FileSystemDataSet.java, under datamodel directory.

### Expected behaviour

Use Lombok to replace the boilerplate code. Use appropriate annotations to generate the getters, setters etc., rather than including all of them in the main class. This would make the code a lot more cleaner and structured.

Changes : Earlier the image icon size was quite large due to which a fraction
of text height was invisible even though the layout_height for the
text view was set to wrap_content. Now, the image icon dimensions have
been changed from 72dp to 64dp so that the text is wrapped properly
within the text view.

nextcloud/android,closed,Login with app password not working (2fa TOTP),[],"### Actual behaviour
When trying to login using an app password, the app gets stuck on a blank screen with waiting animation (waited 10 minutes and nothing happens).
This was working before but I don't know why/when it actually stopped working since I haven't used the app for a couple of weeks before I re-installed it last weekend.

### Expected behaviour
App should login
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Install and activate the Two Factor TOTP Provider app on the server
2. Activate 2fa for your account
3. Generate an app password on the server
4. Open the Talk app and enter your server URL
5. Tap on ""Alternate login with app password""

nextcloud/android,open,Display pop-up right from the start in case of incompatible client/server versions,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","At the moment we don't check the server version with regards to even working at all.
With the change of the user agent we break compatibility with any server version lower than 11.0.8.

Thus when logging in we should show a blocking pop-up that the server is incompatible with the client and needs to be upgraded for the client to work.
This differs from the webUI since the webUI comes with the server and thus always works (except for browser issues) while the native clients depend on the server APIs etc. So they will break at some point like they did now. So it is okay to tell it to the users and not let them any further (since it'll crash or loop, or else anyways).

This way the user knows the real issue and this might then also lower the amount of 1-star ratings in the app store which are simply due to folk operating servers which are end of life.

Currently (with old and new sync implementation) a dialog showing a conflicting file can be shown even if the app is in background, which should be avoided as it distracts the user.

In my opinion there are three possible solutions
- show a notification once the conflict appears 
- show conflicting dialog once the app is resumed 
- do not show anything, but only if user enters the folder show the conflicting file with a red ""!"". When clicking the file show the conflict dialog.

- Davdroid
- Simpletask Nextcloud
- Notes for Nextcloud
- Advanced Call Recorder
- Davdroid
- Nextcloud News
- Nextcloud Bookmarks

...and a couple I don't even remember the name of (like the FOSS app I use to track my car expenses, which syncs over Nextcloud).

Each of these I had to go through and painstakingly log in via the web interface, go to the personal settings menu, then security, then set up an app password, then find a way to copy that  password across to my phone, then find and enter the server url (some apps are fine with the base url, some need the full path to remote.php), the user name and the app token...

...and all of that is just if it's all correct and working the first time! Honestly, each time, it's tempting just to use my administrator password as I know it and it's much quicker to enter. This is not good user experience or encouraging security!

I really wish that after installing the nextcloud app, in the other apps, I could just click a ""Use Nextcloud account"" button, that just asked the Nextcloud Android app for a 1-click permission to access my nextcloud server. If there is more than one account, then it would just be one more click to choose which one.

I imagine that behind the scenes it would work something like this:
1. User has installed and setup the Nextcloud Android app.
2. User installs an app designed to use this new system and clicks on a ""Use Nextcloud account"" (or similar) button. (The requesting app)
3. The requesting app passes a request to access a nextcloud account, with it's name and whether it needs file access, to the Nextcloud app.
4. The nextcloud app pops up a dialogue asking whether to allow the requesting app access to the nextcloud account (and files if requested). If authorized, it asks which account to use (of the ones set up in the NC apps).
5. After authorization, the NC app passes the requesting app name to the server, and gets back an app token.
6. The Nextcloud app passes the username and token to the requesting app, which then uses that from then on to sync with the nextcloud account.


If permission was granted, then the app would automatically pass the requesting app name to the server, and get back a new app token from the server. This would be passed back to the original requesting app, which would use these from now on."

nextcloud/android,closed,"REQ: clear the history of the ""Uploaded"" section.",[],"Actual behaviour

-Tell us what happens

The ""Uploaded"" section has hunderds of succesful uploads with small previews listed over the last year. (In my case) the originals of these pictures have been automatically deleted via Auto-Upload.

-Tell us what should happen

The possibility to select the whole or individual entries in the ""Uploaded"" section and delete them.
After seeing that the upload has taken place, the long history serves no purpose in this section for me anymore (other than to show me the preview of a embarrassing picture I have deleted :-)

Steps to reproduce

    Take a photo
    Go to Main menu, Uploads, browse to ""Uploaded"" section.

Environment data

Android version: 7.1.1

Device model: Samsung Note 8

Nextcloud server version: 13.0.0"
nextcloud/android,open,RFE: Allow setting a delay before auto upload,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens

Set auto upload to delete after upload. Take a photo. Go to show it to someone in the on-device gallery, and it's gone. Go to edit it on device, it's gone. Go to email/text it, it's gone.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen

It's very convenient to have photos auto uploaded, and deleting them after successful upload helps manage device space utilization. But the immediacy of the upload/delete causes usage problems. 

Ideally, should be able to set a delay between the photo being created and the upload/delete (i.e., file age greater than x minutes). Setting the delay to zero would work as it does now. Setting it to greater than zero would only consider photos/videos that we last modified per the setting.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Take a photo
2. Open the gallery
3. Where's the photo?

nextcloud/android,open,Improper text wrapping in the grid view of All files activity,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour

Currently, the height of the text contents in the text view is greater than the height of the view itself. Due to this a fraction of the height of the text strings becomes invisible.

### Expected behaviour

The text needs to be wrapped properly within the text view.
 
### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the app and log into your account.
2.  Open the All files activity 
3. Choose Grid view from the Options menu in the Action Bar
4. You'll see the following, as in the attached screenshot.

When you access the ldap server and log in using ldap users, not only is it slower, but the favorites and pictures in the drawer bar have been sharing these features all the time, but no matter how long they are, they won't show the result.

### Expected behaviour
 display normal results after loading
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Correctly configure the ldap account on the server side
2. Then log in to the android client using the ldap account

nextcloud/android,open,InstantUpload corrupt JPEG pictures,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour

- I synchronize my SnapSeed folder with InstantUpload, and some pictures got corrupted while transferred on my Nextcloud instance. 
- https://pics.benpro.fr/TIADhO5q/X5fhbyfb.jpeg
- My guess is that InstantUpload send the picture before the picture was successfully written by SnapSeed/Android.

- No corruption
 
### Steps to reproduce

1. Install SnapSeed
2. Edit some pictures & configure InstantUpload to upload SnapSeed folder
3. Some pictures got corrupted

I used the E2EE Server app from master, this is the same as 1.0.4 beside that I improved the error message to display the user agent string. As you can see the client sends ""Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/3.0.2"" while we expect ""Mozilla/5.0 (Android) Nextcloud-android/3.0.2""

Maybe this is fixed with 3.0.3? Maybe @tobiasKaminsky can test it... unfortunately 3.0.3 is not yet available via f-droid

First there are only two basic test ""suites"", create folder and upload file.
Both have two test cases, which try to create folder / upload file in one existing folder and in an non-existing folder.

It spins up a server with latest master, which as a user test, where we can do testing.

CodeCov takes reports from unit and integration tests and shows a summary.

After all this is only a very basic/tiny step to introduce testing:
- write unit tests

nextcloud/android,closed,Added the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission to the Android manifest.,[],"With API 26 (Android O) any app that wants to install unknown apps must declare the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission. The user can then control what specific apps should be allowed to install unknown apps unlike the previous system where it was a system wide binary option for all apps.

With this permission added the user will be prompted to grant the app permission to install apps from unknown sources should they attempt to do so .

nextcloud/android,open,E2E encryption : not able to re-enable a folder as E2E encrypted,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I've set a folder as being E2E encrypted (from Windows client). It worked.
I have some random files (testing the tech now, not using it) in there.

Yesterday, from my Android 8 phone, I set the folder as Not Encrypted :
* files remain encrypted in the folder ... is it expected ?
* I cannot set it back to E2E encrypted folder on Android ... had to do it again from the Windows client
* Once I set it back on Windows client : the decrypted files appeared ... along with the encrypted ones ! These ""duplicates"" are the encrypted & non-encrypted versions.

### Expected behaviour
* EITHER Not being able to disable E2E encryption if files will not be decrypted, hence (files) will not be available anymore
* OR : decrypt files before setting it back to normal (not E2E) fodler

* AND : be able to re-enable the E2E encryption from the Android client
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. create a folder, put some files in it
2. sync with your winodws & android client
3. go on android, set the folder as NOT encrypted ... you cannot se it back

nextcloud/android,closed,"""Upload failed: Could not complete operation. Server unavailable.""","[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Photos are not uploaded to the Nextcloud instance via Auto Upload. Instead, a notification stating ""Upload failed: Could not complete operation. Server unavailable."" is generated each time an upload is attempted.
Ironically I am using the Nextcloud android app to upload the app's log to the exact Nextcloud instance it doesn't upload the photos to. :smile: 


### Expected behaviour
With *Auto upload* being activated, photos should be uploaded to Nextcloud instance.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Activate Auto upload for camera folder

nextcloud/android,closed,Auto upload folder path isn't visible past 2 lines,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""good first issue""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
When doing a custom folder setup in Auto Upload, after selecting the path of the local folder, the displayed path is visible only as far as the two lines flow on the screen, the rest is clipped. For me, it usually clipped it at the end of a folder name, so it made the impression that it's always a parent folder selected, and never the exact folder I selected in the explorer. Of course, this wasn't the actual case, but it remained frustrating until I went with it and tested it to see that it actually checks the right folder.

### Expected behaviour
 The full path should be visible, broken into as many lines as needed.

### Steps to reproduce
Go to Auto Uploads and Set up a custom folder with a really long local path.

I also have no issue using the nextcloud web interface, so it definitely has something to do with the new login method.

nextcloud/android,closed,"Remove ""change password"" ","[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","Change password is currently changing only the password with which the app authenticates to the server.
If this password is not valid anylonger, e.g. when the auth token is revoked, the user gets the Authenticator/Login screen presented. So this is all fine.

Currently when clicking on ""change password"" this just opens up AuthenticatorActivity / Weblogin flow, which can change the internal stored password, but as seen above, this is useless.
A real password changing is only possible via webUI and should only be done there, especially if other user backends are handled there.

Therefore I suggest to remove the ""change password"" option."
nextcloud/android,closed,TimSort: Add correct null check,[],"Spend quite a long time on this to understand the problem.

Imagine you compare o1 and o2 and both are null.
Previous, depending on your compare order, it could happen:
compare(o1, o2) -> -1, which leads to o1 < o2
compare(o2, o1) -> -1, which leads to o2 < o1
and this is not allowed.

So if both are null, there is no sorting order, so it returns 0.

This, however does not solve other sorting problems, e.g. where OCFiles are sorted via the compareTo function in OCFile as there would be a NPE if some file/remote path is null.

Left: source folder, file 1.txt is moved
Right: same folder as ""target"", but only folders are shown.

If you enter a folder with only files, it would show ""no files here"", which is wrong.
This activity is used widely across the app, from copy/move to folder picker for synced folders.

nextcloud/android,closed,Auto upload custom remote folder setup problem,[],"### Credits and intro
First things first: Thank you so much for conceiving and maintaining the grand Nextcloud project. You rock!

I am finally moving to mobile and obviously want to use Nextcloud instead of sharing my personal data with Google or others. Using DAVdroid for syncing contact information works perfectly already so i am now trying to tackle the automatic image upload feature by using the Nextcloud Android App. However, i found a minor issue when configuring the custom settings.

### Actual behaviour
I am trying to configure a custom remote folder for the ""Auto upload"" feature. Unfortunately, i am not able to actually save these settings. The ""SAVE"" button just doesn't respond. Using ""CANCEL"" works, though - but obviously doesn't store the desired settings.

### Expected behaviour
The ""SAVE"" button on the custom folder settings dialog actually works and the desired ""Auto upload"" custom folder settings get applied properly.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Navigate to ""Auto upload""
2. Use button ""Set up a custom folder"" at the top to display settings dialog
3. Try to tap the ""SAVE"" button...
4. ... it does not respond ;[.

nextcloud/android,open,"picture thumbnails are wrong in the ""Auto upload"" and ""Upload"" pages of app","[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- photo thumbnails in the Auto upload page are wrong. showing old photos that i deleted a long time ago. In the upload window, the thumbnail for the photo being auto-uploaded is also wrong.

### Expected behaviour
- Thumbnails should show the correct photos that actually exist on the device. 
- thumbnails should show the correct photo being uploaded to server
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. take some photos
2. delete one or more of those photos
3. wait until auto-upload triggers
4. check thumbnails in the ""Auto upload"" and ""Upload"" pages

nextcloud/android,closed,"When there auto upload conditions (WiFi, charge) app should only queue files when conditions are met",[],"Not really a bug, just improvement suggestion

### Actual behaviour
- Auto upload starts queuing files for upload as soon as photo is taken. If file is deleted a few minutes later, it remains in the upload queue. Later, once the app is ready to upload (WiFi and charging conditions are met) the app returns an error saying that local file is not found

### Expected behaviour
- App should not try and upload deleted files. Should check for files to be uploaded at the time of upload so that it doesn't try and upload non-existent files
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. take some photos
2. delete one or more photos
3. trigger auto-upload by connecting to charging and wifi (this assumes you have set those conditions, instead of uploading immediately)

nextcloud/android,open,"Directory has no space left, but Nextcloud app will not stop trying to upload","[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
On latest Android release Nextcloud is attempting to sync over a ton of photos to my 12.0.5 server, which ran out of space, but the app continues to attempt to complete the upload of all remaining files.  I couldn’t figure out how to make the app stop/pause uploading (more space on the server was not available) so I deleted the app.

### Expected behaviour
Once the server runs out of space (maybe less than 1% remaining space) the app will pause uploads. If space is not available, the app will not resume uploading.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Upload files to a Directory with no storage space."

Autoupload is not auto uploading files, while in battery-saver mode (Stamnia on Sony), even though the Nextcloud app is checked for not-optimised in Battery-Saver_mode (""nicht optimiert"" in ""Akku-Leistungsoptimierung"") 
Sorry, but for some words I do not know their exact english counterparts (mine is german)

### Expected behaviour
Nextcloud used to auto-upload just fine before 3.0.0 (even if in Stamnia Mode)

1. Activate Stamnia Mode
2. check Nextcloud in Stamnia Mode whitelist
3. activate Autoupload

nextcloud/android,closed,E2E: Private key decryption fails on fresh install. IV mismatch,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","I've tested the following on API level 23 with the code from master and on API level 27 with #2154 and the same issue happens on both. 

Steps to reproduce: 

1. Install the app, create an encrypted folder, saving the pass phrase. 
2. Uninstall the app, re-install it
3. Try to access the encrypted folder. You are prompted for the pass phrase. Enter the previously used pass phrase.
4. Decryption fails. The user is hinted about the pass phrase possibly being incorrect.

Debugging reveals that the pass phrase is being parsed correctly and matches the one used to encrypt the private key in step 1. However, the IV is completely different. It's not clear to me how the IV is retrieved across re-installs of the app so that they can match up. Is the IV stored server-side along with the salt?

Currently, this means that it's impossible to recover your encrypted files should you ever change devices or re-install the app.

nextcloud/android,closed,If app fails to store the E2E encryption keys the public key should be deleted from the server,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","Currently, the public key is posted to the E2E server side app and stored there for the user before the Android app tries to store the associated keys locally. If this fails, the user is prompted to create a new key the next time they try to go through the encryption process. This will then always fail because the server will return a 409 error as a public key already exists. I think the correct behavior would be to send a DELETE request to the E2E API to remove the uploaded public key.

Furthermore, the private key needs to be removed as well."

nextcloud/android,open,Auto-uploaded files that are moved to app folder are deleted from local storage the next time the folder is viewed in the app,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","exactly the same issue like described in #735 and fixed by @tobiasKaminsky 
### Actual behaviour
After images are taken and auto-uploaded, they are moved to the app folder as expected. However, the next time the folder containing those images are viewed in the Nextcloud app, the images are deleted.

### Expected behaviour
The images should not be deleted and should appear with a green checkmark as with all other locally-available files.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Enable auto upload for e.g. the camera
2. Change ""Original file will be..."" to ""moved to app folder""
3. Take a picture
4. View the upload subfolder of the app folder in a file explorer and notice that the image has been moved there
5. Open the upload folder in the app and notice that the newly-uploaded image has a green checkmark, then see the checkmark is gone and file is deleted in file system
6. View the upload subfolder of the app folder in a file explorer again and notice that the image is gone

nextcloud/android,closed,It's confusing that you delete your account and not log out,"[Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
Users we tested this with find it confusing that you have to delete your account.

### Expected behaviour
That you log out instead of delete the account. It basically amounts to almost the same. It would just be a matter of wording.

Feel free to close this issue as won't fix, if this is not something you plan to change.

Deleting the account is too hidden.

Most users we have tested this with, do not find out how to delete the account. Have the account deletion not that well hidden. Maybe not in the three dots menu at the top of the user page, but on the user page itself. Or even earlier than that in one of the menus.

nextcloud/android,open,"Idea: Upload only when connected to ""x"" network","[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","I'm really dying for the ability to allow automatic uploading only when connected to a specific network.

Currently I'm using Tasker to basically start the Nextcloud app only when I am connected to my home network. When on the local network where my Nextcloud server is running it allows uploading of images 100x faster. The problem is the mess of having to set this up and kill the app on a device reboot (so it won't upload on the wrong network).

Could we please get a simple feature to specific the SSID of networks we allow auto upload jobs to run when connected to?

Thanks."

nextcloud/android,open,Upload fails due to connection timeout (connection seems cached),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I noticed this happening intermittently. Took me some time to hunt it enough to create issue. Basically, my automatic uploads are failing and files will not be uploaded after I switch from telco provider internet to wi-fi. Only solution seems to be to restart phone (killing app doesn't seem to help). My upload directory is set to ""only on wi-fi"". I take a picture while away from home (on telco 4G connection), and when I am back home, upload is failing.

Now, weird thing in exception is mentioning of address ""217.65.192.33"". This is not my Nextcloud server and [searching for it online](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=217.65.192.33) gives that it is gateway of my provider. I do not know what the heck is my telco provider's gateway doing in exception *after* I have been connected to wi-fi:) This is why I am suspecting it has to do something with caching of connections, but I am not sure. I am hoping experts can help.

This is [where I commented](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/android-app-cant-connect/24615/10) and which seems like a similar (or same) issue (not ipv6 related, I think).

### Expected behaviour
Upload should work:)
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Set up directory to automatically upload on wi-fi only
2. Go to telco internet connection (away from where any wi-fi will be automatically connected),
3. restart phone, so any connection cache is cleared
4. Take a picture
5. ??? (cannot easily reproduce, not sure what it is, but there ain't no profit afterwards:)
6. Go back to wi-fi connection
7. Automatic upload should upload picture, but it is not working with ConnectionTimeout

nextcloud/android,open,Auto uploads 'Waiting for Wi-Fi' when connected to VPN over Wi-Fi,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
For auto upload of photos, I have the setting enabled 'Only upload on Wi-Fi' enabled. This option works fine on Wi-Fi without VPN enabled. With VPN enabled, all my uploads sit in the queue with 'Waiting on Wi-Fi'. 

I did a little debugging and built my own APK with additional logging and the call to Device.getNetworkType() is returning NOT_ROAMING. It looks like this decision is made in the android-job library which is making a call to ConnectivityManagerCompat.isActiveNetworkMetered() (https://github.com/evernote/android-job/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/evernote/android/job/util/Device.java#L107) which is returning true for some reason when connected over VPN. 

This lead me down a path of finding out that Android adheres to a DHCP option that can set the network as metered, so I thought maybe the Wi-Fi network I was connected to was returning this value (although I would expect it to exhibit same behavior without VPN connected). I followed the instructions here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23877476/android-why-connectivitymanager-isactivenetworkmetered-always-returning-true#23879816) to explicitly mark my Wi-Fi as unmetered but I still am seeing the same behavior where network type is returning as NOT_ROAMING.

Some additional debug logging I added to UploadFileOperation.java when connected to VPN:
```
02-02 22:17:56.067 12027 12070 I UploadFileOperation: DEBUG: networkInfo.getType(): 1
02-02 22:17:56.577 12027 12070 I UploadFileOperation: DEBUG: networkInfo.getTypeName(): WIFI
02-02 22:17:56.842 12027 12070 I UploadFileOperation: DEBUG: networkInfo.isAvailable(): true
02-02 22:17:57.192 12027 12070 I UploadFileOperation: DEBUG: networkInfo.isConnected(): true
02-02 22:19:54.116 12027 12070 I UploadFileOperation: DEBUG: Device.getNetworkType(mContext): NOT_ROAMING
```

### Expected behaviour
When I'm connected on Wi-Fi, ignore the fact I'm connected to VPN, and upload my photos.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Connect to strongSwan VPN
2. Enable 'Only upload on Wi-Fi' option for camera photos
3. Take a photo
4. Photo sits in queue 'Waiting for Wi-fi'

Any transfer of files - upload (manual or auto upload) or download - fails with a ""Server unavailable"" error message when the app file directory is unavailable due to the SD card having been changed earlier - which means the SD card directory set in the app was (as an example) ""AB12-CD34"" while the current SD card was referenced to by the system as ""DE56-FG78"". 

### Expected behaviour
The app should show an error message like ""App directory unavailable, please fix"". 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Set Nextcloud storage path to the SD card.
2. Remove the SD card and insert another SD card.
3. Try to upload or download any file.

Uploads very often (>80%) fails with ""upload failed"" error and no other info. It went through after couple of retries (either manually, or automatically), but it is very annoying, especially when I am taking picture and want it very fast on desktop/laptop.

Not sure if it might be related, but I have both 2.0 and beta from F-Droid. Maybe they are trying to lock at the same time? Not sure.

I am proposing doing exponential backoff with random timeouts (for example, 5 retries, timeout is rand(0, iteration * 200ms). I can jump to implementation, as this is very annoying (and I can test it along the way).

### Expected behaviour
Upload should succeed in larger number of cases
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Take a picture/video
2. Wait until automatic upload starts
3. See if it fails

nextcloud/android,closed,Apply new theming when folder refresh finishes,"[Label(name=""1. developing"")]","When synchronization of the folder finishes it is possible that theming can also change. At this moment it is not possible to tell. So what we do is to re-setup parts of the UI to stay consistent with the server theming.


===

This is not even close to being elegant solution, but at the moment so many things would required to be hanged that the small pain of re-setup views doesn't sound as a bad trade-off.

The purest of the solution would require the following:
* Storing capabilities should be moved from ContentResolver to other database API, preferably Room, since it supports LiveData
* Activity should subscribe to the database by using LiveData for any theming changes, then apply them to its subchildren. Fragments could do the same
* Ideally there should be a way to generate Theme object on the fly and apply it to the children, doable, but have several drawbacks"

nextcloud/android,open,Capabilities update are not distributing on live view,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","When user is updating the list, it often happens that server capabilities are also updated.
Server capabilities for instance contains theming colors. After refreshing is completed FileDisplayActivity is refreshing its fragments, which are refreshing its list adapter.
The list adapter is getting the theme information directly from ThemeUtils, which has up to date information about coloring. So what happens if theme is changed between refreshes is that the icons are changing colors and app theming stays the same.
![zrzut ekranu 2018-01-30 o 17 30 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1734309/35578047-5140af8c-05e3-11e8-911e-16e28c961fbe.png)
This might lead to some bad user experience, from visual point of view, but could have more devastating causes, (undeleting?).

nextcloud/android,closed,Setting up encryption on another device,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""pr exists""), Label(name=""release candidate"")]","### Actual behaviour
I have a NC 13.0.0 RC2 (now RC3) with the 1.0.2 E2E encryption app. I use it with 2 (already configured) android devices. I signed up for the Beta and both devices got updated to the 3.0.0 RC2 android clients.

On devce A I set a folder as encrypted, it showed me the 12 words passcode. I checked on the server and everything is encoded. Fine.

On device B I checked and the folder is shown as encrypted. I tried to enter that folder and it tells me, it is setting up encryption and creating a new key (obviously false behaviour). It then told me it could not write the key (because there already is one stored on the server?). 
On device B I set a second folder as encrypted. Worked. I tried to enter it, again it tried to set up encryption and write the key.
On device A I entered the encrypted folder and everything looks good.

I tried to manually configure the encryption with my keywords, but I could not find anything.
I uninstalled the nextcloud app on device B and reinstall and configure it. No change.

### Expected behaviour
If the encryption is already set up, I would expect a dialog to enter the keywords (passwords?), or the possibility to deconfigure the encryption and delete all encrypted data (with extra safety, please).
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Configure encrypted folder on device A
2. Try to access that folder from device B

nextcloud/android,closed,Autoupload only works for image file types,[],"### Actual behaviour
Non-image files in a monitored folder are not autouploaded to InstantUpload folders on the server.This has been the case since v2.0.0. Expert mode force rescan doesn't help. Unfortunately logs are not available because the v3 beta client crashes when trying to look at the logs, and the v2 client doesn't generate logs.

The Android client version prior to 2.0.0 would upload all files in a monitored folder, whether image or non-image. It would only allow selecting folders with images in them for autoupload, but at least once selected it would upload all the files in that folder.

### Expected behaviour
All files in an autoupload folder should be uploaded, not just image files.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Select folder for autoupload.
2. Add PDF or other non-image file to autoupload folder.

nextcloud/android,open,Sharing encrypted folder,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi,

**Issue**
An encrypted folder has been shared with a user and he can neither access the files in the folder nor upload to it. Maybe the sharing feature is simply not ready yet? 



**Setup**
Client: Android 6.0.1, Nextcloud Android 3.0.0 RC2
Server: Centos 7, PHP 7.0, Nextcloud 13, end_to_end_encryption app 1.0.3

**How to reproduce**
1) UserA creates an encrypted folder with userB
2) UserA uploads a file to the encrypted folder
3) UserA shares the encrypted folder with userB with all permissions available through webUI
4) UserB accesses the shared folder. The file names he sees are scrambled (a mix of numbers and lower case letters) and when he clicks to download a file, error with title ""Download failed"" and message ""The file is no longer available on the server"" appears
5) UserA uploads another file to the encrypted folder
6) UserB accesses the shared folder. Since step 5) it oddly appears empty now
7) UserB tries to upload a file to the shared folder, but upload fails


Thanks 😃

nextcloud/android,closed,Auto-Upload completely messes up the nextcloud file base,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
You can set up a custom auto upload folder. You can do so by selecting the local nextcloud data folder, hoping to get something resembling the two-way sync the windows client has been able do perform for years.
Actual behavior: the android client does upload the whole folder structure, **ignoring** folder names in the process. You end up with millions of files in the ROOT folder.

After deleting the messed up crap, I can sync as often as I want, the millions of files remain on the android client. I have to delete the account completely and re-setup everything

### Expected behaviour
Any behavior other than what is happening in the 3.0.0 RC2
Best guesses: don't accept the nextcloud data folder, if keeping the folder structure is such a big deal
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. using windows set up some files in subfolders
2.  sync everything to the android client. You have to select EVERY subfolder manually to do so.
3.  set up auto-upload to upload the /sdcard/0/nextcloud/user@server/ folder to /
4. sit back and watch the android client up- and downloading all the files

> Do not place Android context classes in static fields; this is a memory leak (and also breaks Instant Run) less...
A static field will leak contexts.  Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected.  Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these longer running instances can cause leaks.  ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.

Maybe we can avoid this somehow?"

nextcloud/android,closed,How to enable auto-upload for all file types and not just pictures?,[],"On Nextcloud Android App v2.0.0 I am able to successfully auto-upload images to my Nextcloud server from Chromebook Pro.

I need everything to auto-upload that goes into this particular folder, such as tar.gz files and pdf files and 7z files and maybe binary files. I suspect this might be an intended limitation, but considering image-uploads work just fine I don't quite understand why it would be unavailable to other file types. As such, I've made an assumption that perhaps it must be available and I simply cannot find where to enable it.

nextcloud/android,closed,Supported Android versions,"[Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","Looking at the actual Play store stats and the offline discussions I'd like to raise this topic:
Which Android versions should we support?

Right now we support 4.0.x - 8.x (aka latest)

The Play store stats for the bottom ranking Android versions are:
* Android version - active devices (total) - active devices (%)
* Android 4.4 - 5,928 - 3.9%
* Android 4.2 - 1,152 - 0.8%
* Android 4.1 - 865 - 0.6%
* Android 4.3 - 532 - 0.4%
* Android 4.0.x - 229 - 0.2%

This adds up to 5,9 percent or >8000 devices. 

I suggest to drop 4.0.x (no proper font support) at least or even 4.1 (no proper RTL support). 
To be discussed could be to drop all of the above mentioned and go for minimum version Android 5.

In any case I would vote for doing this after 3.1 hoping that E2E will then be shipping increment 2 and we have the second release with Nc13 support, so people could still use that release until Nc14 comes out (roughly a year) until then 4.x numbers should be even lower.

nextcloud/android,open,Switching Wifi only preference does not affect already queued jobs,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
The preference of whether uploading should be done over only Wifi or allow mobile data is stored into every queued job, instead of getting polled from the folder preferences. If a job is already queued, it will get queued using the initial settings that were set during its creation. Any changes to the settings after that are ignored.

### Expected behaviour
-A job belonging to the autoupload of a certain folder should poll the current settings of that folder to know how to proceed, not insist on using the settings that existed during the job creation.
 
### Steps to reproduce
-Have the Camera folder set to autoupload using Wifi only.
-Turn off Wifi
-Take a bunch of photos.
-You notice they are in the queue, but waiting for Wifi to upload
-Go to Camera autoupload preferences, switch off the ""wifi only"" option, to allow mobile data uploads.
-The queued jobs would still wait for Wifi.
-Taking a new photo will instantly upload over mobile data. But already queued ones will wait indefinetly till Wifi is turned on.

Workaround: Move the files to a temp folder. Force rescan, all jobs will fail as files are now missing. Copy the files to their original folder (moving for some reason didn't work, does the app keep inodes or something?), the App will now recreate the upload jobs using new settings. Once upload completes, delete temp folder.

After my app updated and the Nextcloud icon changed (3.0.0 RC1), every time i typed in my password it took me to my files but immediately back to the login screen. The only way to fix was by uninstalling and reinstalling. Also, it crashed when going to the backup contacts screen.

nextcloud/android,closed,Files and folders are displayed twice after they had once marked as favorite,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists""), Label(name=""release candidate"")]","As requested in the help forum (https://help.nextcloud.com/t/help-test-the-android-3-0rc1-client/25912/14) , I've created this issue ticket. The root cause might be related to other issues which have already been reported, like https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1908.

### Actual behaviour
After I’ve installed the latest app version (3.0 RC1) I realized the following behavior:

- In the past I had marked several folders and files as favorites which caused double entries in the favorites menu. Although I’ve removed the favorite marker, I still got double files and folders displayed if I browsed through the folder tree.

- I’ve removed all favorite markers in the app so that the favorites folder itself was empty. Nevertheless some of the favorite markers automatically reappearing after I’d refreshed the folder?!

As recommended in the help forum I tried to get rid of the double entries by using the refresh function. Unfortunately the refresh function seems not to work as expected because I wasn’t able to delete double entries by refresh the folder view. On my web server I saw that the app requested an update but it had no effect on how the sub-folder was displayed in the app.

### Expected behaviour
File and folder entries shouldn't be displayed twice if they had been marked as favorite for a while.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. I decided to delete the app to start from scratch. After I've installed the app again and entering my credentials I opened the folder and now all sub-folders and files were only displayed once. Then I marked a file and a sub-folder as favorite and switch to the favorite menu entry in the app.
2. Surprisingly both favorites were displayed twice again. I return to the original folder and checked the original file and and folder entries again and now the **favorite** directory and file entries were displayed twice in that view too.
3. I wasn’t able to solve it be deselecting the favorite markers. The folder view still showed double entries.

It might be of relevance that the files and folders reside on a WebDAV share.

nextcloud/android,closed,Android App - Set Up Encryption fails,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""release candidate"")]","### Actual behaviour
Fails to setup encryption option on android app.

### Expected behaviour
N/A
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Select folder to encrypt.  
2. Tap menu.  
3. Select ""Set as encrypted"".  
4. Click folder.  
    --> ""Note your encryption passphrase..."".  
5. Click ""Set Up Encryption"".  
   --> Error message ""Error.  Storing keys was unsuccessful, please try it again!"".
6. Click close.
   --> (If you try to enter the ""encrypted"" folder, the process (and error) repeats from step 4).

If I try to access the encrypted folder via the web portal, it errors (probably expected behavior?).  

Nothing useful seen in server log because it does not record the client-side error (but it does record the accessing encrypted folder failure, which is normal I think?).  I am happy to try to provide additional info.

If I try to send app logs, the app crashes ('Nextcloud has stopped').  But even so, there are no app log entries associated with the encryption set-up failure anyway.

nextcloud/android,closed,Android (playstore) app will not log in to server 12.04 backend,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Unable to log in with either the Beta client or the regular android client. This happened on an install of server 12.03 and then an upgraded version of 12.04 as well as a fresh install of 12.04 (except I preserved the data folder). When attempting to log in I click the ""grant access"" button enter a user name and password and the app ""spins"" for ever before prompting me to revert to the older style login. Tailing the logs on the server shows that the request is made, I see responses from `remote.php/webdav` and some entries. When I try and invalid password the app still spins for ever but the server logs show the invalid access attempt. 

If I keep trying (I spent 3 hours trying to log in and debug this myself) one in maybe 20 tries the login succeeds but I am greeted with no files or folders and what appears to be constant scanning until either the app crashes or my screen goes to sleep. When either event happens the app is logged out (despite having clicked the ""remember"" option) and I have to start the whole process again.

Using a mobile browser yields no problems. Additionally, using the *owncloud beta* android app (which is free) allows me to log in and have the instant upload of my photos (which is my main concern). Desktop browsers as well as desktop integration works as expected so I am sure this is a problem with the android app. Previously I had no problems, I have been using the beta app for the last several months without issue

### Expected behaviour
- I expect to be able to log in and see my files as I am able to with the owncloud app
 
### Steps to reproduce
1.  Download the nextcloud-client app (or beta) from the play store
2.  Attempt to log in with username and password
3.  Never actually able to log in

The thing is that the issue is more than weird. I do have an older smartphone Meizu M2 with Android 5.1 and Flyme OS 4.5.3I and Nextcloud app is working well with Nextcloud server.

Here is server SSL configuration:

```
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/ec.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/ec.key;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_ciphers ""ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !3DES !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS !RC4 !SEED !CAMELLIA"";
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_tickets off;
        ssl_ecdh_curve auto;
        ssl_stapling on;
        ssl_stapling_verify on;
        ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/full-chain.crt;
```

The certificate is generated with secp384r1 elliptic curve and Must-Staple extension, however that shouldn't be a problem, since it is working with older Android.

I commented each additional directive one by one until just a standard SSL setup left and tested the app but it didn't connect. 

Unfortunately, the device is not rooted and I'm not able to get logs from Samsung, tried with CatLog.

Server details if needed:

During redaction, it occurred to me that I have added two accounts - one private and one for work. Although Auto-upload is only configured for the private one, the app *might* be confused by that, although I cannot say if this is actually the case.

I *could* try deleting the work account from the app, but I *do* believe this should work, so I'll put that off until instructed by a dev..."
nextcloud/android,closed,E2E Allow to select/copy the encryption passphrase,"[Label(name=""E2E""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- The passphrase in the ""Note your encryption passphrase"" dialogue is not ""selectable"" in order to copy it to the android clipboard.

### Expected behaviour
- Maybe this is by design but IMHO you should be able to select (and copy) the passphrase in the ""Note your encryption passphrase"" dialogue in order to paste the phrase to a safe location.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Mark folder
2. Choose ""set as encrypted""

nextcloud/android,closed,Thumbnails of deleted pictures are still visible in activity list,[],"### Actual behaviour
The thumbnails of deleted photos are still visible in the activity list of my android nextcloud -app . It seems that they are saved (cached or whatever) on android system (!?) Accessing server’s activity list with desktop browser there are of course no thumbnails visible .In android they appear as if the photos/pictures are still accessable (of course when I click on the link to the photo in activity list the notification “Not accessable” appears).
**_That’s irritating for me - why are the thumbnails not deleted too ?_**
Moreover since the activity list can’t be deleted (nor a time window can be choosen) the list gets longer and longer. Ok.does’nt matter, but since the thumbnails are apparently saved on mobile device they need memory on my device (though only little). The longer the server is runnung ( and the the activity-list increases) the more memory of mobile device is used.
Is that normal behavior ? 

### Expected behaviour
-When pictures/photos are cleared the thumbnails should be removed too.

There is only one thing which is little bit annoying:
Very often the upload and deletion is already performed when i want to review the media files on my phone (with familiy members, friends, ....) and it is a bit clumsy to reach these medias...

Therefore it will be great to have the possibility to delay the deletion of the media files if the are already uploaded after a certain amount of days.

nextcloud/android,open,syncing problem,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour:
**_When I used android nextcloud-app earlier it worked fine. Now I have problems:_**
First -In local lan (only using http) : When I select a menu-item like 'favorites' (and choosing this, the error always happens using http in lan!) in the app-menu then the screen shows 'Loading.....' and don't stop showing this message -but nothing happens until I manually do an update (by wiping down on the screen).
When I do this, it seems that that strange behavior spread over on other menu items: Seems to sync or is updating but nothing happens. And when I choose 'photos' the pictures sometimes are shown twice !
Only when I start the app and choose ' all files' -menu item and do not leave this , the behavior is normal ! 
Second- using https and accessing server from lan as well as from wan (via dynDNS) the behavior is similar (although menu item 'favorites' seems to work here most of time). But in menu item 'photos' pictures are also shown twice. When I manually update (wiping down on handy screen) then each picture is listet only once (normal).  To sum up : The **_problem seems to be the app menu_** in the app ! Browsing the menu and choosing a menu item in the list sometimes causes the strange behavior. When I start app and only choose item 'all files' and do not change  this menu item there are no problems.

Comment: Auto-upload doesn't work too !

### Expected behaviour:
The sync should take only a few seconds and the updated files should be shown correctly  .. even after browsing the menu (like Cirrus-app does!).

nextcloud/android,open,One server offline prevents upload to any account,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I have two accounts added to the android app, from two separate Nextcloud server instances. If I attempt to upload a file (via the 'share to' feature of android) when one of the servers is down, the upload to the working (online) server instance will never happen.

Aside from this, attempts to upload when I have two accounts are never guaranteed, it is extremely unreliable.

### Expected behaviour
-The file should upload successfully and consistently, regardless of whether another, unrelated server instance is down.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Have two accounts added to the app from separate server instances
2. Have one server offline
3. Try to upload a file via the 'share to' feature to the server instance which is online
4. Observe the notification area icons never appear, uploads always fail
5. Remove the account of the server which is offline
6. Attempt an upload again, observe the app functioning correctly

Note that even when both servers are up, uploading is very unreliable. I have developed a habit of dwelling in a particular folder prior to tapping ""upload"" as it seems to give an upload more chance of working.

### Environment data

### Logs
None are included as none contained anything for this issue, the upload simply did not occur. I went as far as adb logcat (log showed nothing after the upload action) and packet sniffing with tcpdump, but due to the use of HTTPS nothing useful could be gleaned.

Folder ""Photos"" under ""All files"" (left menu bar selection) shows several jpeg images in the list.

""Photos"" (left menu bar selection) does not display anything, the application waits forever.

Android app runs with cs-CZ locale, so the menu items are ""Vsechny soubory""/""All Files"" and ""Fotky""/""Photos"". Server-side homedir includes ""Photos"" folder (dirname was not translated by the user or server).

### Expected behaviour
The application does not wait for server data and (hopefully) displays something relevant.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open nextcloud app on android
2. Open left menu
3. Touch ""Photos"" item (left menu, 4th item)
4. Application waits for some data and nothing comes

nextcloud/android,closed,"Local DNS server ignored: IP address connection works, hostname connection shaky",[],"### Actual behaviour
When attempting to connect to my local network hosted server (lets call it **myserver.localdomain, ip address: 192.168.1.100**): the nextcloud android client displays the following behavior:

- takes a very long time to connect: often says 'unable to connect', occasionally connects
- even when it connects (after multiple attempts to get it to do so), and I login: loading the folders/files takes a very long time.  File downloads fail citing connection issues.
- the server itself has redis caching enabled: if I load the nextcloud on google chrome on the same phone running nextcloud client: everything is snappy.

As soon as I switch to using the ip address (using the hostname/ip address I listed above for the example), I get the following behavior:
https://192.168.1.100/nextcloud - everything works **very well**.  Login is instantaneous, file/directory listings are instantaneous
https://myserver.localdomain/nextcloud - very problematic connection behavior

**As a sidenote: please note that there is no problem in the linux and windows desktop clients, only in the android one.**

### Expected behaviour
My phone and android tablet are both running on the local network, and are using the local router for dns name resolutions.  There should be the exact same behavior for accessing the local (but not public to internet) domain names as for accessing via I.P. address.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Host nextcloud on a local server with a made-up domain name (that does not exist in the internet).  Make sure the local dns server (usually wifi router) resolves this name.  In my case: my router resolves <hostname>.<domainname I set in router> for each new host that connects to it.
2. Access it from nextcloud client using the local hostname: problematic behavior
3. Access it from the browser using the same hostname: behavior is fine
4. Access it from nextcloud client using the hardcoded ip address: behavior is fine

but according to the stackoverflow answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42282526/6166726)
we should rename the values folder to values-es-b+es+419.

- Logging-in after switching from stable to e2e is taking about 2 minutes
- Uploading each file tooks about 2 minutes (sitting at 0%, then uploading in few seconds up to 100 - even to non-encrypted folders)
- Inability to encrypt a new folder because the key password isn't accepted (even after re-install of the app)

With the new dev version based on master we always have users who test our latest master versions, so we can hopefully get errors and bug reports more recent.
So I suggest that we release 
- every 2 months a stable version, currently 2.x
     - branch off from master, publish RC1
     - new PRs can be merged into master while stabilizing 
     - wait 1 week and if not publish it as stable
- if needed a minor version 2.x.y
     - fix bug on master
     - backport it to 2.x branch 

With 2 months as a (short) cycle we can ensure that not too much new is into it, so we hopefully have only 1-2 RC.

I havent looked through the source to find out what the keypair is used for but this doesnt look good. I can see they keyfiles are generated in PushUtils.java and are seemingly used to push some sort of registration token to the OwnCloud server.

I highly recommend storing these somewhere else. I'd be happy to provide a patch for this. Since the keys are seemingly only used for a single operation it would be trivial to simply store them in a more appropriate location and either keep them there or delete them after use since it doesnt seem like they are used more than once."

When using Android's native file choosing application in a device with the Nextcloud app installed, the option is given to select files from the Nextcloud account, however images show up without any thumbnail, unlike if they are in another source like Google drive.

### Expected behaviour
Thumbnails show up when browsing images on the Nextcloud account via the Android file selector.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Install NC app with access to an account with images
2. Navigate to any webpage that let's you select an image to upload and click the button to do so
3. When the file selector comes up, choose Nextcloud as the source and navigate to the Nextcloud folder with your images

nextcloud/android,open,"Nexcloud Android ""Account"" disappears after reboot, when nextcloud app has been moved to sdcard, sdcard formatted as internal storage (Android 6.0)","[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
Took me a while to narrow down...

As Nextcloud's Android account are disappearing reproducible after each phone reboot, I have to ""grant access"" and enter server name and login credentials after each reboot. Somewhat annoying ;-)



### Expected behaviour
- Server name and Login credentials should be asked once and stored permanently. Android ""account"" type ""Nextcloud"" should ""survive"" reboots/shutdowns.
 
### Steps to reproduce
maybe a ""prerequisite"" for this bug, don't know:  My smartphone is encrypted.

Small internal storage (8GB), so 32GB sdcard added. 
pre-req 1:  sdcard formatted as internal storage !
pre-req 2: install nextcloud app 
pre-req 3: ""Change storage"" for Nextcloud app from ""Internal storage"" to sdcard. 

Again: sdcard is formatted as internal storage, all above done with native Android functionality.

1.  start nexcloud app
2.  enter server name and login credentials

all I need is working fine at this moment
remark: I can see an Android ""account"", type ""Nextcloud"", in my smartphone's system settings from this point on.

3.  reboot
4. Android ""account"" type ""Nextcloud"" is gone. Start at step 1 :-(

IMPORTANT: This bug ONLY happens, when Nextcloud app has been ""Change storage""-'d from ""Internal storage"" to sdcard. Which, in fact, is a necessity for smartphones with low internal memory. Esp. for Apps like the nextcloud app, which needs usually lot of smartphone's storage for offline synching etc.

REMARK: I found this bug also for other apps, as long as they're using Android ""accounts"", like German ""Onleihe"" App (which also need mass storage on the phone for downloaded media, and the German XING social network app. So I'm highly interested if this an app bug or maybe an Android bug.

You can enter the application without entering your fingerprint, even though the app is locked. This only works if the app is open and a notification (upload) is in your status bar. Clicking on that notification while inside the application will open the 'Upload' view.

1. Start an upload to your Nextcloud server via the application.

nextcloud/android,open,Frequent failure to upload/download even though server's fine (beta),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
There are a variety of symptoms, but essentially I can tell when it's started because automatic uploads just error out. Usually a notification says ""Could not complete operation. Server unavailable"" Occasionally it says ""Server in maintenance mode."" (It definitely isn't though.)

Downloads will also fail at this point eg. if I tap on a photo, the progress bar doesn't move past 0 and eventually I get a notification ""Could not download IMG_....jpg"".

However, the server is fine. I confirm this by visiting it in a browser, and if I forcible kill the Nextcloud app and restart it manually, everything suddenly works. This suggests to me it's the app that's the problem, not the server.

### Expected behaviour
Network operations work if the server and internet are fine.
 
### Steps to reproduce
For me, it happens pretty much once a day. I might have a heap of photos waiting to be uploaded (automatically), and it'll fall over on the last ten or so. Not sure beyond that.

nextcloud/android,open,Trigger sync/download/upload,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
There is no such methodology available

### Expected behaviour
Some form of lightweight class/snippet to trigger a sync/download/upload. This way apps could trigger re-sync of existing or custom files from Nextcloud. Because of often not-reacting Auto-Upload of this app, and the coming changes in Android O+ I think it would be a good idea to have some sort of outside trigger available to hint  the official Nextcloud app to do it's work, and especially sync specified file(s).

My example is [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor), which edits local files, in this case a file inside Nextcloud: `NCROOT/todo.txt`, which is tagged `offline available` and `favourite`. Still, somehow it doesn't sync accordingly in background, always have to start NC app to see if it is really latest version. In O+ there may be no way for Nextcloud app to run in background (or at least at the right time when something has changed in between), so sending a resync-Intent with an path extra to trigger a forced sync would be very helpful. NC app could than e.g. send a broadcast/intent back in return.

Tell me if there are open questions, the description sounds quite complicated currently :D.

 External SD access should be available. 

Some Android apps on Chromebook are able to access the external SD card and some aren't - I don't understand the underlying tech but here's the Chrome bug report thread (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=660189) which provides a link to what I think is the solution (https://developer.android.com/training/articles/scoped-directory-access.html#removable) though again I don't know for sure.

Given that Android is now out of beta on Chromebooks, having Nextcloud use the External SD card would be hugely helpful.

nextcloud/android,open,Auto upload - file not found event if it exists,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I'm using auto upload in Nextcloud 2.0.0 for several folders since a few days ago. One folder is the one that contains screenshots. Most of the uploads from the different folders have worked well (both custom folders (expert mode) and folders suggested by the app). But one screenshot image is not uploaded. Instead the Nextcloud app tries to upload it but then says ""File not found"" in the list under ""Uploads"" in the menu (could be something similar to ""file not found"" since I use another language). But the file is in the screenshots folder and Nextcloud shows a thumbnail of it. Retried several times. This is not a ""custom folder"" but a folder suggested by the app for auto upload.

### Expected behaviour
Nextcloud should not mark a file that exists as ""file not found"" but instead upload all files that actually exists in the auto upload folder in question.

nextcloud/android,open,Auto upload overwrites existing files,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I have enabled auto upload on my camera images and also enabled option that the files are moved from camera to NextCloud.

Now I discovered that if my images start at DSC_0001.JPG then after moving the next photo taken is named the same and when uploaded to NextCloud folder, it will not be named as ""DSC_0001 (1).JPG"" as was done in previous releases, but it will overwrite existing file.

For instance, I have now in my previous month's folder image DSC_0001.JPG with 10 different versions. I guess I will eventually lose data because some versions will be automatically removed by some internal clean-up logic, right?

### Expected behaviour
Duplicate files should be uploaded with a different name.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Enable auto upload of DCIM/100ANDRO folder for instance.
2. Set option ""Original file will be... "" to ""moved to app folder""
3. Create new photo, let it be uploaded/moved to NextCloud
4. Create another photo that will be named the same as the previous one, let it be uploaded/moved to NextCloud

In this case, it's for manually upload (to stop the log, i've to force the stop of the app)

### Logs
- To debug i've added log system in nextcloud config.php at 0 level
- Here this is the lastest log. You can see ""IMG_20171101_082125%20(411).jpg"" and the 411 is incrementing every second, as if it's a try number.
- Mobile is the destination directory.

nextcloud/android,closed,Search function causes restart of the app for users with many files,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Steps to reproduce
1. open the application use the Search Icon
2. enter a search value
3. use return to start the search process

[Youtube Screen Capture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViJy0jXK48E)

### Expected behaviour
The application show the search results, and show the wanted files.

### Actual behaviour
The application is automatically closed and restarted. 
If i close the application and delete cache, i can once successful reach the file.
I create into the same Nextcloud Instance a new User, with less files available. The search function works.

### Additional
I activate the expert mode and can see the protocol function. 
However even after the crash, no log is generated, so I can not provide an error log.

nextcloud/android,closed,Resized images - updated,[],"Successor of #69, rebased and updated to master.

What it does, copied from the ownCloud repo and heavily discussed there, so here just a CR:
- Clicking on an image loads a reduced version to the cache.
- The width and height is determinated by the screen.
- the benefit is a very small, but yet usable preview of the image.
- it can be used to send via whatsapp, or as a file to another app (like k9) with the correct filename.
- resized images are not treated as downloaded files. If the user wants to have the real file, he has to long-click and select download.
- clicking on an image shows first a square thumbnail (if available) until the resized image is loaded

**ToDo**
- [x] test with disabled API (gallery app)
  - test if thumbnails api can be used -> not possible right now
- [x] Unsupported image formats https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/1599#issuecomment-229400874
  - [x] svg
  - [x] tiff
- [x] Bad preview of landscape images https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/1599#issuecomment-229406324 [WIP]
- [x] sharing a non-downloaded image on Android N fails (at least with whatsapp)
- [x] sharing a non-cached resized image fails -> first download resized version
- [x] a resized image should load immediately (first on queue or dismiss all other current downloads)
- [x] ~~download of a resized image also with a nice download animation on the bottom?~~
- [x] snackbar is sometimes beneath virtual keys
- [x] ~~if resized version show ""sending resized image"" otherwise ""send"" (as it is  now)~~
- [x] test with disabled data
  - [x] show resized image if available
  - [x] show thumbnail if resized image not available
  - [x] show (something smart) if both is not available -> default image icon
- [x] on air plane mode: snackbar is shown all the time as resized download files -> prior check of connection

Assumptions:
- users do not want to download the whole image, instead just like streaming have only a resized version
- if an user wants to have many images in original quality, he can synchronize the folder

This leads us to
- always show a resized version
- if an user zooms in (> 2x) a snackbar ""download full image: yes"" will be shown (on every time)
- (to have the old behaviour: add setting ""click on image downloads full image"" (as checkbox))

Update: Talked to Jan @conf:
- behaviour setting can be removed
- otherwise approved"

If I try to connect with the nextcloud app to my server it fails with a timeout without any traces in the error-log. Connecting with firefox/chrome on android was no problem.

My server has a domain like vm.myhost.mydomain. In the nameserver there was a valid ip4 registered to this domain and an invalid ip6.

After deletion of the invalid ipv6 for the domain everything was fine.

It took me weeks to detect the problem because other apps run fine with my server. It would be nice if the app would report that I have a valid ip4 and an invalid ip6.

nextcloud/android,open,"Server Unavailable, but webserver shows requests with status 200 or 404","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour

I'm trying to upload my photos to my PC on the local network (gmtp doesn't work - don't ask). NC dev fails with ""Server unavailable"", but when I navigate the app, many requests are shown from my phone - the only client - with benign status codes. Files are not being uploaded after having uploaded ~1100 (out of ~6500). When I am trying to search the file mentioned below, 20160322_154857.jpg, in the web interface, it is not there, so the 404 is expected by me, but I'd rather expect the app to upload the file.

### Expected behaviour

I expect that local folders are being scanned and then all files which are not present on the server, are being uploaded (I configured Auto Upload for these local folders).

Since the latest update of the Nextcloud app, it seems to repeatedly flash notifications for fractions of a second.

The notification shows up as both, a notification itcon on the top left corner of the screen as well as a ""proper"" notification bar across the screen that shows up when the phone is locked.

The flash is so short, that it is impossible to see the content. The notification bar doesn't even complete its animation before disappearing. However, the icon is shown just long enough to make out the Nextcloud logo.

When I ""force stop"" the Nextcloud app, the flashes disappear. When I then launch the app again, the flashes start again.

Because the new Auto Upload overwrites files on the server (https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1685), users think this is unwanted behaviour. Unfortunately this is indeed INTENDED - if you modify a file, you should get a file uploaded. And CREATE + DELETE + CREATE == modification.

In general, I think we should not touch the files outside our Nc data folder so I would suggest we completely eliminate Auto Upload behaviours."

nextcloud/android,open,NC 2.0.0RC8: Battery being drained while phone doesn't have internet access,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
While being away, I had trouble getting reliable internet access, it seems my http connection was working but everything related to https was being blocked.
Browsing with Firefox was not a problem but NC and Gmail were no go.
So in absence of connection, NC, but possibly SMS app linked to my server seemed to being the culprit in taking my phone down in a matter of a few hours. 4 or 5 hours seemed to be the time required to drain my phone from a full charge.
I came to the point where I disabled WiFi altogether but even that didn't stop the battery from being drained.

nextcloud/android,open,Issue with certificate while traveling,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
I just came from a trip and at the hotel I wanted to get access to the WiFi. I had the required credential to get WiFi up and running, but I have noticed the following:

- I was able to connect to the WiFi access point but I need to enter the credential to access the Internet (which I didn't do right away) because the signin pages is to slow to popup.
- I then start NC and upon starting it, I get a dialog requesting to accept or decline the certificate. At this point NC believes it has to update the certificate which is not true as the certificate on my server and my NC account on the phone have not been updated.

- For me to access NC, I have to enter the credential for the access point.
- I can then access NC.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
 NC shouldn't mess with the certificate when it is connected to an access point without Internet access. Internet access should be available once credential of the access point are specified.

The export function doesn't work well. I can't download the file on my device. It seems the bug comes from the type MIME misdetected when the extension is in uppercase.

### Expected behaviour
When I click the export link, Android should suggest me to copy the file on my device.

To make it look more in line with the Nextcloud style, here’s some detail fixes:
- [x] The big headings should not repeat the small detail timestamp. The first one is »Today« (if any), followed by »Yesterday« (if any), followed by the date like »Saturday, October 7«, then »Friday, October 6« etc and so on (also include the year as soon as the event history goes to last year)
- [x] The links should have no underline, bolding is enough
- [x] The link color can be black instead of the Nextcloud blue / primary color as it looks quite out of place. What do you think @nextcloud/android?
- [x] In the web interface we have 50% opacity on all of the action icons on the left since they are a bit too overpowering otherwise.

```
warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class
(freemarker.ext.beans.MapModel$1) that doesn't come with an
associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
and without specifying any ""-target"" type options. The consequence of ignoring
this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
indicate that it is *not* an inner class.

I would be glad to have some of your thoughts about my issue.
Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

N.

### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
The android client doesn't download some types of files (.pdf/.doc/.txt/...). The problem seems to be related to ""text files"", the videos, pictures and sounds are downloaded correctly.
It also seems to be a problem from my server, I tried to use NextCloud's demo  account on the app and the files got downloaded correctly.

Everything works fine with the Windows client or the webui and the encryption isn't enabled.

I used to have this issue on my ownCloud server before installing NextCloud from scratch hoping to fix it.

This issue seems to be related to this thread [#347](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/347) 

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
 The client should open every type of files.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open android's Nextcloud client
2. Add a new account with the following credential 
>Server address : https://durst-webmaster.fr/cloud
Username : test
Password : **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
3. Try to download Nextcloud Manual

nextcloud/android,closed,"Add option to undo ""remove failed uploads"" if selected accidentally",[],"### Actual behaviour
- If an upload fails for whatever reason and ""remove failed uploads"" is tapped accidentally instead of ""restart failed uploads"", there is no easy way to revert this operation. Instead all failed uploads have to be found (no list or anything, which means it is very difficult if it happens for a lot of files) and selected by hand for uploading.

### Expected behaviour
- An undo button (maybe at the bottom) should be shown like Nextcloud does everywhere else because it is good UI/UX design.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Generate an upload that fails (enabling instant upload and taking a picture with the camera while losing connection for example)
2. Retry to upload the image but instead accidentally tap the ""remove failed uploads"" in the menu instead of ""retry failed uploads"""

nextcloud/android,closed,double uploads,[],"### Actual behaviour
i only have my camera folder set-up so it auto-syncs to my nextcloud-server (only wlan) splitted into pics and videos (seperated dirs server) but some images and videos are uploaded/copied to the instant-upload-folder (""SofortUpload/Camera""), and then uploaded / synced too, which is REALLY annoying.
Since we are 6 people/phones and even more desktop-endpoints in my house using this feature (syncing) you can understand, that this gets really critical in terms of wasted space. 

### Expected behaviour
it should catch new files in the camery-folder, seperate pics and videos and transfer them to the server when wlan is on 
 
re-installing didn't help, since from what i read here, the settings et.al never gets deleted, but since i use this app from the very beginning, it might have corrupted some settings while i took updates i was offered (in fact g-play does that automagically for me in the background).

My Nextcloud instance runs on CentOS 7 with yum-cron for automatic updates.

Last friday my external storage stopped working, it seems a new samba was rolled out in centos 7 and it requires the use of domain\username and not just username.

Adding the domain for shares with global stored credentials worked, however, it does not work when the option 'log-in credentials save in session' is used. I cannot add a domain there (option missing). And my users log on via webdav and can't add it either.

nextcloud/android,closed,Using theme utils instead of custom implementation for color fallback,[],"resolves  #1551

the code wasn't error-prone if the background image wasn't empty or a valid URL the code tried to parse it as color which should always fail and the proper fallback is to use the primary color and do that via theme utils which also has a fallback to the Nc color in case the theme's color is corrupt.

This is a 2.0.0RC crash so it should be part of the 2.0.0 final.

The actual feature to auto upload files on folders is very good, but I think it can miss a little option or function.

Is there any way to add an option to tell nextcloud app to check if there are missing files on the server, to upload missing files ?

For example, I create the sync for my camera folder, but only new files will be uploaded, not old ones already present on my phone.

If we can had a sort of real replication can be very very usefull (and not only for pictures), maybe like a simple ""one shot"" button to tell ""upload missing files"".

By the way I'm talking only for a one way replication (android to server).

### Expected behaviour
The app should create an account (on my android device).  At the least provide a normal user some feed back as to why the app is crashing or can't create an android account (even if this isn't the nextcloud app's fault - see below). 
 
### Steps to reproduce
Apologies, I've had with so many flippin problems with this app (note this issue will happen on the non-dev version) that I'm no longer sure how I got here and going off on it will likely not be helpful...

Likely I got here along the lines described in the response ""answered Jun 20 '16 at 16:06 hiBrianLee"" to
this post:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37406666/accountmanager-does-not-add-custom-account-in-android-n-preview

See also: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/820

This problem has not happened (to me) if the nextcloud account entry on the android device is preserved during an update event.

Again apologies if this has already been reported and a fix is forthcoming... I'd sure like to know about it.

Nextcloud server version:12.0.0, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-93-generic x86_64), TOPT enabled, https only, redirected from DDNS service at a high port that is redirected to port 443 by my router.  

This configuration has worked for many months prior to this event.  

FWIW, this problem does not happen (I could create an account on the android device) when on my own network and using the ip address of the server without port redirection.  

The mysql table oc_bruteforce_attempts had entry's but this problem persisted after I removed them and restarted the nextcloud server.  In any event, it seems like an android account creation problem to me - see below.

### Logs
A connection is made to my server and an ""app password"" is created by the android app on the nextcloud server.  The nextcloud app apparently crashes/resets after that.  logcat on the android device indicates the account already exists on the android device similar to that described in the post:

https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/820

Examination of the files: /data/system/sync/accounts.xml and /data/system_de/0/accounts_de.db (pulled from the android device while in recovery) showed no nextcloud accounts; however, four nextcloud accounts entries from prior attempts to troubleshoot this were in /data/system_ce/0/accounts_ce.db.  Removing the nextcloud entries from the accounts_ce.db file and pushing the modified version back to the device fixes the issue.

nextcloud/android,closed,Music files downloaded not showing in stock music player,[],"### Actual behaviour
Shows Album Cover´s in the Nextcloud Player, but it doesn´t show the covers in the android player.

### Expected behaviour
Should show the cover in the nextcloud player and also in the android music player.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Uploaded files (.m4a) from Itunes via Web (no App) into the cloud.
2. Downloaded via ""Sync"" order of the music folder.
3. When i open the music file in the nc app it shows the covers, but when I open offline the file via music player no album cover is shown.

nextcloud/android,closed,Delaying upload if device is in power save mode,[],"This change adds handling for uploads from device when it is operating in power save mode and is part of the fix for #1277. In those case, uploads are behaving similar as if upload requires Wi-Fi (or that device needs to be charging) and those conditions are not met - they are delayed until device exits power save mode. Same thing holds true for contacts backup and explicit uploads - they are not delayed. Difference with Wi-Fi (and charging) conditions is in that 1) this delay cannot be set per synced folder and 2) it is turned on by default. For devices that don't have this capability (API level < 21) - old behavior (backward-compatible) is used; they behave as this check is not present.

Also added is listener for power save mode, albeit it makes sense only if user explicitly turns off power save mode while it is in it, as putting device to be charged will restart all jobs already by design (another listener that already exists)."

nextcloud/android,closed,Footer text wrong in languages with multiple plurals,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
OCFileListFragment.generateFooterText doesn't honor languages with multiple plurals. In those languages, translations are limited (and wrong). For example, ""file_list__footer__files"" is not plural resource and as such, will not make sense in those languages

Use plural resource to show files and folders in footer. Ideally, logic of this method could be simplified greatly.

1. Change language of phone to language with multiple plurals (Serbian is example I know)
2. Notice that generated translations are nonsensical and weird

> How do you clean up preference entries once say a folder dissappears?:)

Well, first of all, I would evaluate if that's really an issue.
If it's really an issue, I then would ask the person who wrote isGridViewPreferred, what his evaluation was, and how he intended to solve it if at all. :)

If I had to solve it, I tend to use a database having foreign keys and constraints available. So, in case a folder gets removed, we only need to remove all sort-entries for all users of that particular folder.
Folder ids also have the benefit of being path-unrelated. So, less hassle for a user, if he moves some dirs.

My preliminary evaluation tends to ""it's not an issue"". I cannot imagine that those few bytes are a problem at all. Take this with a grain of salt, as I am new to the project, I might mis-estimate here.

########

Talking practically, it might not be an issue. Talking good design, it is an issue.

As for Arbitrary Data ... yes, it was one of the ideas behind it. You'd basically have ""sort_13245"" (as an example, where 13245 is folder ID) as a key, and value as the actual sort preference.

I would not mind moving layout preferences to Arbitrary Data as well ... ""layout_12345"" and then ""grid""/""list"" as value. Wishful thinking? :)

nextcloud/android,closed,fix display of empty activities/notifications,[],see #1477 
nextcloud/android,closed,Integration with office apps,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
Office files are opened in read-only mode by the official Microsoft Office Android apps (Excel etc.)

### Expected behaviour
Office files are opened in read/write mode with the possibility to save changes directly to the server again
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. In any of the MS Office android apps choose 'Open' and then 'Other Cloud Storage'. 
2. From there select Nextcloud and then browse to any office file in your nextcloud account.
3. Now the file is being downloaded and opens in the Office app - in Read-Only mode.


### Environment data

Device model: H60-L04

Nextcloud app version: 1.4.3

Nextcloud server version:12.02

I am not sure whether this is a server issue or an issue in the nextcloud app. The latter could be because the app is first downloading the file instead of providing the office app with a 'cloud version' of the file (i.e. webdav link or something).

nextcloud/android,closed,User account corrupts - 2.0.0-RC[2345],"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Set up new installation of Nextcloud client on phone
- Connect to nextcloud server with username and password
- User account as shown in app changes from full name & username, to GUID & GUID
- App crashes

### Expected behaviour
- User account remains as showing username, instead of GUID
- No app crashes
 
### Steps to reproduce

This has been totally reproducible for me, with every 2.0.0 RC so far.

1.4.2 from F-Droid works fine.

1. Fresh install of application (RC4) after uninstalling previous in order to clear data
2. First-run wizard comes up; I successfully provide hostname, username and password and log in to my Nextcloud server (version 10.0 if that makes a difference)
3. Look at list of accounts, it shows up with two lines (top line: Firstname Lastname, bottom line: username@owncloudhostname) and my photo, as I’d expect - so far, all good. Clicking the drop-down here, and choosing ""Manage Accounts"" shows me the same detail at this point.
5. I go and do something else on my phone. Could be anything -I even tried just clicking on a different activity in the NextCloud client (e.g. ""Activities"")
6. When I come back into nextcloud (I have literally not done anything else in the nextcloud app yet) I look at the list of accounts in the app. Both my full name and my username have been replaced with my GUID and my photo is gone
6. I go to “manage accounts”, and do not click on any accounts.
7. In the list, my one account (with GUID now) is shown
8. I wait a short while. Nextcloud then crashes (“Nextcloud has stopped / Open App Again / Send Feedback”

nextcloud/android,open,Feature request: work auto upload settings into wizard,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Currently setting up the NC app doesn't prompt the user to setup auto upload by default, leaving them to find it once they've finished signing in.

It'd likely require some rejigging, but having a prompt after sign-in to setup auto-upload would prompt users immediately to start backing up their photos/documents. Turning this into a post-login mini-wizard with how it works et al would be potentially useful too.

A rough example of a call to action:

nextcloud/android,closed,Autoupload moves/deletes files too early,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""high""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Auto-upload, configured to move files to the app folder, sometimes deletes files taken by the camera app before the application that has triggered the intent got a chance to do something with them (e.g., share with contact).

### Expected behaviour
- Auto-upload is triggered after the intent-calling app is finished with the file. 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Use, e.g., https://github.com/siacs/conversations, choose `Attach file`/`Take picture`
2. Take a picture and accept; Conversations offers the file to the recipient
3. Meanwhile, Nextcloud starts auto-uploading the file
4. If the file has finished uploading before the contact has accepted the file, the file will get moved by Nextcloud, and the transfer in Conversations will fail, saying that the file is missing.

I applaud the time spent in developing this application and I know is easy to just complain, but the new icons to me are still not ok.
1. just a check mark does not identify which application is that
2. the icon is HUGE! in fact is so big that the top and bottom has 0px in Ubuntu top bar, is just huge, something you would expect to see in a UI that is optimised for your grandparents.
While I do understand in the past was too small, I would say too big is also not that good... A compromise has to be taken to have a good design and a pleasing application to use.

This is how it is showing up, to me it is completely non professional and not appealing:

### Expected behaviour
To address the 2 points above I would suggest to have a compromise where first the icons have to be scaled down a bit.
Second, why don't take the idea of what the green icon I have in above screen shot does and use a variation of that with what we had before, the original logo image where we could use a cropped version of before and after circles but in a horizontal line instead of 45 degrees the green icon has them. Yes it will make the icon smaller but I guess it will still be acceptable?

When I open a pdf document in the Android Nextcloud app it opens a ""window"" where I can choose between 8 different apps to open the PDF document with.

-Tell us what should happen

It should offer me a way to set one of the readers as my default choice so that another time I skips the choice and opens PDF documents directly in the chosen viewer.

For comparison, opening a PDF document in Dropbox defaults to open the document in the embedded Dropbox PDF viewer.  Similarly with Google Drive and the Drive PDF viewer, so somehow it must be possible for an app to pick a default viewer.

causing line:

My guess is that ```getAppContext()``` returns null since the underlying variable hasn't been initialized yet. A quick fix would be to add a try catch and return the default value which will cause problems for custom/branded clients who run into the NPE fallback then...

After testing a few days with the NC beta app from the Play store, there is one annoying bug:

I have my auto-upload set to function on wifi only, with no charger limitations.
Whenever you connect to a wifi network that is captive-portaled, the app doesn't wait until internet connectivity is made via wifi, but just starts uploading via 4G, pending the [OK] on the captive portal.

### Expected behaviour
Autoupload should only send data over Wifi, like configured
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Download beta app from Play Store and configure basic settings
2. Enable auto-upload, Enable 'Only upload on Wi-Fi' in preferences for auto uploading
3, Add new content tot the selected folder (in my case: Take a picture)
4. Connect phone to a captive-portal enabled network (in my case: Railway transport public network in NL)
5. Upload seems to start upon association to Wi-Fi, but Wi-Fi is then still a limited network (little exclamation mark next to the Wi-Fi symbol)

When trying to log in the applications screen remains blank forever just after tapping on right arrow icon next to the server address.

### Steps to reproduce
1. install Dev/RC version
2. open, skip to the input of server address
3. input server address and tap right-arrow icon

### Comment
This behavior occurs with my Nextcloud server at the web address where the Startcom SSL certificate is issued to. The same server is accessible under another address (where the certificate isn't issued to). When trying to log into the server using this address a warning message appears asking me if I want to trust this certificate anyway. After affirmation all seems fine, the app works as expected (asking for grant access and login credentials).
When I go back at this point and try to use a the ""right web address"" instead a second time, this time it works also with this address.

nextcloud/android,open,Instant picture upload subfolder naming,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens

Naming convention:
yyyy = Year in digit
mm = Month in digit
dd = Day of the month in digit
Condition: 
Settings - Use subfolders - yes

With uploading pictures to the choosen upload folder a subfolder yyyy is generated and a subfolder thereof  mm and the picture file is put into this folder. Which results in
InstantUpload/yyyy/mm/filename (= InstantUpload/2019/08/20180801-140303.jpg)
This does create multiple mm folders (same name) with different content in different years. 

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen

 The naming of the subfolder(s) should be configurable with a selectable given pattern.
Then according to the need of the user a pattern like
InstantUpload/yyyy/yyyymm/ (= InstantUpload/2018/201808/)
or
InstantUpload/yyyy/yyyymm/yyyymmdd/ (=InstantUpload/2018/201808/20180801/)
would be possible.

This would integrate with other picture management software.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Setting - subfolders - yes
2. Take a picture
3. Verify the folder structure in InstantUpload

nextcloud/android,open,Force new scan of not permitted files,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
Checks recently changes on the folders which be autouploaded.

### Expected behaviour
It works fine, I think it´s there to save some battery life, and if you want to instantly upload you can force there a new scan. I´m right? That the reason, why it isn´t added intanlty to the upload tasker, is it?
With the new version I deleted accidentally some upload task. Now I don´t know the deleted filename and it would be nice, that you can press a button in the section of the Autouploadssettings that not only forces the recently data to be synced, rather the whole autoupload folder. So old files can be detected, that wasn´t be uploaded.
So you have a battery life save button in the upload tasks (to upoad recent files) and a sync checker in the autouploadssettings, that takes not permitted files to the upload tasker.

EDIT: Another Idea, you can suggest this only at the start for new user with the whats new screen ;)

nextcloud/android,open,"Auto uploads UI feedback (Beta version) - empty camera directory not shown, separate media types confusing","[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","Just some feedback re. the UI for auto uploads in the beta version (ping @mario). I'm referring to the part of the auto-upload interface that features:

- An icon that can be a picture or a camera
- An outline cloud with a line through it that becomes a filled in blue cloud icon
- A preview of the media in the folder

For the most part this was a pretty intuitive interface for me, but the big ""gotcha"" was that it only shows up for already-populated directories and it's not obvious that it's only for one media type. So for example

- If you're setting it up on a new phone, it won't show the camera directory at all. It's only after you take a picture or video that you can enable auto-uploads, and then the existing files (that are *required* to make the UI visible!) won't be part of the auto-uploads. In an ideal world ( 🙄 ) there'd be a permanent setting that's just labelled ""Your Camera Media"" that always tracks the configured camera directory, even if it changes. There'd also be an option to ""prime"" the uploads with existing media. Again, I don't know if that's possible given Android permissions.

- This was the most confusing thing for me: at first I had pictures in my camera directory but no videos. In this situation, it's not at all clear that the little ""photo"" icon *only means photos will be synced!* Because there's nothing to compare it to! In other places in Android, the same icon can mean all camera media (eg. the gallery icon is usually just a stylised picture in a frame). So I enabled auto-uploads, but then videos didn't upload, and when I went back to the settings I realised what had happened. ...And then I had to sync the existing videos manually.

On the plus side, I *really* like the automatic sorting by year/month, and the automatic deletion, and I'll just reiterate that I've been using it pretty heavily for the last couple of weeks and I've never had a photo or video fail to upload eventually 👍

nextcloud/android,closed,NC Dev 20170810: Auto uploads issue while recording.,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
I was trying the newer ""Auto upload"" feature while recording a video ion excess of 20minutes.
At the end of the recording, the video file .mp4 in the Upload folder was believed to be only 17MB in size, but the true file is actually 3BG.
I started the recording from home so I had direct access to the server over Wifi.
I have noticed so performance issues related to the upload process.
For instance, NC would say that upload is in progress but there was no activity on the network side. ( I am using Network Monitor Mini to check the throughput.
There was no activity for a solid few minutes. Phone was getting hot and at times would become unresponsive.
Then later during the day ( being at work) , the file got finally uploaded. The upload summary still indicates the files as being only 17MB, but the files on the server seems to be there in it's full content.
While the file seems to have been uploaded properly, It seems to have been initiated too many times after a few failed attempts.
It seems the auto upload process is not resilient enough and cause NC Dev to become too responsive.

nextcloud/android,closed,Connection Problems with uploads,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
I got a Huawei Y6 2017 (MYA-L41, Android 6.0) and it gets errors while uploading .mp4 files or image files.
I took a little trick to get uploaded all old pictures with my new smartphone. I set up the sync for Camera, unmounted my SD-Card and remounted it, so that my device needs to upload all old pictures from my old smartphone.  I know there will be duplicated uploads, but i decided  to upload all files, to delete later the duplications to be sure that all files are in the cloud. Now after hundreds of fileuploads, some files won´t be uploaded and I haven´t yet restartet the raspberry pi. But i got some hints in the logs. My old device has got the same hints, but he hasn´t got many problems like my new Huawei smartphone.
### Expected behaviour
-Should just upload my shit!
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Anyway if I renew my upload task list with a umount/mount command from the synced folder or if I manually add old pictures to the upload task list, there should be no different.
2. Using Pi with Pihole, idk if the actual destination is within his own subnets and doesn’t route the requests into the Internet.
3. A friend flooded the table oc_bruteforce_attempts, becaus he has got revoked his old App of his old Smartphone. The old Smartphone was also in the Wlan like mine. So it blocked my uploads, too. I empty the table with phpmyadmin, but I get these error sometimes. Sometime I think it´s overheating of the Pi, but when I connect with mobile connection the upload works great.

nextcloud/android,closed,Can't open files with 3rd party apps,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
I'm not sure if this is related to issue #751. I'm unable to open files at all, not just read-only, so I think this is a different issue. I've tried PDFs (I have Google Drive pdf viewer app), jpg files, and my KeePass database. jpg files work, but appear to be using a jpg viewer built into Nextcloud app. PDFs and my KeePass database don't open, with different errors. I don't have any problems opening these file types from the Dropbox app, but I'd like to get away from using that service.

### Expected behaviour
-I expect Nextcloud app should launch the appropriate 3rd party app to view/edit the file (and then if there's changes to the file, synchronize those, but I'd be happy if they just open).
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Find a PDF file. Click on it.
2. Wait for it to download. 
3. ""Can't open file"" is displayed. Click close.
4. Check the box ""Set as available offline. A sprite shows ""File contents already synchronized""
5. Press back. Notice the file has a green checkmark.
6. Click the file again.
7. ""Can't open file."" is displayed.

I can use a 3rd party file manager and browse to /storage/SD-CARD-NAME/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files/...../FILENAME.pdf and it opens just fine.

1. Find a *.kdb file (keepass 1.x database)
2. Click on it.
3. After it downloads a sprite displays ""KeePassDroid cannot handle this uri"".
3. Check the box ""Set as available offline"". A sprite shows ""File contents already synchronized"".
4. Press back. Notice the file has a green checkmark.
5. Click the file again.
6. A sprite displays ""KeePassDroid cannot handle this uri"".

I can manually open KeePassDroid and then browse to /storage/SD-CARD-NAME/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files/...../FILENAME.kdb and it opens read-only.

- On Android app, thumbnail display is very long.

- I think app doesn't use thumbnails create by preview generator (NC12), so NC must generate 256x256 thumbnail. It's too bad, because Preview Generator already create 256 thumb.

nextcloud/android,open,AutoUpload: retry button in the notification drawer,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
When auto upload fails e.g. when Nextcloud server is only available on the LAN there is a sync error message in the notification drawer. 

### Expected behaviour
As mentioned by @mario here https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/797#issuecomment-319997004 it could be an idea for future releases to offer the user (maybe in expert mode only) a retry button in the notification drawer. In that case a resync can be started immediately without waiting for next sync interval and without opening the app and trigger resync in expert mode. 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Use a Nextcloud sever that is available only on the LAN.  
2. Enable Auto upload for camera folder
3. Leave WiFi
4. Take a picture with the phones camera.
5. Sync will fail. 
6. Imagine you are in a hurry and need to leave home/office immediately to catch the bus. You have to open the app, enable expert mode in settings, then got to Uploads Menu, click the three dots and trigger a forced sync.

nextcloud/android,open,NC Dev 20170802: Trying to change server address fails,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
I am experimenting with a server located on my LAN. I had it setup not to support https so I was logging only with http://.
I now have setup a SSL certificate and I need to update the server address on my phone.
Upon reconnecting to the server NC Dev prompted me with a certificate request approval. I accepted it, but to make sure I got the proper ""App Password"" I decided to delete it from the server.
Because the ""App Password"" no longer exist, NC Dev is crashing, but then I am able to regain control of NC Dev,
Trying to change the password, I am presented with the server address which is based on http://.
I cannot edit the address and change http:// into https://.
The only way to go by is to delete the account and start fresh.

One nasty side effect, is that unless Data and Wifi are disabled, NC Dev will force a switch to the server configuration page, which prevent user account switch, deletion or creation.


### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
I should be able to edit the server address to make proper correction.
Alos, the switch to edit server correction should not be forced upon. Instead it should allow for account managemenrt capability.

nextcloud/android,closed,(Dev version) Uploads not resumed after aeroplane mode or reboot,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload"")]","### Actual behaviour
- After queuing up some uploads and toggling aeroplane mode, the upload queue is not resumed.

### Expected behaviour
- Uploads should resume when a connection is available.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Manually upload a large amount of files comprising a large amount of data (in my case about 50 files, photos and videos, 4.5GB in total).
2. Wait for a few files to upload (screenshot 01).
3. Enable aeroplane mode. The uploads will stop.
4. Disable aeroplane mode. The uploads will remain stopped (screenshot 02).
5. Wait a few minutes. Soft-reboot the phone.
6. Wait a few more minutes. Launch Nextcloud app. Uploads list show queued uploads with ""app terminated"" status (screenshot 03).
7. Open the ""recent apps"" list, swipe to close Nextcloud. Re-launch Nextcloud. *Now* the uploads resume (screenshot 04).

I can manually upload pictures to my Nextcloud instance. However, Auto-Upload does not work. Pictures get queued and the app tries to upload them, but in the Queue view it is shown as ""failed"".

nextcloud/android,closed,NC Dev 20170723: App password improvement during account setup.,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
Upon adding an account multiple time on the same phone (following reinstall).
When using the normal login process, NC Dev will generate an App password based on the phone model or name.
If an App password was previously generated from the same devices (or less likely having more than one of the same device using the same account), NC Dev seems to always create the app password with the same description. 
It would be good to have extra info added to the description so as to manage the correct app password for the corresponding device.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
If an app password is created by NC12 server without a name or description, the server will take care of that by entering some date and time info.
NC Dev creates the app password based only on the phone name and/or model number even with an app password already exist with that name.
NC Dev should be able to create a different App password with a name or description which doesn't already exist.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Reinstall NC Dev 20170723 or remove account on devices
2. Add account using normal login.
3. Upon account creation, app password would have been created on server.
4. Go to App password section of the server. Multiple instance of the same app password name exist.

Last night, after an issue, I had to uninstall NC Dev. Upon reinstalling it, I couldn't find the ""Download"" folder from the category anymore.

nextcloud/android,open,Request: Folder and file share classification improvement,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
When folders or files have the same name across accounts, and one or more of those files and folders are shared, the name of the folder of file will be have a ""(N)"" N being a number chosen by NC (incremental value it seems).
If I have a Document on one account and share it with another account, the name on the second account would be ""Document (2)"".
From the user who was given access to the share, it is not evident to say the share is from another account, nor from whom the share came from. 
Under NC Dev 20170721, it doesn't even seem possible to know who provided the share.
For security and privacy reasons, and to prevent saving files in the wrong account, it would be really nice if the name of the file or folder containing the name of the person or group the share originated from. Instead of using the ""(N)"" designation, maybe ""(username)"" or for a group, the ""Groupname"".
To prevent such confusion with ""Autoupload"" default folder name, I usually add ""_username"" at the folder so I would get ""Instantupload_username"".
I find this approach makes sharing and receiving shares clearer to read and process.

This is the same behaviour as on 1.4.3. I tried to improve this, but did not succeed. So this is basically to get a proper message back, but is not the best possible UX.

nextcloud/android,closed,Nextcloud Dev 20170718: Thumbnails are not persistent.,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""dev version""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
In grid view, visualizing a folder with pictures, the thumbnails start getting updated, but the update process may cause the same image to toggle from icon to image thumbnail a few times before stabilizing.
Upon scrolling up or down, the pictures will not retain their thumbnail and revert back to icons. Waiting a little bit and the thumbnail will refresh.
This is very similar to
https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/596

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
 Thumbnail should be persistent.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Open any folder contianing images.
2. Select grid view
3. scroll up and dwon within the folder.

-Tell us what happens
Trying to add a second account on Nexctloud Dev, fails.
The Add account page now only included the ""server address https://"" line. The Account and password filed are no longer present.
When entering the server address and clicking on the right pointing arrow, the ""Testing connection"" shows up briefly and  Nexctloud is updating the display with a blank page. Normaly, the page would show the certificate details and would provide the user with a choice.
From this point on, nothing can be done and adding account is not possible.

As this was an update, I am not sure if the issue would be reproducible with no account yet.

nextcloud/android,closed,delayed removal of auto-uploaded files after certain time #enhancement,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Images should get automatically uploaded (they are not im my case, but that's a different story ;))
- There is only an option to remove the images right after successful upload

### Expected behaviour
- Allow specifying a duration for wich successfully auto-uploaded files (images/videos) are kept, before they will get automatically removed. The idea is to provide a ""delayed removal"" option instead of the existing ""instantly remove after successful upload"" option.
- The delay should be customizable (probably best in days (and/or maybe hours for some folks)).
- If set to 0, this means instant removal (like the current setting allows)
- So you once setup this delay, which will then applied to all newly auto-uploaded files. With this option set, this will allow to automatically remove and cleanup all successfully auto-uploaded files after a certain time-span
(eg like count-down for each uploaded file (or batch of files) and once the count-down expires (counted down to 0), the file(s) get automatically (and silently) removed from the smartphones storage space.

### Why?
* Cleanup, regain disk-space.
* At the same time allow to still /use/ recent photos eg. by sharing them without having to re-download them from the nextcloud server :/
* Also privacy to some extend: Because like this I can assure that someone grabbing my phone only gets direct access to x days of personal photos.

### Environment data
Nextcloud app version: v.1.4.3

### Related issues
See also #1146 which also has the goal of cleanup of storage-space, but with a not time-based approach and rather on-demand and/or storage space related triggers.

In hotspot mode the phones internet connection is 4g! Nextcloud should not assume that  wifi is connected.

This would remove the requirement to switch to a browser from the Nextcloud app instead of listing and displaying them directly inside the official Nextcloud app.

The old calendar 0.x is discontinued!

https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues
-->
### Steps to reproduce
1. While having folders checked for synchronization - unknown problems arise, and for some odd reason synchronization stops (as i have seen a number of times) then normal troubleshooting starts - are there blocked files on the server - delete them on server - these files are not re-uploaded once back to normal and next time the android client syncs the folder from where the picture or file came from.
You may even chose to delete the account on the device, and recreate it - then no more files older that the date of the creation of the account are uploaded - no matter if the files are on the server or not
2. Normally synchronization picks up again if you manually tags a file for upload to server, but all new files arrived since the stop of sync until manual upload will not never synced.
3.i am sure there are other scenarios, where files on the device are left un-uploaded

### Expected behaviour
At next scan the non-uploaded files should be detected, and uploaded, but for the case where a file was purposely deleted via the web interface on the server, it creates a conflict - should this file be re-uploaded or not - rather not i would say. But sometimes you just wish to make sure, that the complete folder marked for sync on the phone IS on the %é_è-'çàçe(bloody) server.
Therefore the need for a ""redo complete deep dive sync of folders marked for sync"" ""with/without overwrite"" of existing files (the overwrite could be interesting in case of corruption on the server (sd card about to hang up, cryptolock etc)

### Actual behaviour
not possible to get missing files onto the server once sync has decided to omit them, unless finding out yourself which files are missing, and manually tagging them for upload

New system instead uploading images, it watches for new files in a folder and uploads them [folders] to `InstantUpload/.` When I use subfolders, the new system uploads pictures to:

* /InstantUpload/DCIM/2017/06 or:
* /InstantUpload/Pictures/2017/06 when the old system was uploading everything to:
* /InstantUpload/2017/06

the behaviour is inconsistent and breaks user experience. Personally I much preferred upload taken pictures feature, as it was camera-app agnostic. I was able to upload pictures from OpenCamera and LG Camera (great burst-photo functionality) independently. Pictures and videos from both app were uploaded to the same directory. With the new system I had to configure two different folders to observe and I still ended up with two different directories with **new** pictures, which I have to manually merge with my old folders.

Previous system was much better organised and required less user actions to successfully organise images."

I would for the second one.
If an user wants to have an item of the upload queue ""forced"" uploaded (by omitting the requirements) we can add a long press click with ""instant upload""."

nextcloud/android,open,"Uploading pictures with ""Google Photos"" via share doesn't work.","[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
I just installed ""Google Photos"" app on my cellphone to debug issues my friend is having.
This new issue targets both Nextcloud 1.4.3 and Nextcloud Dev 20170602, but the Dev version doesn't work at all.

Issue with Nextcloud 1.4.3:

With a few pictures available in ""Google Photos"", I select a few of them, then click the ""Share"" logo.
I am given a choice of application. I choose ""Nexctloud"".
I select the format to be either ""LArge size"" or ""Actual size"".
A progress bar will appear indicating how many files are being downloaded.
If the files are not on the device, they will be downloaded (I believe the folder they are going to be stored at is the ""Download"" folder). When all the files have been downloaded, Nextloud app will appear asking for the folder to upload to. I use the pin to access Nextcloud.
I select my folder then press Upload. Upon pressing the button, ""Google Photos"" appears.
Background uploading of the pictures by Nextcloud starts.
The problem is that not all pictures are being uploaded.
At a minimum, it seems consitstent at uploading one pictures per share request.
However, when selecting more than one pictures, I could only get at most 3 pictures uploaded by Nextcloud.
My friend was able to upload a larger number of files, but was always missing a few.



### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
Nextcloud should be able to upload the entire selection provided by ""Google Photos"" and not skip a few files. 

### Steps to reproduce
1. Have ""Google Photos"" app installed.
2. Have a few pictures available in ""Google Photos""
3. Select a few pictures (max of 200) 
4. Click the ""Share"" icon
5. Select ""Nextcloud"" within the list of apps.
6. Enter PIN number, select relevant Nextcloud account if more than one installed within app.
7. Select where to upload the files.
8. Press ""Upload"" and wait for transfer to complete.
9. Check files are properly uploaded on Nextcloud server. They will not.

nextcloud/android,open,FR: Notification of pending uploads ala dropbox,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Feature request:
Would it be possible to get a notification of pending uploads in the android notification area, similar to the way in which dropbox handles it?
eg. with dropbox, if a file is modified it shows at the top with a notification to say that an upload is pending.

The only reason I suggest this is because when files are changed on android it's not always obvious that anything is going to be uploaded. This stopped me from using the old owncloud app a long time ago because I'd end up forgetting about it and not connecting to wifi, then later getting conflicts without realising and losing work."

-Tell us what happens
Under both version of Nextcloud 1.4.3 and Nextcloud Dev 20170529, I find the ""On device"" feature to be pretty much useless.
The reason is that the folders are always displayed, even though their content may have not been downloaded yet.
I think it would be more informative to only show folders which have been synchronized and containing files. If the folder is not synchronized, ie. not containing downloaded files, then the folder should not be made visible.
To an extent, it would be nice to have the ability to visualize all the files either broken down per folder or as a single diaporama or catalog where the app would decend into each folder and create a list such as every files present on the storage media are browseable with a swipe. This can be define as an option similar to list view and ""Grid view"".

nextcloud/android,closed,"Nextcloud Dev 20170529: ""Favorites"" and ""Shared"" menu not working.",[],"### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
I don't know if the following status are still work i progress or simply not working due to bugs:

- ""Favorites""
- ""Shared""

Right now, when I access the ""Favorites"" menu, I get a short message that looks like:
""Nothing Favorited yet"" (improper English I believe) then follows the spinning ""Loading"" semi-circle, and ends with ""No files here- Upload some content or sync with your devices""

Same drill with the ""shared"" menu.

PS: As I was breaking down the steps to report this issue, I left my phone in the ""Shared"" menu. After a while I saw some activity and the display went from ""No files fere"" to showing a list of the files and folders being shared.
Investigating the issue further, it will take at least a minute before the content gets updated. In the meantime, ""No files here"" remains. If I swiped the screen down, it refreshes with ""Nothing shared yet"".
As I am waiting, there seem to be chunks of data being downloaded, at around 10KB/s.
I suspect each burst of data is a portion of the list being downloaded.
As I was performing the test, Nextcloud Dev, crashed a few times.

Pressing the ""..."" on the right top corner of the display, and switch between ""Grid view"" and ""List view"" a few times will populate the list incrementally.
The content doesn't seem to exist in the cache as soon as the screen is being refreshed, the content will instantly disappear.
The feature is not very stable to be useful, I think.
According to the Web interface, I have about 100 folders and 100 files shared for my account.

It seems ""Favorites"" never gets updated, though, I have 2 folders and 8 files set as favorites.

nextcloud/android,closed,unnecessary and confusing content-descriptions in file activity,"[Label(name=""accessibility""), Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
In the main file and folder activity, every file or folder name has a contend description set which prepends the layout type to the file name. For example if you have a file named testfile.txt in your Nextcloud, the contend-description for this entry is ""LinearLayout-testfile..txt"".

The purpose of content-descriptions is to add text descriptions for graphical UI elements such as image buttons. This information is then used e.g. by screen readers such as Talkback which enables blind or visually impaired users to work with the app by utilizing text-to-speech or braille displays.

When using the Nextcloud app together with Talkback, talkback reads the content description instead of the visible file name as described above, which is quite annoying and confusing. 

Since file and folder names consist of text, there is no need for them to have content-descriptions at all. Funny enough, there are also graphical buttons in the same activity i.e. to create a new folder, which are graphical only and would need contend-descriptions to be announced in a meaningful way, but don't have them set. I will however open a separate issue for this.

I am not a Java coder, but by looking into the code it seems to me the content-descriptions have been set mainly to use them in automation testing, not considering end users also see this information in some cases.

### Expected behaviour
Content-descriptions should only be set where needed to add textual descriptions for graphical elements. Furthermore the contained information must be valuable and informative to the end user.

### Steps to reproduce
Either use debugging tools to view the content-descriptions or enable Talkback from the assistive technologies screen in the global android settings and try to navigate the Nextcloud app. Be warned however talkback changes the touchscreen behaviour, which is confusing for sighted persons. When touching an element, no action is performed, instead the touched element is beeing read via text-to-speech. To actually trigger the focussed element, you need to double-tab it.

Sometimes later this can also be enhanced to (hopefully) change colors dynamically if set on theming app on server, for all users.

Icons that are now changed:
- folder (shared, linked, regular)
- empty list icon
- auto upload cloud icon (only on checked state)
- checkbox (only on checked state)
- primary action buttons"

nextcloud/android,closed,Drawer branding,[],"if you right now try to change the drawer icon for e.g. ""backup contacts"" it will also change all user icons across the app.

-if an icon is only used in drawer, I have renamed it to be more consistent
-if an icon is also used somewhere else, I have copied the icon so that you can have in independent change of drawer only

nextcloud/android,closed,Contacts restore option in newer phone not available,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
-The user with device ""X"" select the option backup contacts, then the same user with the same account opens the app in device 'Y', the restore option is not showing

### Expected behaviour
-When a user moves from device X to Y expects to restore contacts.
*Maybe the option `Last backup` its ok to see it as `never` because this configuration belongs to the current device. 
**Edit: It works if i browse in the `/.Contacts-Backup/` folder  

### Steps to reproduce
1. From device X select the option backup contacts
2. From device Y open the backup activity, restore option is not available

nextcloud/android,closed,Contact backup first time crashes,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Select backup contacts for the _first time_ ( press button back up now ) application crashes

### Expected behaviour
- Contact backup file uploads to server. 

If it helps the problem is that the method `expireFiles` tries to get the folder `/.Contacts-Backup/` before it´s creation in the `CreateFolderOperation`
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open app
2. Select back up contacts menu
3. Press the button backup now
4. Wait until the service starts

- When trying to share an image (*.JPG) via the ""send"" function to a WhatsApp contact then the error ""unsupported file format"" gets thrown within WhatsApp. Also other messaging applications are failing to send the image.
- If I direct access the nextcloud data folder with some other file browser app I can successfully send the image so the image itself is ok.

### Expected behaviour
- Image should have been shared with WhatsApp so that it can be send to one of the WhatsApp contacts.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open image
2. Select ""send"" in the options
3. Select WhatsApp (or some other app)

nextcloud/android,open,Improve offline support,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- NextCloud server is not reachable (offline) and mobile is connected to WIFI. Now when trying to use the app to open an image that has been marked as ""offline available"" and that has this green check mark it takes quite some time (several seconds) to open the image. Overall the app becomes very unresponsive especially if you're in the image preview mode.

### Expected behaviour
- If an image has been downloaded onto the mobile and if the server is not reachable it should immediately show the image that has been stored on the mobile and don't wait that long for the server to respond
- Also the app's responsiveness shouldn't drop when the server is not reachable
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Mark via the folder view an image (in my case 4.5 MB) as ""offline available"" and wait until the green check mark appears (do not yet open the image)
2. Close the app
3. Take the server offline
4. Re-open the app and try opening the previous downloaded image (takes very long / much longer than usual)
5. Try opening the image info options (very unresponsive)

nextcloud/android,open,Support direct rendering from server to Chromecast,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Let me tell you a story 😊 

Mrs. Peabody wants to display pictures to her parents. She currently uses Google Photos. Opens the app, turns on the TV+Chromecast, presses the cast button, and pictures & videos show on the TV as she swipes on them in her phone. She has some 60fps videos from her last snowboarding holidays and the video renders perfectly smooth in TV (a little low-res at the beginning until buffer catches up, but nobody notices).

Mr. Peabody wants to move from Google to Nextcloud - for obvious reasons -, but cannot do that until his wife is able to show pictures to her parents in the TV comfortably. This includes:

- 1 button press to cast.
- Direct nextcloud-to-chromecast streaming, or the video will not display smoothly.
- Pics & videos should be correctly sorted.
- Swiping to next media should cast it automatically.

Right now only screen mirroring works, but it's clunky.

Can we help Mr. Peabody?

### Actual behaviour
- No Chromecast icon.
- Video is downloaded instead of played (https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/379).

### Expected behaviour
- Chromecast icon on screen when casting is possible.
- When casting is on, media streamed directly from nextcloud server."

When the android app is generating/loading thumbnails, I click on an image (even one with a thumbnail already generated).  When the download progress bar completes, the app shows a Loading spinner and gets stuck loading.

If I Force Close and restart the app and navigate to the same folder and stay in a section where all the thumbnails are already generated, pictures load just fine.

### Expected behaviour
Pictures should download, loading screen should show (I assume) and the picture should become visible when the app is finished loading
 
### Steps to reproduce incorrect behavior
1. Enter Photos folder
2. Scroll to section with missing thumbnails and wait for the app to start generating thumbnails.
3. Click on a picture to start loading (this can be a picture that's already cached on the phone.  It doesn't matter which picture)
4. Wait for the picture to finish downloading and the white Loading spinner screen appears.  That's where it gets stuck!

### Steps to reproduce expected behavior
1. Enter Photos folder
2. Keep grid scrolling position in an area where all thumbnails are already generated.  (None need to be generated)
3. Click on a picture to start loading (this can be a picture that's already cached on the phone.  It doesn't matter which picture)
4. Picture loads just fine!  Almost instantly after the download process.

The main clue is that the current system does not allow to have ""any"" ocfile, instead there must always be a parentId/parentFolder. Without that things like downloading files do not work.
As the favorites/photos can show any files (even if they have never been synced) we need to download the parentOCFile, maybe even recursive until ""/"".
Of course this is only done once for each folder.

nextcloud/android,closed,propose instant image/video upload make use of file's last modified time,[],"Propose instant image/video upload make use of file's last modified time rather than datetime as of upload trigger

Summary:
the changes is to respect and retain an image/video file's last modified time (i.e. mtime) of itself.

Description:
Uses of System.currentTimeMillis() as of upload triggered are not guaranteeing the truth of last modification datetime about users' uploaded data.

Uses of Media.DATE_MODIFIED are seemingly more appropriate for the usage.

==========
For example:
Consider that 
1. USER_A captured a screenshot at 2017-04-25 1800HKT, a photo at 2017-04-25 1900HKT, a video at 2017-04-25 2000HKT
2. USER_A then connected the android phone to a stable WiFi network at 2017-04-26 1200HKT, which enables Nextcloud android app to trigger those pending auto-upload/backup jobs

==========
Currently unexpected result:
USER_A will be told by Nextcloud that the uploaded files are all last modified on/at 2017-04-26 1200HKT

==========
Expected result:
Nextcloud should tell users an exact truth about last modification time of an uploaded file.

e.g.:
USER_A should be told by Nextcloud that the uploaded screenshot is last modified on/at 2017-04-25 1800HKT, the uploaded photo is last modified on/at 2017-04-25 1900HKT, the uploaded video is last modified on/at 2017-04-25 2000HKT.

==========
Other discussions:
1. comments are polluting the clean code but I temporarily write down comments to explain my changes for sack of facilitating others to review my changes. pls remove it after reviews if feeling uncomfortable.
2. File Upload Datetime Timestamp is also considerably important information for users to get an understanding about their uploaded file when users revisit their files. For file_upload_datetime_timestamp, uses of System.currentTimeMillis() (as of file upload trigger/completion at client/server) would be suitable to the usage. Should it be considered to be implemented in a planned future? Besides, considered that, file upload is async task, where a progress of file upload could be taking a lengthly upload duration, say probably an hour long for big video file over a slow network, take file upload completion timestamp at server as reference for file_upload_datetime_timestamp may be considerably more logical to usage? I think that could be discussed.


Thanks for your attentions!"

nextcloud/android,closed,Can't pause pinned-offline audio when server is unavailable,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""dev version"")]","STR:

1. Upload some audio to a Nextcloud server
2. Pin the audio offline in the app'
3. Make the server unavailable (in my case it's down; not sure what the behavior is when you just take the device offline)
4. Tap the audio file to play it
5. Notice how you now get a screen that says ""Loading"" which prevents you from using the audio controls and which will never load because the server's down

I'm on Nextcloud dev 20170419 installed via F-Droid. This is definitely a regression but I'm not 100% sure what version I was on before - presumably it was 20170415, the previous version, but again I'm not sure.

nextcloud/android,open,Create new text file from within NC,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi everybody and thank your for this app!

What I am missing is a simple way to create a new text file from within the NC app.

If you want to do it today, there are severals steps necessary:
- open your favorite text editor, write text and save it to a new local file
- open NC app, navigate to the destination folder
- click on ""add"" buttton (""+"") at the bottom right
- click on the first upload button
- navigate through your local files and select the desired text file
- choose ""move to next cloud"" and click on ""upload""

What I would suggest is to add a ""add text file"" button to this small menu (sorry for my bad gimp skills):

first of all, thank you for this great software suite!

Right now the add-button opens a menu with icons, which is imho not self explaining. The upper two symbols (upload file and upload from external app) would also fit the other way around. You have to do try and error to know, which one is what for:

What I would suggest is to take the same icon twice, only with a small difference. I am not a designer, so sorry for the quality of this small gimp project. But perhaps something like this:

Imho it would be clearer, as it is something people know from the differentiation between ""open"" and ""open with"" buttons.

nextcloud/android,closed,Nextcloud Dev 20170415: clicking on a thumbnail downloads the file.,[],"### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
On Nextcloud Beta, there was the ability of clicking on a thumbnail of a photo and be able to display the thumbnail in full screen. At the same time, it was also possible to scroll through the photos without downloading the files themselves. This was a nice feature to have as the downloading the picture was done in the background and when download was complete, the thumbanil in the scroll mode would show the full size image.

Should we expect Nextcloud Dev to have the same behavior found in Beta?

When Autoupload is enabled for Camera folder,  video file being recorded will become corrupted.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
 Nextcloud app should detect when the file has been finalized before moving ahead with the autoupload.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Have Autoupload for Camera to be enabled.
2. Open Camera app and take a video. I was running the test for the maximum length of recording which is 5 minutes on my phone.
3. Transfer is probably underway while video is in progress
4. File sent to server is truncated and damaged because it is incomplete. 107MB out of 600MB file would only be uploaded.

After installing ""Nexctloud Dev: 20170415"" the phone as been running warmer than usual.
While taking a video to test ""Autoupload"", I let the video being recorded for the full 5mintues, then on the second video being recorded, the camera app terminated the recording complaining the phone was getting too hot.
I don't know if Nextcloud Dev is doing some intensive work in the background trying to sync up with the server or there is bug  causing excessive CPU usage.

I take a photo.  It gets uploaded.  Later, I navigate on the same device to the directory under InstantUpload where the photo should be.  I see a large warning triangle and text that says that the image can not be shown.

If I check in the local folder where the file should be, I see that a file with the correct filename exists, but it has size zero bytes.

If I delete that file locally, the actual file can be downloaded from the server and viewed normally.

I would expect the photo to get downloaded from the server and displayed normally.

 
### Steps to reproduce
1.  Take a photo
2.  Wait for long enough for the auto upload to happen
3.  Check in the expected folder.

nextcloud/android,closed,Add further media types to auto upload,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","as discussed in #285 and numerous other issues, this PR adds further media types to the auto upload screen, starting with videos. For now video and images are split and shown twice for folders contain both e.g. the camera folder. We could also merge them into one (if we want that which is subject to discussion).

Audio is also on the agenda but I would leave it out for now until it is clear how to implement this. The reason for that is that we are querying the media store and then display all folders that contain images (and are visible to the media store, as-in indexed). So for music in case each album has it's won folder we would display all those folders which might be a lot while it does makes sense do handle it this way for video and images...

Onscreen Message when opening the files using the Nextcloud nightly android client: large black exclamation icon with the message ""Picture could not be displayed"" or with the MP4 movies i can open the MP4 file using the android nightly client but after 5 seconds it presents the following message: ""Media could not be displayed using the default mediaplayer"". The messages could be slightly different  because they are presented in an other language then English, being Dutch, which is the default language on my phone.
What is also strange is that other content (both pictures and Movies) uploaded using the stable android Nextcloud client are displayed correct by the Nextcloud nightly android client, listed individual iconized preview is displayed, and content uploaded bij the nextloud android stable client can be opened and played. The issue here is that I am not able to open or play Content uploaded by the Android nightly client using the nextloud android nightly client.  All Pictures which I am not able to open with the nightly Android client also have the same file icon: a grey icon with gray mountain tops and grey circle (sun?) for pictures. 

Also i noticed that, when I close the nightly Nextcloud android client en open the latest stable NextCloud android client, I can see the all the pictures being displayed correctly (listed miniatures preview icons) and i can also view and play both the pictures and the MP4 movies which i was not able to see and play using the, and uploaded by, the nightly Nextcloud android client.

nextcloud/android,closed,Improvement: arbitrary synced folders,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
- The defined folders sync fine. However, there doesn't seem to be a way to define a custom folder to autoupload (or sync) to the server.

### Expected behaviour
- I would like the ability to define a folder that is not just images or videos but other files to be automatically uploaded to the server.
- The client should monitor that folder (or even check every couple of minutes) if files have changed or have been added.
- When a file has been stable for a configurable time span, it gets uploaded to the associated folder on the server.
### Rationale
I'm running the GpxPod plugin on the server, my devices record GPX tracks when I'm using OSMAnd. I'd like to upload the generated tracks automatically. 

I can imagine there are other applications that generate data files that someone might want to upload, e.g. backup files from some application that isn't in the cloud.

nextcloud/android,closed,Remove Auto upload,[],"I posted this on Nextcloud site, but this is probably more appropriate.

I have recently updated my Samsung S7 to Android 7.0 and with it the Nextcloud app somehow also ""updated"".

The recent 1.4.2 update added the Auto upload feature, which I dislike very much. I do not want my Videos and Photo files to be going to the same directory. I cannot now separate the upload of video to wifi only. I want the pics to be uploaded at all times, while video only on wifi. 1.4.2 broke that. Before android 7.0 came out, I downgraded the nextcloud to 1.4.1 and restored the ability to upload separately. However, now that the system updated I ""gained"" the auto upload, no matter what I do. I even tried to downgrade to 1.4.0, and still see that retched auto upload feature.

So, my question is, how do I re-enable the ability to select separate folders for video and photo, AND the ability to upload different files over cellular or wifi?

Thank you,

nextcloud/android,open,API for other apps,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","User story: I as a NextCloud user, want to use all NextCloud features on Android.

So downloading multiple apps is fine (and you got many: OCReader; Notes, NextCloud itself, …), installing them is fine, but afterwards we get some problems…

### The problems
1. User experience: Currently in all apps I saw have to re-enter my credentials. If I want to make it in a secure way I even have to recreate device passwords for each app (see 2.1 below)… That's cumbersome.
2. Security:
2.1. Each apps stores passwords. The fact that you can (and should) use separate device/app passwords for all these apps mitigates the risk, but nevertheless the password storage may get a problem.
2.2. Another thing is the connection to the NextCloud server: Do all these apps verify HTTPS certs correctly? Do these apps honor HSTS? What about HPKP? What about SSLv3? What about insecure ciphers? Do all these apps have the option to distrust system certificates?
SSL (implementations) are a well-known and common issue on Android…

What I want to show is: Using multiple apps, which may be more or less maintained, which may be better in a security aspect or not, which may accidentally delete all your data and where each of them needs a login is (potentially) bad.
Even when all apps are open-source (which is not guaranteed as users might also use non-FLOSS apps) open-source does not equal to security. NextCloud should provide a secure platform, where third-parties can securely integrate their apps.

### Possibly solutions
* As for the first issue, something [is proposed](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes/issues/43) thanks to @David-Development [lib](https://github.com/David-Development/ownCloud-Account-Importer): Basically getting the user account from the saved one in Android accounts. However: This means the same password is used creating a potential security risk.
* or integrate all these third-party apps into the main NextCloud app. However: This requires much work, additional app permissions and will likely make the maintainers of the other apps sad.

### My proposed solution
…is therefore to create an API as the title indicates. Allow apps to connect to the main NextCloud app, where they can request permissions etc. All traffic (and therefore the SSL/TLS things) would be handled by one app - NextCloud - where you can include all security features etc. You can more easily expand/change the NextCloud system, especially the authentication.

### Examples
So how exactly could it be done? I've got two examples of other open source apps here:

* the way [K9 mail](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/) integrates the OpenPGP provider. They show an authentication screen.
* the way DAVDroid integrates with Open Tasks (via custom Android permissions).

updating to 1.4.2 (rc4 or release) creates battery drain when photo upload is selected and watching an sd card. the processes com.nextcloud.client, sdcard and mount.exfat eat up cpu resources

no significant resource usage as in previous versions 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. install 1.4.2
2. enable picture upload, wifi only, loads of pictures on sd card
3. use a process monitoring tool like better battery stats to loom at the processes

nextcloud/android,closed,Difference between Nextcloud Nightly and Nextcloud 1.4.2 RC1,[],"### Actual behaviour
I am at loss when it comes to understanding the roadmap and bug fixes between both version of Nextcloud app Nightly (Old Beta designation) and 1.4.2 RC1.
I have seen issues related to Autoupload under Nightly that were fixed under 1.4.2 RC1 but remains broken under Nightly.
Also not everything that has been improved, added or fixed in Nightly finds its way into 1.4.2 RC1.

I was under the impression Nightly was the next major release and would replace 1.4.2 after most bugs where fixed.

Can we get some lights to what is happening?
Is Nextcloud Nightly supposed to be incremental update for 1.4.2 RC1 or is it supposed to be targetting the next release.

I am just confused.

A branch has already been created here: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/tree/androidStudio23 for the ""code change"" while in order for this to work properly we also need to update the corresponding docker image which would also be part of the PR. The PR should then be for Release 1.5 or later leaving the build process of 1.4.2 untouched for stability reasons to not further slow down its release.

nextcloud/android,closed,Custom delete delay after Instant-Upload,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
I checked the option to delete pictures after upload. After upload files get immediately deleted

### Expected behaviour
Please add an option to specify a amount of time to wait before deleting the files after upload.
This doesn't have to be specific to a folder, can be a global option. The problem is, the deletion happens sometimes too fast, before I can preview the file. Such a option would be very nice.

Specific use case scenario: I create a screenshot of something, or download some pictures. Want it to be archived on my NextCloud, and don't need them on my device. Mostly I also want to share the stuff with a contact, or want to look at it. Because the auto delete happens mostly very fast, I often cannot view/open/share the file anymore.
As said above, I really like the feature of auto-deletion, and don't want to deactivate it. Adding a short delay for deleting - configurable if possible - would be really handsome.

nextcloud/android,closed,Only uploads of current account will be shown in upload,"[Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","With the really great bugfix of autoUpload @mario has changed the scope of the pending/successful/failed uploads in the upload pane.
The previous behaviour was to show all uploads, independent of the current used account. For each upload the targeted account is shown in the remote folder path.
Now (aka in the next version) the user would only see the uploads for the current account.

Two problems:
If an upload will fail the user sees a notification is shown in the top bar. After clicking on it the upload pane is shown, which might (or might not) show the failing upload, depending on the current account.

If a user wants to see if auto upload is working and he is using the ""wrong"" account he might think that the auto upload never works.

For me this is a real problem as we did not discussed this properly and it can lead to confusing users.

So my idea is to keep the UI behaviour the same as it is now (showing all uploads) and if we agree to do an account separation we should discuss how it can be done.

nextcloud/android,closed,"Beta 20170221: Improving ""Autoupload"" event.",[],"### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
Having ""Autoupload"" enabled for one or more folders will actually not take place until the""autoupload"" feature is being triggered.
There should be an option that can force ""Autoupload"" on any folder selected for Autouploads.
As a simple example, if we enable ""Autoupload"" on Camera folder, which already contains photos and videos, enabling ""Autoupload"" will not trigger the autoupload mechanism. Instead, it is waiting for a trigger event from camera. Only then will the folder be uploaded.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
There should be an option to force Autopload to process a folder even in the absence of the triggering event.

Nextcloud app should detect when the file has been finalized before moving ahead with the autoupload.


### Steps to reproduce
1. Have Autoupload for Camera to be enabled.
2. Set Original files will be... ""Moved to app folder""
3. Open Camera app and take a video. 10-20seconds should be enough.
4. Transfer is probably underway while video is in progress (I suspect start of video file has been moved) but recording is still in progress.

nextcloud/android,open,Implement Policies,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","In the fingerprint PR we had a little discussion about security. I mentioned safetynet and even though it was meant as a joke, now when i think about it it's actually not that stupid. In order to give admins more control about what users are allowed and have to do, I request to introduce policies that can be set by the admin. Those policies can be things like:
- require passcode or fingerprint authentication
- disable passcode fallback if fingerprint is is configured
- require safetynet to pass in order to use the app
- disable webdav (so safetynet actually makes sense)
- require device to have a pincode/unlock pattern etc. set
- disable access for old app versions

I think that would be a great benefit, especially when looking at how nextcloud is used in enterprises. Also when the password manager will finally be introduced, even in smaller setups such policies would be useful to force users to comply to company policies or just to make the own system safer.
However this would require a lot of changes and so I am asking for comments here if that feature is wanted and if there are any other options that should be added."

I suspect this wording was used so that ""remove from server"" and ""remove from device"" can be options in the dialog, but I think ""Delete from device"" is just as clear. 

As an added benefit, ""Delete"" is a lot more visually recognizable in the menu compared to ""Remove"", which is easy to mix up with ""Rename"".

Typically it'll look something like this: 

- Take lots of photos, or upload lots of files in one go
- Leave the app (home/app switch buttons, not back usually - so the app is ""open"" still)
- The notification bar shows the files uploading

### Steps to reproduce
1. Enable autoupload for any picture folder
2. Create / add photos to folder
3. See that app didn't upload anything

I enabled the settings below for pretty much every picture directory, e.g. Screenshots, Camera/DCIM, 9GAG. But neither of them are working. Doesn't matter if I take photo with camera, or make an screenshot. Nothing gets uploaded. I also don't get any notification for an upload try, and don't get an message in the upload view. The nextcloud app also definitely has (M-)Permissions granted to access those files.
Note that manual upload of files, and sharing files into the app works. At least for camera directory OwnCloud Instant Upload worked, with this one not even camera.
I tried it on 3 devices now and instant upload doesn't work on any of those devices.

I tried to get an logcat (`adb logcat -s com.nextcloud.client`) but there seems to be no logcat output, and no option to share error logs from the app (maybe another suggestion/feature).

nextcloud/android,open,"Extremely slow upload speed when using Android app (1.4.1), with latest Nextcloud (11.0.1) release","[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""high"")]","### Actual behaviour
All uploads performed from within the Android app are insanely slow when compared to doing the exact same operation from within a browser (also on Android, from the same network and using the same file)

Typically it takes around 10 minutes to upload a 5Gb file from our company network into the recently-established Nextcloud instance. From the Android app, however, this was left running for approx. 30 minutes, resulting in numerous chunks of files, consisting of 1Mb each, being left in the ../cache directory for the user and only made it to around 340Mb during this time before the upload was terminated. The files had to be manually removed on the server-side after cancelling the upload in the App. It appears that the connection is re-initiated for every 1Mb chunk, causing the slowdown.

This flaw makes the Android app completely unusable for this purpose; and the users are forced to use the regular web frontend instead.

### Expected behaviour
Uploads from within the app should perform the same as when done from within a browser (on the same device, and on the same WiFi network)

I would really like to see an option to remove this chunk-upload behaviour, as this does not occur when uploading from a browser, which places the uploaded file(s) into temporary files suffixed with ocTransferId<$transferid>.part on the correct location and bypasses the ../cache dir altogether.

From looking at previous tickets (last activity on Oct 2016) it appears that a temporary workaround was done to increase the chunk-size from 1 to 8-10Mb, but this does not seem to have made it into the release/stable branch yet. Nevertheless it should not need to chunk the files unless under very special circumstances, as we've not experienced issues when testing various hot-spots and uploading large(ish) files without issues.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Open Nextcloud Android app 
2. Select a file of 2Gb or larger size
3. Perform an upload and watch the uploading user's cache directory being flooded with ""-chunking-nnnnnnnnn-nn"" files of 1000Kb each while enjoying the upload speed of a 28.8kbps modem. ;)

nextcloud/android,open,"Autoupload ""Remote folder"" setup improvement","[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
Under Nexctloud app beta (20170204 and prior), setting up individual Autoupload ""Remote folder"" is a great idea.
However, I am not happy with the default ""InstantUpload"" as the primary folder. The reason is that I do share this folder with other people and it does appear under ""InstantUpload(2)"" and so forth. Thus is not very personal. So to alleviate this shortcoming, I have created a """"InstantUpload_my_account_name"" folder on my server.
Where it becomes messy is when I have to change the default ""remote folder"" location to my own. This is not so much the process that bothers me, but rather the inability to preserve the subfolder structure.
For instance, the default folder for the Camera folder would be set to ""InstantUpload/Camera"". Will trying to remap the ""Remote Folder"" to my own, I loose the ""/Camera"" subfolder.
For now it is not a problem as I do not mind having videos and picture from the camera into the same folder.
I might find some issues is with the other apps.
I use Whatsapp and if I remap the ""Remote Folder"" to mine, then I loose the ""/Whatsapp"" subfolder. If I want to retain it's hierarchy, I must enter the name manually.
I wish there was an option to relocate to a different top level folder and still preserve the child folder.
This should be done with a user prompt.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
 Upon remapping ""Remote Folder"" the app should request by providing a prompt to the user whether the child subfolder should be preserved and applied to the new folder.

1: Default folder location under ""Remote Folder is ""InstantUpload/Camera"".
2: I want to remap the location to ""InstantUpload_Olivier""
3: I should be asked if I want to preserve the folder structure and have instead ""InstantUpload_Olivier/Camera""
4-A: If YES, then ""InstantUpload_Olivier/Camera"" should be created
4-B: If NO, then ""InstantUpload_Olivier"" should be used.

This of course is a case by case procedue for every Autoupload source folder.

-Tell us what happens
When selecting a file for sharing, the application will present a popup window where user can be entered.
Once the user has been selected, there is an option to clear the keyword used in the search bar, so that another user can be added. This is fine.
However, the only way around to exiting this popup window is to press the back key on my phone. 
This requires like 4 or 5 key press before getting back to the file list.
It would be great to have an extra button available that will allow the window to be cleared once pressed.


### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
Once the user has been selected, the popup window should present another button giving the option to terminate the sharing process and return to the list of files.

1. Select one files only.
2. Select to share the one file.
3. Enter the user name to share with.
4. Accept the selection of the user.
5. ""Exit"" or ""Return to list"" button should be presented. It could also be presented at step 4 to save one keypad press.
6. The popup window should close and present the list of files as it was before.
7. Since only one file can be selected for sharing, and because the list of share is not relevant anymore as it was already presented, it would make sense to unselect the file automatically. This way the next file can be selected and shared if needed.

nextcloud/android,closed,Nextcloud beta 20170202: Passcode key fills entire screen,"[Label(name=""dev version"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
The new passcode window has much bigger keypad that it used to. On my phone, it almost occupies the entire display.
It seems I can get the smaller keypad version if I select the Back-softkey... button.
I think if keypad layout be chosen, I would rather give it a ""Settings"" option.
As of now, the bigger keypad is the default size presented but it is not persistent, meaning that on the next passcode entry, it would have reverted to its larger size.
In general, I do not like to have my fingers go past the upper portion of the scree because it is not easily done. For that I must hold the phone from one hand and type the code with the other.
The second reason is exposure to the outside world. With such area, it is easy to expose the code to outsiders because of the extra gesture needed.


### Expected behaviour

The option to select the keypad size should be done under ""settings"" and should be persistent rather than always displaying the larger version of the passcode then altering keypad everytime it is requested.

Trying to get access to ""Settings"" caused the dispplay to turn black, but some of the phone overlay such as network, time and others were still visible.
Nextcloud app would then return to the ""passcode"" page.
Once passcode entered, the ""error"" log would appear and upon deleting the log, the app would crash again.
I was able to send the log with my normal Nextcloud app version 1.4.1 which works concurrently on my phone.
I couldn't get pass the ""error"" log under Nextcloud Beta. My only option was to unsintall it from the phone.
During this issue, several things seemed to have happen so this makes troubleshooting more difficult:

- It seems there was a Google update in the process.
- I lost connection to the Nextcloud 11 server due to ""Brute force attack"" prevention. I don't know the cause of it, but one of my account, was causing the issue. Maybe one of the Nextcloud app had the wrong account password causing the loss of server connection. I know which account triggered the attack defense, as I logged to my Nextcloud server from a different IP address.

nextcloud/android,open,Need feedback on server connection,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens

I use ""Brute force attack"" prevention on the server running Nextcloud 11 and sometime it is triggered after several unsuccessful logins.
When Android app is running, it is not possible to tell whether the connection to the server is active.
I usually find those event by loging with the web interface, but it is not convenient.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
 It would be nice to have an indication connection to the server has been lost.

1. No step in particular except that the firewall will block the network IP.

nextcloud/android,closed,Rewrite auto upload,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""high"")]","Due to design flaws of FileObserver on Google side, and lacking implementations on the side of various vendors, the approach Auto Upload was using would never work - at least not in the way we were using it.

Unfortunately, some vendors decided to hide certain inotify events, and you could also never know when the file was finished writing to (CLOSE_WRITE isn't a 100% bulletproof solution).

To remedy the situation, I have rewritten a significant part of Auto Upload, and in the process made it available to Android 5+. In the future, I expect to adapt it to 4+ as well so nobody has to live with pain that is Instant Upload.

As such, this should fix 95% of our troubles with uploads we've had in the past.

I have tested this to the extent possible, and it seems to work quite good.

I appreciate any and all comments, reviews and constructive criticism on both the code and the functionality."

-  \>=40% of the internal storage available: set cache size to 5% of internal storage size of the device (cache is always in internal storage)
- < 40% of the internal storage available: set cache size to 10% of the remaining space available but at least 100MByte (which still gives you enough space for thumbnails and resized images)

While I can afford uploading photos immediately, even my pretty generous 6GB LTE volume does not allow to push 4k videos without wifi.
If this is really not possible right now - e.g. because the upload feature is supposed to be general and not limited to photos and videos - I suggest a file size threshold for immediate mobile-connection upload vs. wifi-only upload.

@tobiasKaminsky and I had a short discussion today how we could further fine tune the development process we have and came up with the following changes.

* If a PR is considered done (reviewed, tested and labeled to release) it shall be merged
* No upfront release planing (anymore), if a considerable amount of PRs has made it to master (5+) consider doing a release 
* Issues and PRs will be assigned to the next milestone right after merging (if no milestone is available, create one: (X.X.?)
* Issues and PRs are only prioritized via the labels (low, medium, high) to give a indication what is important at the moment
* As soon as a RC tag is done we freeze the master and done PRs are forbidden to be merged except for bugfixes introduced in the upcoming release's RCs 

If we realize that we did quite some larger PRs as in features then a already created milestone X.X.? can be renamed to X.?.0 to make it a feature release.

Hope I didn't explain it too complicated (it should be a simpler process than we already have today).

My suggestion:
- Remove All files and On device from the sidebar menu
- Add a footer on the page with a filter icon in the left corner which would open a filter page (and contain ""All files"" and ""On device"" (among others). Since filter is whole other issue, we'll discuss this elsewhere.
- The top menu items would be:

- Home (webdav root)
- Favorites 
- [Photos](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/556#issuecomment-273897162)

- Activities
- [Notifications](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/559)
- Uploads

- Settings
- Participate

I will open an issue for both activities and notifications separately, but maybe @karlitschek or @MorrisJobke can clarify the Photos - would it simply open a ""Photos"" directory (should the item be removed then if the user removes the dir) or will it show all photos on your instance? (in that case, I assume search API will be useful here - just need to know which extensions to use for searching).

My suggestion for changes:

- Under Manage account remove ""Reconnect"" (or the key icon, this option is not straightforward btw) and the trash icon 
- Once you click the name of the account, you get a user information screen and both options should be put in the options menu top right for consistency with the rest of the app

The reason for this change is that you can switch accounts already from the sidebar, so there's no point in having two places to do the same operation.

If you want to share a file over WhatsApp the 'share' menu item is of little help. Confusingly you have to use 'send'. This makes sense from a technical pov but not from and end user perspective.

### Expected behaviour
Share should allow you to share - tech details be damned. I suggest to show a share via nextcloud action as part of the standard android share menu..."

-Tell us what happens
This is more of an improvement, but can also be considered a bug.
Let's say Auto Upload or manual uploads are in progress. Then something wrong happens and the file being uploaded is stopped in it's track. Nextcloud app then output a ""Failed updload"" message, and it is the way it is supposed to happen. However, with the new retry mechanism, upload will eventually resume and all standing by uploads should complete. 
Upon completion, if all the files have been uploaded, then the ""Failed upload"" should be removed from the list, when the user log back on the phone.
I think the result should be transparent.

### Expected behaviour
-Tell us what should happen
When an upload fails and user is not logged-in the phone, then the message ""Failed upload"" is added to the status messages for the user to review during login.
However, if the transfer finally complete and everything is is order, then this ""Failed upload"" message should be removed from the status task. Maybe the message should update the status message saying maybe ""There were some failed uploads, but everything has been uploaded"" This is a mouthful, but something more concise should work too. If we go this route, then I could possibly think about when the uploads last took place, but I think this is too much information.

Currently it can happen that you descend into a subfolder and have to wait for the content (file name, size) to show.
The new idea is to:
- store all informations of all folders on an initial run
- sync periodical all data
 - compare folder by etag
 - if etag is the same => do nothing, else update its content

with this one would ""always"" have an up to date folder system.

While developing your application's views you might be specifying attributes in a view's artefact that are not necessary due to the nature of its parent. In this PR, those attributes were replaced by a comment.

I have made a previous validation of the changes and they seem correct.
Unfortunately the tool is not yet ready to change the file in a specific line and file comparison might be confusing when whitespace is not ignored.

nextcloud/android,open,Folder creation while not connected to server should be possible,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Actual behavior
-Tell us what happens
Manipulating or creating folders while offline is not possible.

### Expected behavior
-Tell us what should happen
When server is not reachable (ie. no Wifi), it is not possible to create a folder from within Nextcloud App.
It would be nice to be able to performs basic folder file transaction while being offline.
It would be nice to have the ability to create folders then assign files to be uploaded within the newly created folder.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Phone doesn't have Wifi enabled or connection to server is unavailble.
2. Selecting + icon to create a folder.
3. Enter folder name and press OK.
4.Error message pops-up: ""The operation couldn't be completed; server is unavailable.""

-Tell us what happens
When accessing the Auto upload settings, if Wifi is enabled and connection to server is valid, the pictures will not be displayed. Instead, an icon used as a place holder will be shown.
Disabling Wifi while application is running will force Nextloud app in displaying the previews.
It seems the pictures will eventually render after a long while.

### Expected behaviour

Pictures should be rendered fairly quickly no matter the state of Wifi.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Start with WiFi enabled.
2. Access Auto upload menu.
3. Pictures should be populated with photos, but only icons are present.
3 A. If photo showing, close app and restart it following above steps.

So far so good. 

But when I tried to exit the app in Adroid, I could not find any way to do so. No close button, no way to log out or anything. Even when I rebooted my phone Nextcloud would start logged in with the account I have on the Dell PC.This remains so, even when I shut down the Dell PC. The app keeps trying to synchronize with Nextcloud server even when it is unreachable.

This is not what I would expect. I would expect to be able to normally and a connection to the Nextcloud server and open a new connection, possibly logging on with a different account.

I know I'm new to all of this, but I think this is a bug in the Nextcloud app for Android.

### Actual behaviour
In settings, storage path says ""unkown"" by default. It can only be set to ""/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files"". No further options are available. This is unexpected behaviour.

Pictures synced with the nextcloud server are stored in the ""nextcloud"" folder, as long as this option is **not** changed from ""unknown"". The *are* visible in the stock Gallery App. This is the expected 
behaviour.

When ""Instant picture uploads"" is selected and ""Original file will be...moved to the app folder"", the picture is uploaded but **not** moved to the nextcloud folder on the device. This is unexpected behaviour.

Once the storage path is changed to the only available option ""/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files"", synced/downloaded pictures are **not displayed in the stock Gallery App** any more. This is unexpected behaviour.

Pictures made are still uploaded to the server but not moved to the storage path on the device.

### Expected behaviour
Default storage path should be displayed instead of ""unknown"". Be able to select a custom storage path. After selecting the storage path, picture files synced with nextcloud should still be visible via the stock Gallery App. Picture made should be moved to the app folder after successful upload.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Take picture
2. Wait for successful upload
3. Check picture location with any file manager on device - it still is in DCIM/Camera
4. Select ""/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.nextcloud.client/files"" as storage path
5. Display of media content (e.g. pictures) synced with nextcloud is broken, pictures are not displayed any more in the stock Gallery app.

nextcloud/android,open,Distinction between emblems and some options is not clear,"[Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","Device: Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini
OS: Cyanogenmod 13 (Android 6.0.1)
Server: OwnCloud 9.1.2
App: 1.4.0

I find the interface for the NextCloud app extremely confusing. I'll walk you through how I used it and where I tripped up.

I install the app, log in to my server, and open the settings to change local storage to be on my SD card. I go to ""All files"", navigate to a folder with pictures in it, and open a couple of pictures. When I go back to the folder, I see a green check mark on these photos. The [Android app manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/android/android_app.html#managing-files) says:

> Downloaded files are marked with a green arrow.

So far so good. I don't want them clogging up my storage though, so... what do I do now? I try long pressing on them, and this allows me to select it (and the other photo). There's an option to ""set available as offline"", but that seems redundant... they're already available offline. I try setting it and unsetting it anyway. Solid Explorer shows that they're still on my device. 

Question: Is there a way to get them off my device?

Question: Are they being kept in sync? One-way? Two-way? Just locally cached?

I also try going to the ""On device"" section of the app. It shows me *all* the root level folders on the server, even the ones where I haven't looked at anything! The manual has nothing on this topic.

Question: How can I just see the files that are on my device? How can I clear them?

So now I browse to a document I want to maintain on both my phone and the server... keep it in sync, you might say. I long press it. There are two options: ""set available offline"" and ""sync"". I have no idea what the difference is. Don't these words usually mean the same thing? Is one a one-way and one a two-way sync? If so, which one? These options aren't even mentioned in the manual.

Question: What is the difference between these options?

I select ""set available offline"". A yellow emblem appears (an arrow pointing down to a line). Doesn't this sort of emblem usually mean ""downloaded""? Like the green check mark?

Comment: I can see why you might use the green check mark the way you do — on desktop cloud storage apps it usually means ""file is now synced locally"". But on desktop apps there's usually no distinction between a one-off download and files that are kept in two-way sync. In this app, it gets confusing. If I saw the yellow emblem by itself, I'd actually assume that it meant what the green emblem means. I don't even know why you bother with the green one by itself... why does a user need to know what files are in a local cache, if they're not actually being synced?

Personally I'd suggest: green emblem for anything that's kept in sync that's fully downloaded, a blue circling arrow icon for anything that's currently syncing, and nothing at all for locally cached but not-synced files. A local unsynced cache seems like an implementation detail. The real feature I want is synced locally vs. access from cloud on demand, not downloaded once and possibly out of date vs. synced locally.

----

I realise this is an amalgam of a bunch of different issues. I tried to split it up a bit, but I realised I don't know enough about what your intent is with these features, options and emblems to be able to say ""rename X to Y"" or ""this emblem should be this other thing"". Some might be documentation issues, or they might be UX improvements. Feel free to tell me how they could be separated and I'll post them as separate issues."
nextcloud/android,closed,Error when connecting to server,[],"### Actual behaviour
- `Malformed server configuration`
### Expected behaviour
- Successful login
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open Nextcloud app
2. Enter login details
3. Click Connect

### Additional Info/steps

I've been successfully running Owncloud (v8, I think) for a while. I finally have some spare time, so I decided to upgrade to nextcloud. These were the steps I took:

- wiped owncloud server side
- installed nextcloud with the php installer
- created admin user
- created standard user
- Installed apps: mail, contacts, calendar, notes
- Successfully set up nextcloud desktop client
- Removed android dav-droid account
- Attempted to re-add dav-droid account.
  - Discovery failed. I expected this since I remember having to set up .well-known urls for owncloud to work. Looked up that process, found that the nextcloud app can automatically configure dav-droid.
- Uninstalled android owncloud app
- Installed nextcloud on android
- See `steps to reproduce` above.

I'm happy to do another clean reinstall and attempt with a completely clean server config if that would be helpful.

Since version 1.4.0 Nextcloud requires android.permission.

nextcloud/android,closed,Rate limiting from brute force protection prevents login with the Android client,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour
If you enter the wrong password too many times, brute force protection makes it impossible to log in with the Android client because the client seems to time out after 10 seconds while the brute force protection enforces a 30 second delay.

### Expected behaviour
The Android client's timeout should be long enough to handle the delay from brute force protection. Perhaps after waiting 10 seconds the client could display a message saying that login is slow and the current IP address might be blacklisted.
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Enter the wrong password enough times to get your IP address rate limited by brute force protection.
2. Try to log in with the Android client
3. Receive a ""Server took too long to respond"" message after 10 seconds.

I hope I have diagnosed this situation correctly. I changed my password on the server and then tried to connect a few times from the Android client with the old password before remembering that it had changed. After that, I could not log in again even after ensuring the password was correct until I had cleared my ip address from the brute force blacklist as described here: https://help.nextcloud.com/t/how-can-i-unblock-an-ip-blocked-through-brute-force-detection/5731

If you synchronize a folder (or upload files), the fulfillment of the upload/download/synchronization continues even after the internet interface changes.

Practical example: You start synchronizing a 10GB folder while being connected to you WiFi at home. After a while you have to go to work. After leaving the WiFi zone Nextcloud continues synchronizing over LTE (or whatever). After a while you monthly mobile high speed volume is exhausted.

I already described the behavior in #416, but it is a different problem than the one 416's title discusses.

Files which where already in the folder before the other file was marked with ""available offline"" will not be automatically uploaded after modification.

This behavior continues for all additional downloaded and modified files until the android device is rebootet (or the app was restarted - suggestion, not tested). After Reboot, the behavior is as expected.

regardless the result of #416, files created after ""available offline"" setting of a different file should be handled in the same way as files also not marked with ""ao"" before ""ao"" of this one file was changed. This is a bug in my oppinion.
 
### Steps to reproduce

All file create/modification happened on a Linux box with LibreOffice and on an android using AndrOpenOffice.

1. file 1.ods is created on Linux - ownClould client uploads it to the Nextcloud Server - some seconds later it becomes visible in nextcloud App
2. file 1.ods is clicked in ncApp, opened in AndrOpenOffice, modified and safed back to ncAPP directory. No upload is happening to ncServer
3. file 2.ods is created on Linux - ocClient, uploads to ncServer, some seconds later visible in ncApp on Android
4. file 2.ods is modified on Android - no Upload 
5. file 2.ods on ncApp is marked as ""availabe offline"" and get's immediately uploaded to the server (this was part of the discussion in #416)
6. file 3.ods was created on ocClient (Linux), syncs to ncServer, and is visible on ncApp (Android)
7. file 3.ods is modified in Android. It is immediately uploaded to the ncServer without being flagged ""available offline"".
8. you can repeat 6 and 7 for additional files, they behave the same.
9. modify 1.ods and save it - it will not been uploaded to ncServer
10. creating a folder in this directory and repeat 6. and 7. showed, that the problem is not being inherited to the subfolder.

nextcloud/android,closed,Insta Upload stopped working properly,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour
- When connecting wifi, Insta-Upload starts uploading taken photos
- Usually the first 2-3 work fine and then most of the file uploads show some progress (usually until ~70%, but sometimes also less) and then fail
- Retrying of the failed uploads leads to failed uploads again
- also: when entering the InstaUpload directory (in ""All Data""), the nextcloud app failed a lot of times until I was able to enter it (now not happening anymore) -> might have something to do with my insta upload directory containing 4,6gb of files - it's now still slow when I open the directory

### Expected behaviour
-Photos should be uploaded
-If an upload fails, the retry should work
-If a use ""remove failed uploads"", there should be a way how I can synchronize the instant upload directory later. How am I supposed to do this now? I have some pictures that failed to upload and I can't event retry anymore because I accidentally used the remove functionality (now they are still in my phone gallery but not in the instant upload folder in the nextcloud app)
=> It would be nice to have a ""upload all not synchronized/previously failed photos from the gallery"" option or so

nextcloud/android,open,strange behavior on Updating a file,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
I opened a file stored on the server (**not** marked to be offline available in the Details... of the APP). It was a OpenOffice Spreadsheet. The file get's downloaded and is opened with AndrOpenOffice. 

After changing and saving the spreadsheet. The file does **not** get uploaded by nextcloud-APP.
There was no information in the Upload-activity-log.

After that I checked the box **_offline available_**. In the same moment the file get's uploaded to the server.

### Expected behaviour
depends on the design spec:
I assume that a file not to be stored locally (offline available = false) is copied to the tmp folder and opened from there. If this file is updated and the server file is to be updated by specification I expect the file to be immediately updated on the server (or at least within seconds). If an update of the file in the tmp folder will not be updated on the server by design then I would not expect the file to be uploaded after marking the file **_offline available_** 
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Create a spreadsheet file with openoffice on the PC and wait until it is uploaded to the server
2. open the file by tipping it in nextcloudAPP
3. change it and save it 
4. wait some minutes to check whether the file is going to be uploaded (in my case it is not uploaded)
5. now long-tip on the file in nextCloudApp, select ... Menu - Details, check the **_offline available_** checkbox - the modified file immediately get's uploaded to the server

What actually happens: The old downloaded file is shown with no indication it’s outdated. Even makes me think there’s a sync error. You need to manually use »Sync«, then it says there’s a conflict (which is not true) and you need to keep the server version. Or you need to delete the local file which is strange too.

nextcloud/android,open,Feature request: Android Enterprise support,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","I may have touched on enterprise use in the past @AndyScherzinger, but this is slightly different.

Rather than uploading a config payload into an MDM platform alongside the NC app to automatically setup the NC client on a per-user basis, Android Enterprise APIs can be used within the app to provide these configuration fields to administrators as soon as the app is uploaded.

For example, an email client:

![](https://help.nextcloud.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52cc788db1c3e30ecaeb1323b2f7ca6cf45f3f1a.png)

Let's me set the user, server and even password, making deployments to endpoints so easy it's hardly even believable.

If the NC app can hook into the Android Enterprise platform I think you'd have a pretty attractive offering for businesses running 10's of hundreds (/thousands) of android endpoints.

https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations.html

And the beauty is, users can have NC installed for both work and personal, meaning the business controls (and can remove) the data in the NC AE installed app (identified by a small briefcase icon on the app icon) meanwhile the normally installed NC app connects to the user's own NC and can't be tampered with by the business at all.

I can both provide access to my EMM lab environment for testing and/or document the setup and deployment of the app under Android Enterprise."

In order to be able to ""just"" query the USB storage folders a workaround might be that we simply trigger media scans of USB mounts from time to time which will add the media folders to the media database and thus makes them discoverable for us.

nextcloud/android,open,[Enhancement] Delete local files after confirmed sync after period of time,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Desired behaviour
-Setting to sync folder is active
-Files sync to nextcloud for PERIOD OF TIME (say 12 months)
-Toggle for local storage max size or period after which local files are deleted from phone once confirmed synced to server.

First step: Toggle switch to delete synced photos manually that are older than X months. I understand that during sync there is the ability to delete local files on the phone, but I don't want to do that as I prefer to keep them on my phone for a period of time to share and as a second source of backup. It would be great to manually delete synced files older than X months as a starter.

Further enhancement 1: Show how much space can be saved by deleting synced files live as user is toggling smaller time frame.

Further Enhancement 2 (and original goal): Automatically perform above tasks

Use Case 1:
A cellphone has been active since 2012. At the end of each calendar year, User manually deletes the prior year's photos (so delete 2015 backed up photos on Dec 31, 2016) from his phone to give more local space for new 2017 pictures. It would be great to see this automatically delete CONFIRMED SYNCED photos and videos that are over PERIOD OF TIME old. Could be in months with a default 12, min 1 and max 48, with a toggle for on/off?

Use Case 2:
A cellphone has been active since 2012. User phone memory is 8gb stock, and his camera is using up majority of that space and is getting ""low memory"" warning on the phone. User is able to define a max local space for new pictures to use, such that once exceeded the oldest CONFIRMED SYNCED photos or videos are deleted until that maximum space defined is honored again.


Both cases release some of the local resources being taken up by photos that are already on the server and can be downloaded again as required, but a backup for more recent files is kept on the phone. I find that after a calendar year I rarely use photos that are taking storage on my phone. Google has a manual toggle to delete synced photos, I would like to take that one step further."

My question is regarding the UI/UX:
As these uploads are triggered by android the user cannot start them manually.
But it is possible to stop/kill one -> is this necessary?
What else should be displayed:
- Name
- thumbnail
- status: (waiting for wifi connection/waiting for device charging)

nextcloud/android,closed,IllegalStateException,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour
nextCloud Beta crashes in the background or with the app open. The app appears to be updating the files but never stops. This does not occur in the non-beta app.

### Expected behaviour
Files update and the app goes into a passive state.
 
### Steps to reproduce
Not positive of steps but believe this to be it.
1. Share a folder with content with another owncloud user.
2. This folder is synced with a desktop client.
3. Delete the folder from the desktop client without unsharing first.
4. Open the Beta app and go to the directory where the deleted folder is.
5. Wait 3-5 minutes and crash.

When I click on a video that has not been downloaded so far the app starts downloading the video file instead of playing it directly.

### Expected behaviour
When I click on a video that has not been downloaded so far the video should played as video stream, i.e. playing should start immediately and the video should not be downloaded to the internal memory.

There is already a pull request for this feature: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/183

Moreover the feature is already included in the Beta app and works for me (at least when playing the video in an external player).  For some reason the internal player has some issues with several or all video formats.

2. Click on a video."
nextcloud/android,open,[Improvement] Add option to always open video files in external players,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Short description

Please add an option to always open video files in an external player.

### Long description

At the moment, when I click on a video in the Beta app the app starts streaming the video in the internal player.  This is OK for people that don't have any good external video players.  However, there are a lot of people that have very advanced external video players (with brightness control, swipe navigation, etc.), which support much more formats than the internal video player.  For those people it would be nice to open the videos by default in the external player, since the current solution by long pressing the video, going to the context menu, and choosing ""Stream video file in external player"", is really time consuming and unnecessary."

Pro: We get bug reports from stable users but have nearly no chance to gather any information if it is a non-trivial bug that can be reproduced but is rather related to the context (server setup, connection, navigation flow, etc.). So by giving the user the chance to activate logging, send us the log, deactivate logging again we would have better chance to help users and tackle issues

nextcloud/android,open,Make file operations cancellable and/or non-blocking,"[Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Problem: some file operations cannot be cancelled. This is unfortunate if you tap on the wrong one, enter an incorrect file name (rename), find the wrong folder (copy, move), etc.

Items that are currently blocking and (maybe) shouldn't be:

- [ ] Copying
- [ ] Renames
- [ ] Moves
- [ ] Folder creations

Not sure if these should be non-blocking. That'd be the ideal, but only if we can find a way to make the operations cancellable, IMHO.

Items that should stay blocking, but should be cancellable by hitting ""back"" (and _maybe_ by tapping outside of the ""wait a moment"" dialog? Not sure):

_The sorting is weighted and alphabetical, meaning they are sorted alphabetically (while a folder named ""Camera"" wins...) and weighted by active/inactive. Thus active one will be at the top and the Camera folder will always be at the top of the active or the inactive cluster.
The thumbnails shown per folder are always the latest ones (as in date taken, modification-date) and they get cached_

Preferences are adopted from the actual/known instant upload capabilities as is choose the upload folder, wifi only, charging only, created sub-folders, upload behavior, enable/disable.

After looking through the thread [here](https://github.com/owncloud/ios/issues/701), where users faced a similar issue there seemed to be an issue with email fields in LDAP. However, I have not enabled LDAP on my installation.

> android app crashes when trying to sort a directory of photos to upload

@tobiasKaminsky please review - This is a work in progress since imho the implementation is broken for a simply reason. OCFIleList and LocalFileList both use the same preference for the sorting choice. So if you choose BySize in the main screen and then open upload via the FAB it'll load ""by Size"" and will try to sort this way. Unfortunately the local file sorting by size also sorts folders, by recursively calculating their size which takes around one minute on my phone... So imho we either need to 
- remove folders from the local file sorting as in sort by size with folders on top sorted alphabetically or
- split the sorting choice into two preferences and don't offer sorting by size at all.

What do you think @tobiasKaminsky - I vote for ignore folders during size sorting (locally)

nextcloud/android,closed,Uploader: don’t make the account choice a blocking popup ,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""good first issue""), Label(name=""hacktoberfest""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","I have 2 accounts configured in my Nextcloud mobile app. There is a blocking account chooser popup every time I want to upload something.

This isn’t great beacuse most of the time I use my personal instead of my company account anyway. So:
- we should directly show the file list, defaulting to the account last used
- put a switcher dropdown in the top bar

Ok @tobiasKaminsky @AndyScherzinger? (As already discussed in the old repo ;)
"
nextcloud/android,open,Files appear as conflicting with the server even though they were not modified on server,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","Hello,

I have posted this as an ownclient client issue but migrated to nextcloud since, and I also have the issue.  I am not sure whether cross-posting it a good idea, and I am sorry if it is not.
### Actual behaviour

When a file is modified twice on the client within a few seconds and the first upload to the server didn't finish, I get a popup telling me the local version is in conflict with the distant version.
Expected behaviour

A file should not be in conflict with the server version if the file hasn't been modified on the server…
### Steps to reproduce
1. Make a file available offline
2. Make a few quick changes and saves to that file, making sure that your saves happen before the previous version was uploaded to the server (I personally always trigger the error with a todo.txt file modified via an app called Simpletask)
3. The ""conflict resolution"" popup opens within nextcloud client.

This issue is about discussing if (and how) we can allow to change the sorting order.

Ideas:
- Add 3 options with reversed order: Z -> A 
  - ugly as hell -> NO
- Second click on same order reverts sorting order
  - not understandable/visible for user
- use fast scroll instead of reversing order
  - user can easily and fast scroll down

The DocumentsProvider should be shown, and you should be able to select Nextcloud directories.
### Android Dev Reference:

If you're implementing a DocumentsProvider and want to support subtree selection, implement isChildDocument() and include FLAG_SUPPORTS_IS_CHILD in your COLUMN_FLAGS.

I could maybe implement that, but it would need a lot of time (which I don't have until around christmas probably), since I know nearly nothing about the Storage Access Framework and how it works, and completely nothing about the internals of the Nextcloud App, so someone else would probably be able to do this faster (and better).

nextcloud/android,closed,Data on sd-card only readable for other android apps under android 6.0x,[],"### Actual behaviour

If you use the storagepath on sd, other apps, p.e. keepass2Android or Gallery can only access to the files readonly. Only Nextcloud itself can write to its directories.

Path to sd is /storage/9016-XXXX/Android/data/com.nextcloud.android.beta/files
Path to memory is /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.nextcloud.android.beta/files

I think this issue is by security design of android 6.0x, but makes the storing to sd-card nearly useless, because, you can't change or delete files using other apps.
### Expected behaviour

Also other apps should be able to change or delete files in the Nextcloud sd-directory

### Actual behaviour

-During an upload of selected files, some files fail to upload without an obvious reason. The behaviour is intermittent. The weird thing is, it doesn't matter if I start the upload in any of the following ways:
1) open 'photos' app and use 'share' functionality to upload it to my nextcloud server
2) open the nextcloud app and use its upload functionality to select files from the 'photos' app
3) via the web interface using Chrome Web Browser on my Nexus - it also fails (for instance, after one picture has been uploaded, it just stop uploading the next ones, without any error)

for steps 1) and 2), if I try to re-upload the failing photos, they will fail again.

This problem seems to be unique to my Nexus 5X device. I have a Samsung tablet and a Samsung mobile phone and they upload all files successfully all the time.
My issue looks somehow similar to #287 , however my logs seem to be a bit different.
### Expected behaviour
- All selected files should be upload successfully to the selected forlder.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Select number of photos to upload, either via the 'photos' app or the nextcloud app itself

#### Nextcloud log (data/nextcloud.log)

nothing there :(

I've posted logcat output from my Nexus here:
http://pastebin.com/k9LsafcJ

In this case, out of the 11 files I've tried to upload only 7 (I think) ended up successfully uploaded to the server.
"
nextcloud/android,closed,Upload from Android app fails,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour

-(Auto)upload from Android app fails ALMOST always after a variable progress
### Expected behaviour

-(Auto)upload from Android app should succeed :)
### Steps to reproduce
1. Configure App to upload new photos (here: in Wifi, without charging)
2. Take photo
3. See upload progress to a variable level, then fail with ""connection error"" (""Verbindungsfehler"")
### Further info

Uploading AND autouploading of certain files fails. The failing seems pretty reproducible for some file, especially most (but not all) camera images. Some other file can be uploaded without problems (including a 400+MB video). Some other videos also fail. I cannot find any pattern. Behavior is observed in 2 generally stable wifis.
I should perhaps note: The file for the logs belowis 4197043 bytes large. The error says it expected 353728 got 101043.
If the last chunk has 101043, this would leave 1024000 bytes for each of the other chunks, with is a number that makes a lot of sense. Why did it expect 353728 bytes?
I am pretty sure this is a very strong pointer to the root of the problem.

nextcloud/android,closed,Instant camera upload stopped after installing sd card,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","## What happens

Been using instant upload to sync camera pictures for about a month, no problem. Installed an sd card (which camera uses as default storage location now) and now every picture says ”local file not found” when attempting to upload.
## What should happen

The files should upload as they did before the sd card was installed.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Configure instant upload, take picture, works fine
2. Install sd card & set camera to use it as storage
3. Take picture & app reports local file not found

I think we should improve in this area, either via displaying a more detailed message or via activating the logging on stable clients (see #247) to give people the change to gain some more information. In general though I think more detailed error message might confuse since non-tech users might get confused but for error reporting and knowing what is going on it might be critical information.
With failed downloads might might anyways have to implement some auto-restart, e.g. on the next wifi connect or else so users wouldn't even have to look into the uploads view and investigate...

what do you think @tobiasKaminsky and also @nextcloud/designers also from the UX/UI perspective since infos might get very technical

See screenshot above, the ""folder chooser"" for move file and copy file which is launched after single/multi selection of a file from the main file list view always says ""Nextcloud"" so you don't have a detailed context. So my proposal is to show ""Copy to..."" and ""Move to..."" as the title to set the context right. Else the user has to remember the action that has been chosen before.

As for testing we need to make sure that all (other) chooser screens like when sharing with Nextcloud isn't affected by this.

nextcloud/android,open,Autoupload fails due to reset of the trusted certificate,"[Label(name=""AutoUpload""), Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""medium"")]","### Actual behaviour
- Autoupload fails instantly on every photo to upload and every retry 
- No specific error code or error description
- No logs on Nextcloud server
### Expected behaviour
- Working autoupload feature
### Steps to reproduce
1. Take a picture
2. Wait for autoupload
3. See how it fails
### Workaround
1. Enter the Nextcloud app

- there should be no notification about a failed upload

@jancborchardt Does that make sense? I'm always annoyed by this behavior because I think that something is broken even if this isn't the case.

Beside that for real failures they should maybe not say: ""failed upload due to connection issues"" but something like ""3 queued upload - they are retried once the network connection is better"" because sometimes you have flaky internet connection but you don't care about the upload, but it should actually do it at some time and not not at all after the first failed try.

However, in the title bar of the app there is **always**  the name Nextcloud visible, despite the fact, that I changed the Name of each server instance by the theming app. 
To be able to distinguish between different server instances more visible, it would be highly appreciated, if the **TITLE bar** in the app would reflect the **NAME of server instance**, given in the theming app!
That means, changing the server instance with its own Name, causes the Name of the instance to be displayed in the **TITLE Bar** of the app as long, as i am connected to this server!

I hope, I got it right and clearly explained!

nextcloud/android,open,Security Risk: auto downloading file to device and Google's built in file explorer or any file explorer,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour

My Nextcloud application is setup to require a password on start before accessing any data, but when I click on a file, the application is caching the file to the device permanently despite not checking ""make this file available offline"" in the settings menu. The cached data can then be accessed without a password through Google's integrated file browser found in Settings>Storage>Explore. Android will not allow viewing of the file because it's not within the Nextcloud app, but I can email or text the file to anyone and it can be opened like any other file.
### Desired behaviour

The Nextcloud application should have a global setting, ""Cache data locally"", with each file having their own setting, ""make available offline"".
1. If the global setting is disabled, any data downloaded via the Nextcloud application should be stored in RAM ONLY and purged once the application is closed. This global setting, if enabled, would also permanently disallow individual file, ""make available offline"".
2. If the global setting is enabled, any data downloaded via the Nextcloud application should be stored locally on the device, as it is now, but purged once the application is closed unless the user sets ""make available offline"" and then ONLY those files are retained on the device.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open Nextcloud
2. Set password required
3. Click on a file: document, picture, video, whatever
4. Open Settings>Storage>Explore

Selecting a folder, however, makes a refresh/sync icon appear on the top right. _(UX remark: I expected to see a ""Set available offline"" menu entry pop up for the folder as well. It took me a minute of going back and forth between folders and files to realize that there's that icon, instead, and that it doesn't just refresh the current view.)_ As a user, I have absolutely no clue what tapping this icon does. Does it do a one-time download? Does it make the folder permanently available offline (i.e. one-way sync)? A two-way sync? (I know the latter hasn't been implemented yet but still.)

To me it looks like it makes all files contained in the folder available offline one-by-one as I suddenly see green check marks appearing on all my files in that folder (similarly to if I had made them available offline individually). However, I do not see a similar check mark on the folder itself. Does that mean it is a one-time procedure only and new files in the folder won't automatically be made available offline later? Lots of questions here…

**Update:** I just realized that offline availability is now denoted by a yellow download icon, while a green check mark means… that the file is in fact available on the device, i.e. was downloaded, and/or that it is up-to-date? Quite confusing! Anyway, I therefore assume that the sync/refresh icon appearing for folders just downloads all files in the folder once?

**My suggestion:** Make the terminology and the use of icons consistent and their meaning unambiguous. If in doubt, introduce a menu entry ""Legend help"" to explain the icons.

PS: I hope it doesn't make a difference but I'm still running OwnCloud. According the [announcement of the Android client](https://nextcloud.com/nextcloud-android-client-1-1-0-is-here/), the latter should still be fully compatible to OwnCloud.

Open issue:
- quota string formatting. For now I went with `%1$s of %2$s used` which could re-use the given formatter for (might need some work or a slightly different string) so %1$s and %2$s would be the sizes with the units calculated like the one in the file lists e.g. ""1MB of 3,0GB used"", another idea (like dropbox) would be to mix: ""10% of 3,0GB used"" - both have their advantages and disadvantages.

DONE
- coloring of the progress bar: ""just blue"" or turning yellow-ish and red-ish when hitting certain thresholds like 85% and 95%? And if so which yellow/red colors should be used.

As a sidenote, for now I had to add a ""invisible"" menu item for the bottom padding since I cannot customize the layouting of the menu-list itself which is imho okay until AppCompat provides more options to customize the drawer itself.

### Steps to reproduce
1.  Open the Uploads view in the drawer
### Backround

This bug has been reported several times on the Play developer console.
This bug is present in oC and Nc. 
Research shows it is likely related to a wrongly implemented comparator and Android's swicth to JDK 7 which leads to Array.sort using a different algorithm: https://dertompson.com/2012/11/23/sort-algorithm-changes-in-java-7/

If this general behavior is approved I would start working on an implementation on the main list which shows the files on server/on device as a first implementation. If that is done we can then think about adopting this also on other screens like file picker for upload I probably wouldn't implemented it on all screens but may on all list or just most lists...not sure though.

any feedback/comments? @tobiasKaminsky @jancborchardt @przybylski ?

You can see this behavior in Chrome on Android for example.

Both accounts should be synchronized.

I know I currently run owncloud, but I think there are not many differences ATM between oC and nC. Insyamd picture upload for example works. Syncing also works when I open the app. Only background syncing for the main account does bit work as expected.

Good idea. 
Should we, for now, mention the one and only thing (file drop) that is not compatible?

nextcloud/android,closed,Unreliable / disfunctional (auto) sync with PIN code lock,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behavior
- File is not automatically updated if PIN/Code Lock is enabled

- You you setup Nextcloud/ownCloud without a PIN, all favorite files are downloaded when they change on Server
- File should update ... anyway... Enabling PIN / Code may not decline this function. Even if you say ""it's about security"": it is not, an old once synced file is still in the filesystem unless you have enabled PIN / Code or not

1. setup app 
2. mark a file as favorite
3. change this file externally
4. see this file is being updated on phone automatically
5. setup PIN/Code Lock in Nextcloud app

nextcloud/android,closed,Per Directory Sort Instead of Globally,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","### Approved idea

Store sort order folder based, with descending the order to subfolder.
(like list vs. grid view is doing it)
### Expected behaviour

If I change the sort option in one directory, it is remebered for that directory.  When I leave, the sort goes back to the default A-Z sort method.

Nextcloud server version: Nextcloud 9.0.52 (stable)

Owncloud's sync app has the opposite behavior as nextCloud's.   With owncloud, when you set _Folder A_ to **Newest - Oldest** sorting, upon leaving said folder the sorting reverts to **A-Z** sorting.  When I reenter _Folder A_, it remembers my previous sorting method and displays accordingly.

This is probably an individual preference for each user but I am interested to see if other people feel similarily.  Maybe it should be an option in settings? Thanks for all of your work!

nextcloud/android,closed,"Support for ""files drop"" feature","[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","Nextcloud allows you to create public link shares where the users don't see the file listing but can only upload files. This is how it looks like in the web interface:

If a public link is created and the ""Allow editing"" permission was set a additional check box shows up, ""Hide file listing"". If activated it removes the ""read"" permissions, so it is a simple permissions change which can already be done by the OCS API. Of course this option only exists for folders.

I could reproduce the crash, here is the log:

nextcloud/android,closed,Grid view > back while folder is loading crashes app,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","### Actual behaviour

If ""Show grid view"" and then the back arrow in the top left corner are clicked, while a folders contents are still loading, the nextcloud app crashes.
### Expected behaviour

The app should just go back to the previous folder without crashing.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open a folder with many files (I used my instant upload folder, and tested with others)
2. While it's loading, click the three dot menu in the top right
3. Click ""Grid view"" (going the opposite direction and choosing ""List view"" won't crash the app)
4. Click the left/back arrow in the top, left corner of the app

nextcloud/android,closed,No instant update of folder list when changing active account (Nextcloud beta Android-App 20160621),"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""dev version""), Label(name=""needs info/discussion"")]","### Actual behaviour

No ""instant"" update of the files list after choosing a different account from the dropdown. 

One have to wait until the screen gets locked. After unlocking the screen the files list is getting updated (caused by an event ?). Manually updating the account (via '...' menu) works well. In no case there's any visual feedback (except the changing files list) which might be suboptimal.
### Expected behaviour

Choosing a different account should lead to an instant update of the files list so one can see the directory structure of the recently choosen account 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Have two different accounts ready to use with different files/directories

nextcloud/android,open,Refactor: Create a ThumbImageView,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Thumbnails of images are currently shown in 3 different places. The uploadlist, the local file browser and the normal folder view of an nextcloud folder.

The code to generate a thumbnail / kickof the thumbnail generation is present in all of there places.

To unify this, i would like to propose a ThumbImageView class which subclases ImageView. This Class should handle all concern regarding File or OCFile -> Thumbnail, by calling ThumbManager and so on.

The ImageView objects are reused in the list views, all code accesing these Views has to check whether the reference they use, still refer to a View with the initial File, this could be solved by having a Reference to OCFile or File on the ThumbImageView aswell as the unique thumbnail CacheKey!

So we have some new methods like
void setFile(File file);
void setOCFile(OCFile file);
int getCacheKey(); (maybe override .hashCode(), but this could be problematic with OCFiles not existing)

Another possibility would be to introduce two additional classes
FileThumbImageView and OCFileThumbImageView.. As far as i understand it, the Upload Queue and local filebrowser lists use File and the nextcloud folder browser uses OCFile..

This should only a refactor not any addition of new functionality.

"
nextcloud/android,closed,Resized images,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","What it does, copied from ownCloud and heavily discussed there, so here just a CR:
- Clicking on an image loads a reduced version to the cache.
- The width and height is determinated by the screen.
- the benefit is a very small, but yet usable preview of the image.
- it can be used to send via whatsapp, or as a file to another app (like k9) with the correct filename.
- resized images are not treated as downloaded files. If the user wants to have the real file, he has to long-click and select download.
- clicking on an image shows first a square thumbnail (if available) until the resized image is loaded

**ToDo**
- [x] test with disabled API (gallery app)
  - test if thumbnails api can be used -> not possible right now
- [x] Unsupported image formats https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/1599#issuecomment-229400874
  - [x] svg
  - [x] tiff
- [x] Bad preview of landscape images https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/1599#issuecomment-229406324 [WIP]
- [x] sharing a non-downloaded image on Android N fails (at least with whatsapp)
- [ ] sharing a non-cached resized image fails -> first download resized version
- [ ] a resized image should load immediately (first on queue or dismiss all other current downloads)
- [x] ~~download of a resized image also with a nice download animation on the bottom?~~
- [x] snackbar is sometimes beneath virtual keys
- [ ] ~~if resized version show ""sending resized image"" otherwise ""send"" (as it is  now)~~
- [x] test with disabled data
  - [x] show resized image if available
  - [x] show thumbnail if resized image not available
  - [x] show (something smart) if both is not available -> default image icon
- [x] on air plane mode: snackbar is shown all the time as resized download files -> prior check of connection

Assumptions:
- users do not want to download the whole image, instead just like streaming have only a resized version
- if an user wants to have many images in original quality, he can synchronize the folder

This leads us to
- always show a resized version
- if an user zooms in (> 2x) a snackbar ""download full image: yes"" will be shown (on every time)
- (to have the old behaviour: add setting ""click on image downloads full image"" (as checkbox))

nextcloud/android,open,Feature Request: Prevent duplicate uploads,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","## Wanted behaviour

When I attempt to upload a duplicate file, I'd like it to prompt me before it uploads. Maybe a message that states ""x with that name and datestamp already exists. Upload another copy?""

In an ideal world it would be able to do this with several files in one go, rather than 1 by 1 so as to agree or disagree with duplicate uploads all at once, but anything would be acceptable at the moment.
## Actual behaviour

Currently uploading duplicates just appends a number in brackets, meaning I then later have to manually remove duplicates.

fixed a bug, which retriggered thumbnail loading, after a thumbnail was loaded and the view was scrolled at the end of the view (beginning and and aswell as backscroll).

All I/O is now done in a AsyncTask, even cache I/O on the flash, as it really introduced stutter, because flash read access aswell as JPEG->Bitmap Decoding is done on the UI Thread.

I added a bitmap in memory cache for thumbnails (LRUCache), this cache is queried in the AsyncTask aswell (should not be).

I think final solution would be

Check Memory Bitmap Cache
  Hit -> Use the bitmap directly on UI Thread
  Miss -> Start AsyncTask and query JPEG DiskCache
     Hit -> Decode and set the save bitmap in memcache aswell as set it on the UI Thread
     Miss -> generate the thumbnail, save in both caches and update bitmap in UI Thread

Otherwise scrolling large folders with a lot of Thumbs is a pain / looks stuttery.

After the Android app got autoupdated on my phone the server view just tries to refresh but won't update.

Tried removing the profile in the app and add it back. When NC app tries to conenct to the server the app responds with ""Unknown error occurred!"" Tested both on WiFi on the same LAN as the server, and via 4G.
### Expected behaviour

Android app 1.0.1 should manage to reload content from server version 9.0.50.

1. Remove server profile in app

nextcloud/android,closed,Modern Toolbar / Drawer / Account Switcher,[],"Use the new toolbar and support lib drawer implementation - Google's new, to be used implementation of the top bar instead of the action bar which can be considered legacy. Besides that the new implementation also sports an account switcher and avatars (images and default generated server-alike color circles).

**Motivation**
The actionbar is simply a bar which can have a menu, search widget and in newer AppCompat versions also a drawer implementation but isn't as flexible as the toolbar.

**Reasons and benefits**
The toolbar can be customized on many ways like but not limited to:
- adding any kind of views to it, like the progressbar which would be nice especially when 
  - we integrate the multi select branch (no dark blue line below the then grey bar)
  - no dark blue line below the bar when the drawer is opened
- animate it, like scrolling it away on a list/recycler view which seems nice on the file browsing views
- the material drawer can be full height, like mentioned in #1210 because this is only possible for the toolbar not the action bar (it can be done with hacks though)

"
nextcloud/android,closed,Move vs Copy are both disruptive - can it work like other apps?,"[Label(name=""approved""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""pr exists"")]","### Actual behaviour

When uploading, the options provided are to either move the file from it's location to the NC directory or make a copy of it. 

For the former and especially in the case of photos traditionally kept in DCIM this leads to fragmentation of files in other places on the filesystem (and therefore harder to manage)

For the latter, copying doubles storage usage per file, with many photos taken the disk usage can get into the gigabytes before the day is over.
### Expected behaviour

Like other apps, uploading shouldn't disrupt the location of files nor duplicate everything on storage. 
Perhaps investigating and replicating the functionality of dropbox, onedrive or Google photos would be a good place to start. 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Tap to upload 
2. Choose whether to move or copy
3. Instantly regret either decision

nextcloud/android,closed,Add contacts and calendar support to mobile,[],"The problem: I need three diffrent apps to sync all my data

owncloud, CalDav Sync Adapter and DAVDroid.

DAVdroid has the problem is you need two accounts, one for calendar, the other for contacts. It also chokes on my calendar.(a little large). It also needs a long not-obvious string that is mentioned nowhere in documentation except third party sites.

So, I would like calender and contact support in the official app, so one account will sync everything. Also makes it somewhat easier for novices.(non-technical friends/customers/employees), who merely use someone elses owncloud install.

"
nextcloud/android,open,Allow arbitrary folders to be synchronized,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Currently the nextCloud app will create a one to one folder representation of the remote server when synchronizing a directory. However it would be really helpful on a mobile device to map a device directory to a remote server directory.

A use case would be syncronizing a workspace directory of an app on the mobile device with a dedicated directory path on the remote server. For instance a directory with pictures often edited by a mobile app synchronized with a subpath of 'Photos' on the remote server. Or you want to synchronize a shared folder with music into you music library directory on you mobile device...

This would assume issue #19 to be working, such that changes on the mobile device are propagated to the remote server.

How the nextCloud app should behave:

- changes to files (create, update, delete) of a synchronized folder should be propagated back to the server
- conflicting changes should open a dialog (overwrite on device/server, rename)

- In Google Play, the first screenshot of Nextcloud client shows a user 'hans' with a password of only two characters, as represented by '••'.
