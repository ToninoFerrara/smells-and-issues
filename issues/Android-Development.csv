Would really help the community get a better understanding of the way CityZen is structured as a project.
- is our community highly prioritizing producing secure software?
- Do we have what is considered a well-documented channel to report security issues, along with a documented response process?
- do we prioritize backward compatibility, documentation of any incompatible changes, tools and documentation to help users transition to new release features?
- Is our project striving for timely response to bug reports?
- does our project include unit and integration test suites of sufficient coverage? Is coverage documented?
- Do we include enough documentation for anyone to test or deploy any of the software?
- Do we include documentation for a software developer of moderate skill to set up their development environment to contribute?
- we document how we integrate with OpenStreetMap and other projects (Mapbox in the future?)
- is a Continuous Integration pipeline is used for testing and deployment purposes?"

- Do releases consist of source code, distributed using standard and open archive formats that are expected to stay readable in the long term?
- Are the releases signed and/or distributed with hashes/digest\ that can be reliably used to validate downloaded archives?
- Are convenience binaries distributed alongside source code, but they are not official releases (a convenience provided with no guarantee)?
- is the release process publicly documented and repeatable so someone new to the project is able to independently generate the complete set of artifacts required for a release?
- Are release plans developed and executed in public by the community, and approved by the project's governing body? 
- Is CityZen project using a standard release taxonomy (e.g., alpha, beta, semantic versioning).
- Is the version that is available online now on F-Droid considered a stable version.

Look at the screenshots here under,

- the second one only display the name as the address, which does not make any sense.

Also in Belgium (and lots of other countries), we need the house number of the place ; the street is not enough to find (easily) the place.

CityZenApp/Android-Development,open,Bus stop showing bus routes,"[Label(name=""feature proposal""), Label(name=""low priority"")]","Transportation is always a subexplored area. Some ideas:

1. On selecting a bus stop, CityZen could show a list of bus routes that attend it.
2. Pay atention to the public_transport:version=2. Most of the existing based aplications don't support the new version. I mean, they don't recoginize route_master and stop_area. E.g., many times the name is on the stop_area only and not on platform/stop_position. Tags from/to are important too. Relation rules entry/exit(_only) the same way...

I saw from the code that the radius was 600m. From the screenshot I am showing where a hotel is( green color) and where I'm (red color) also because the routing is not functioning right now. 
Category hotel/hostel only shows me one hotel which is twice as far as this one. I see the problem from filtering results, because on the code it only searches for a single point, while this hotel (and other properties also) is not mapped as a single point but as an area which means there is more than a pair of coordinates (longitude,latitude).

**Warning :**
The format of opening hours is **wrong** ! Should be `hh:mm-hh:mm` (with a dash) instead of `hh:mm:hh:mm` !
