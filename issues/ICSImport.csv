danielegobbetti/ICSImport,open,Won't import .ics file correctly,[],"I'm trying to import one of schulferien.org's .ics file:
http://www.schulferien.org/media/ical/deutschland/ferien_nordrhein-westfalen_2017.ics

I expect the whole .ics file to be adopted either as a local calendar or as a subscription.
Opening the downloaded file results in a new event dialog for the christmas holidays only, starting today (Jan 3rd), to be added to an existing calendar...
The whole concept is wrong here, so please tell me how to help."

When getting any MS Outlook Invitation received by K9-Mail, ICSImport says invalid ICS file.

FYI same meeting processed by ICS-Importer seems to work, didn't perform the last step. But event was shown correctly, and all calendars are shown, esp. my calDAV OwnCloid ones.

Could I be of any below for you, testing/debugging?

Just drop me a note,
