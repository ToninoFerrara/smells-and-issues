amiga/sonorox,open,crash when leaving sonorox through home button,[],"Hello,

When I leave sonorox through the home button or by opening another app, it crashes when I try to go back to it. It does not matter if you go through the last used apps menu or involving it again from the launcher.

I get the message ""sonorox has crashed"".

I can leave and return to the program when I use the back button.

Regards

amiga/sonorox,open,change volume,[],"Hello,

I cannot change the volume of the phone with the hardware buttons, when sonorox is running.

I am using a nexus 4 with cm installed. Downloaded sonorox from the f-droid app repo. I am using sonorox version 1.0.1.
