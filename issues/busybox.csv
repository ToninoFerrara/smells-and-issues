meefik/busybox,open,Feature Request: A/B device support,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi there,

busybox install fails on my device, since it has no /system partition. For me it must remont /.

> zangyapro:/ # mount
> /dev/root on / type ext4 (ro,seclabel,relatime,data=ordered)
/system are only a directory on /.

Please add the right mount option. Maybe a zip file is here the better option, because the binaries should be copied to both / partitions. addon.V2 will be the right way I think."

I'm on lineage os 15.1 on a Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 device. I would like to set the hardware clock using the hwclock command. However, issuing hwclock -w as root produces this error:

meefik/busybox,open,xargs falsely exits 0 on errors in 1.28.4 (worked correctly in 1.27.2),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Upgrading busybox from 1.27.2 -> 1.28.4 completely broke how xargs handles error codes.

Before:

- loop through script executions via piped input

- xargs stops execution, returns error code to shell

After:

- loop through script executions via piped input
- on script failure, `exit 255`
- xargs stops execution and **returns 0**
  - our builds that rely on xargs to iterate over automated test suites are now ""passing"" and deploying broken code"
meefik/busybox,open,[Feature Request] Add support to uninstall BusyBox via flash,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","You have the ""Zip archive"" option to be able to install BusyBox via recovery, as well as the two ""Install"" and ""Remove"" buttons for installation and removal using the app interface. What about a ""Remove BusyBox"" .zip archive for flashing?

In simpler terms: the app supports two ways of installation (UI & recovery), but only one way of removal (UI). My request is support for removal via recovery.

Hopefully that made sense lol"
meefik/busybox,open,[Feature request] Automatic updates,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I'm lazy and don't want to have to manually click ""install"" to update the Busybox binaries when the app has been updated. How about implementing some sort of check that upgrades the binaries in /system automatically when the app has been upgraded and an older version of the binaries is installed?

Thanks for your great app by the way. The addon.d support is good for people like me who use LineageOS and don't like to have to manually click ""install"" all the time."

I just installed your busybox version to use oandbackup.
When i make the install, an error occured when copying ssl_helper.

Does this can make busybox not running well for oandbackup ?
Because i have bad attachment errors in oandbackup and they said it seems to be a busubox problem. What do you think ?

(Sorry if this should have been sent to the original BusyBox author, I just don't know how to contact him...)

The 'touch' command in BusyBox seems not able to handle full precision timestamps (with micro/nano seconds). For example, `touch -d ""2015-01-01 01:01:01.123456789"" File` currently returns ""touch: invalid date '...'"". Also, the `-r` parameter does copy timestamps up to seconds precision (`2015-01-01 01:01:01.000000000`).

If anything can be done, many thanks."

meefik/busybox,open,Is Tar Ignoring -X and --exclude?,[],I am running your busybox due to the use of LinuxDeploy. Before that I was using Stericson's. I have a nightly backup of the internal SD card on my device and I use both -X and --exclude to avoid issues of trying to tar files that are in use or otherwise not wanted in the backup. I log the output for the tar command to a file and I see files that should be excluded in the output. On other devices using Stericson's I do not see this. Is there something wrong that I am doing? Or do these options simply not work even though they are showing if I simply execute tar? Thanks!

meefik/busybox,open,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.app.Activity: void onRequestPermissionsResult(int,java.lang.String[],int[])>:[23,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

NONE

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the project’s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report.

meefik/busybox,open,Systemless install support,[],"Starting with Android M, many root-dependant application insert their files into filesystem by loading them from image, which is picked up by patched boot. This way, it's both easier to wipe root in case it's not needed, and allows for OTA updates, which now check if /system has been remounted even once, and just dump the whole system image instead of per-file upgrade. This means that if one is to tamper with /system, he had to reflash the whole ROM to enable the OTA again. This can be avoided by baking the whole BusyBox and symlinks inside image, and deploying it via Magisk, for example. For reference, both SuperSU (Android 6+, custom systemless scenario) and Xposed (Magisk version) use this, and that's not counting things like SafetyNet bypass, ad blocker, VIPER4Android, and whatever new fad people come up with.

meefik/busybox,open,UX: Make settings easier to access,[],"Something as important as the installation settings shouldn't be behind a menu overflow, among unimportant settings, when there's so much unused space. I recommend moving the BusyBox section of the settings screen to the main screen, or at least putting a settings button on the action bar.

This proposal may seem petty, but I'm proposing this because I found it confusing how linuxdeploy didn't work despite installing the meefik BusyBox. Since the main screen was so minimalistic, with only the buttons of Install and Remove, I thought there's nothing else to customize about the installation. I think making the settings easier to access would make things more intuitive.

Also, the button leading to the installation settings was easy to find in linuxdeploy, in plain sight on the main screen, so I expected them to be just as easy to find in this app as well.
