I am trying to build the project Android-USB-Serial-Monitor-Lite by using the source code from here https://github.com/ksksue/Android-USB-Serial-Monitor-Lite.

Added the physicoloid library as mentioned here https://github.com/ksksue/PhysicaloidLibrary

But,I am getting Warnings(9) as Dead code as shown in the attached image.Every Warnign is related to the BuildConfig.DEBUG.

Can someone help me fixing this Dead Code warning.

ksksue/Android-USB-Serial-Monitor-Lite,closed,Actually not an issue,[],"Hi!

I tryied to communicate with bus pirate from mk808 android device, but couldn't communicate to ""bus pirate"".

I used following code:
        // Get UsbManager from Android.
        UsbManager manager = (UsbManager) getSystemService(Context.USB_SERVICE);

```
    // Find the first available driver.
    UsbSerialDriver driver = UsbSerialProber.acquire(manager);

    if (driver != null) {
        try {
            driver.open();
            driver.setParameters(115200, UsbSerialDriver.DATABITS_8, UsbSerialDriver.STOPBITS_1,  UsbSerialDriver.PARITY_NONE);
            byte buffer[] = new byte[16];
            driver.write((""m"" + ""\r"").getBytes(), 1000);
            int numBytesRead = driver.read(buffer, 1000);
            Log.d(this.getClass().getSimpleName(), ""Read "" + numBytesRead + "" bytes: "" + new String(buffer).toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.d(this.getClass().getSimpleName(), e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                driver.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // TODO Auto-generated catch block
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
```

From log I get strange characters back ( I am expecting to get something like bus pirate returns) - see below:
02-25 02:34:37.828: D/MainActivity(4888): device: /dev/bus/usb/001/007 Product id:24577 vendor id:1027

02-25 02:34:52.048: D/MainActivity(4888): Read 3 bytes: `??????????????????????????????

Actually I read something from bus pirate but it's not what I expected. I see from code of
AndroidUSBSerialMonitorLite.java
That you initialized the usb for ftdi FT232RL somehow different.
Is there some simple code (like I tried it above) to send something to bus pirate?

Thank you very much for any suggestion or code maybe.
