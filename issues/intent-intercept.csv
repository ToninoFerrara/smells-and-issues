intrications/intent-intercept,closed,"Doesn't intercept firefox ""open externally"" intents",[],"Sorry for the non-technical writing, I'm on my phone and don't want to try to slog through the mozilla codebase from it. I don't think I even have enough storage space. But if you open a direct link to an image, an android logo appears in the URL bar (at least in Aurora), letting you open the image in an external app. However, the photo viewer I want to use is not listed, and since this doesn't catch it I can't figure out which intent it's using.

I can try to gather details later, but I thought I'd report the bug.

intrications/intent-intercept,open,Doesn't catch some android.intent.action.VIEW when mime type is NULL ?,[],"""termux-notification -u""  generates this intents with a NULL mimetype (https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/35)

Intent Intercept catches the intent when it has scheme ""http:"" but not when it has scheme ""file:""

This one works:
  termux-notification -c xxxx -u http://www.google.com
this not:
  termux-notification -c xxxx -u file:///sdcard/xxx.html

Example caught:
## intent://www.google.com#Intent;scheme=http;launchFlags=0x13000000;end

ACTION: android.intent.action.VIEW
DATA: http://www.google.com
URI: intent://www.google.com#Intent;scheme=http;launchFlags=0x13000000;end
FLAGS:
FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT
FLAG_ACTIVITY_PREVIOUS_IS_TOP
FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND

Providing the example for the not caught one is not so easy, GhostCommander catches the view intent and opens a directory.

intrications/intent-intercept,closed,Refactored string resources introduced in #29: ,[],"... to make it much easier for translators to add a new language. Only 38 items have to be translated instead of 75 before
- renamed string-ids to become more contextsesitive so translaters know more about their meaning
  - Example: strings for the settings activity are prefixed with ""settings_""
- renamed some resource-ids  
  - Example: R.id.data becomes R.id.data_edit
  - Example: R.id.activities_layout becomes R.id.intent_matchin_activities_layout
- moved non translatable strings.xml to donottranslate.xml
  - text_plain in strings.xml becomes mime_type_text_plain in donottranslate.xml  
- removed fromatting from string resources to code making translating much easier for translators 
  - the new intent_extras_title replaces the old extras, extra, extra_count, extras_title_bold, bundle_title_bold, bundle_title_bold_uppercase
- moved some string resources back to code. 
  - for example preference-id: @string/intercept_enable_pref
- added those german translations that are not Intend-api specific
- reimplemented parts of getIntentDetailsStrings
