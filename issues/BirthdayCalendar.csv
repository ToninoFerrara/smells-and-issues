saschpe/BirthdayCalendar,open,Missing Birthday Adapter's reminder flexibility in Birthday Calendar's settings,[],"Hi Sascha,

I liked (maybe loved?) and used _Birthday Adapter_ - the app _Birthday Calendar_ is based on - (and I'm still using it up to now), and for sure it's really great that you brought the concept to the next level by creating _Birthday Calendar_.

But why to hell you shriveled up _Birthday Adapter's_ fantastic reminder concept with its three reminders that were able to be set to any daytime to only to simple reminders??
Please, bring (back?) _Birthday Adapter's_ glorious reminders to _Birthday Calendar_ - I'm really being you!
<br>
<br>
_(**Rem.:** Nix f√ºr ungut, aber ich finde die Konfigurierbarkeit der Reminder echt eine der praktischsten Funktionen beim Birthday Adapter! ;-))_"
