tengusw/share_to_clipboard,open,maybe add link unshortener/tracking query param remover?,[],"i sometimes share links to websites that use tracking urls, either through a link shortener or through utm_* query parameters. i generally have to manually remove these from the link myself before sending to friends, so it'd be neat if this app could scan those urls to remove tracking stuff.

it should be simple enough to detect redirects and copy the resulting url from the Location header, and android provides handy url parsing tools you should be able to use to cleanly remove unwanted parameters"

tengusw/share_to_clipboard,closed,Increase priority in share menu,[]," This app is great and I use it quite frequently. Therefore, I would prefer if it always appeared on the first page (top 8 apps) in the share menu, so I can access it faster (although I don't want to make it the default because I don't always use it).

I'm not sure how Android decides what order to show items in / whether it's  possible to change that. If not, an alternative would be to show a ""toast with action""\* (like Firefox opening tabs in the background), where the action re-shares the content to a different app (and then I'd set this as the default).

\*I haven't looked at the code but I think it's not actually a toast, just a view shown via overlay"

tengusw/share_to_clipboard,open,Suggestion: Reverse share,[],"Hey,

just an idea. Would a reverse share be a nice-to-have feature? Basically, allow the app to take the clipboard and share it with another app. Could be very useful for apps that don't have text input (and therefore can't be pasted into) or speed up the process in some cases.

Cheers :]
