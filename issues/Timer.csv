dpadgett/Timer,open,sometimes stopwatch gets corrupted,[],"Not sure if the project is still maintained, but here I go. 

On several occasions the Stopwatch got corrupted. Either hitting Reset button wouldn't do anything. Or the Start/Stop and Reset buttons disappeared. Or all the recording laps timings would vanish, _without_ my hitting the Reset button. It happened several times already, but I don't have a recipe to reproduce just yet. All I know is that this happens when I'm using the Lap functionality for several times...

dpadgett/Timer,open,Autostart countdown timers via exported activity,[],"I was thinking about your idea to autostart countdown timers. As far as I can tell, the app ""NFC Task Launcher"" only allows you to specify an applications activity to start. It does not allow any parameters to be passed. I don't know if this is a shortcoming of ""NFC Task Launcher"" or of Android.

Alternatives:

1 - Export multiple CountdownTimerAutostartX activities for standard lengths of time. For example, CountdownTimerAutostart5minutes, CountdownTimerAutostart15minuntes, CountdownTimerAutostart60minutes. When the activity is launched, and there isn't a currently running timer, then start one for the time specified. If there is a timer running, then add the length of time to the current running timer. The user could setup a 20 minute timer by using the 5 and 15 minute NFC tags.

2 - Export a single CountdownTimerAutostart that simply takes you straight to the countdown Timer tab.

3 - No reason you can't do both 1 and 2.

Thoughts?

dpadgett/Timer,closed,Release 1.2 nfc,[],"Hi,

I forked your project to add in an auto-start stopwatch hook for NFC.

Apps like ""NFC Task Launcher"" (http://goo.gl/tH3Dx) can program an NFC tag with an application's activity. When the phone/tablet is brought near that NFC tag, the application is started at that activity.

I extended Timer to add the activity ""StopwatchAutostartActivity"" and set its ""exported"" flag to ""true"". When the app is started with this activity, the ""Stopwatch"" tab is selected. If the stopwatch is in a ""stopped"" state, then it is reset and started. If the stopwatch is in a ""started"" state, then a new ""lap"" is created.

I use this most when cooking/grilling/brewing. Throw the meat on the grill, wave the Nexus 7 over the tag, then, move on.

Thanks...

To do this we need a license text. Please add it.
