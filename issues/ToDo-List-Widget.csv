chrispbailey/ToDo-List-Widget,open,Text colour contrast in editing mode,"[Label(name=""undesirable"")]","Issue:
When editing text, font colour can clash making words difficult to read. 

Reason:
This was originally done to make the editing interface as similar to the list view as possible.

Solution:
Either force a fixed text colour when in editing mode or find a way to modify chosen colour so that it is still readable.
