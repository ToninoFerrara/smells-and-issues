1. Trail length is now limited : makes the game run longer and you get a chance to try out novel strategies, and opponents don't get to suicide as fequently as earlier.
2. Game is now on full screen.

Chluverman/android-gltron,open,Keep score between games,[],"The score is zeroed every new game. It would be nice to keep the total score together with the number of games and their difficulties (number of players, arena size, speed, ...). Then the score could be shared to challenge other players.

Chluverman/android-gltron,open,Closed-Source AdMob in GPL'd software,[],"Hey there,

I'm currently trying to add your gltron app to the F-Droid repository at www.f-droid.org. F-Droid is an Android software repository containing only free software, and as such, your app would be a perfect fit!

While integrating your app into our build process, I noticed that you are using the Google Ads SDK. While we absolutely don't mind that you want to be compensated for your hard work on the app, we unfortunately can't ship your app if it contains proprietary code. Additionally, linking the app against the closed source Google Ads library violates the GPL license put forth by original author, Andreas Umbach.

Do you think you could remove the ads or work with us to ship a version without ads?

Kind regards,

Michael

Chluverman/android-gltron,open,MediaPlayer crash reports,[],"The media player playing the music occasionally is in the incorrect state when an operation is called leading to a crash of the game. (As seen by the few crash reports from the Market place)..

Need to better utilise the sound classes callbacks and/or check required state before running operations.
