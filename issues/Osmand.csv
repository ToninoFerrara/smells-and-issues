Hello,

During this month or so I've received two OsmAnd updates: one in the beginning of the month -- I can't remember the exact day -- and the 2nd on 15th. But I noticed the interface texts have been the same since last month and there have been no commits into this Git from Weblate since 12th, even though I've submitted [a few translations](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/commits?author=igoreliezer) during the period.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,View more of upcoming route,[],"Pleas show more of upcoming route by moving user location icon automatically (prospective route viewing).

Details:
When I am navigating, I care less about what is behind me, than what is in front. I'd like a feature that shows me more of what is ahead.

I imagine it working as follows:
a) Find a desired user icon location ellipse around the center (footnote1) 
b) Sarting with the user's current location in the middle, find where the current route intersects the screen edge (footnote 2 & 3)
c) Draw a straight line from that point, past the first intersection with the desired ellipse, through the centerpoint of the screen, to the second intersection with the ellipse. 
d) Move the user's location arrow to that second ellipse intersection, and update the rest of the screen to match. (footnote 4)

This will make more of the upcoming route visible. I don'really care if it works exactly like this, I just want more of my tiny screen showing what's in front.

footnote 1) The idea is that the user's location icon will be on a point on that ellipse showing more of the upcoming route than if the icon were in the middle. I imagine this ellipse as follows: Draw both centerlines, horizontal and vertical. Where they intersect, is the center of the screen, and where the user's icon currently goes. On each centerline, mark the points halfway between the screen center, and the screen edge. In other words, the 1/4 and 3/4 points along each line. Those 4 points uniquely describe an ellipse.

footnote 2) If it's too hard to find the intersection with the real screen because of all the different screen sizes, even an imaginary rectangle that works for most screens should do the trick.

footnote 3) If there are no intersections, then the route is fully on screen and you can stop. If there are more than one intersections, pick the one closest to the straight line to the destination. 

footnote 4) This is sort of similar to the user dragging their finger on the map to move their icon there, except that it would be done automatically.



Even if this only gets updated every few seconds, it would be better than not having it.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,The repeat announcement should count its interval from the last announcement,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I have made suggestions that voice guidance should cover flyovers, underpass and lane guidance (see #6299, #6300).

If they are accepted, then OsmAnd will become more chatty. In that case, if the user activates the **repeat announcement** feature, then it should make its next announcement based on the last announcement.

For example, if the repeat interval is 5 minutes, and 3 minutes have already lapsed. 
That means the next announcement is due in 2 minutes.
At this moment, a lane change instruction is announced.
In this case, the repeat function should make its next announcement after 5 minutes; not after 2 minutes."
osmandapp/Osmand,open,The repeat voice announcement should not refer to a turn that is beyond one announcement away,[],"The voice announcement refers to the next turn, which may be several minutes away to reach.

This is fine.

But when the **repeat voice announcement** feature is activated, then the repeated reference to the same turn are not required, because the same announcement is repeated very frequently. In this mode, OsmAnd should keep the driver's focus on what to do for the next one announcement interval.

So, if the turn comes up AFTER the scheduled interval of repeat announcement, then the announcement should simply say ""continue to drive"".

If the turn is within the next announcement interval, then it should be announced."

The entrances of flyovers and underpasses can be tricky, and they also have entries on one or both sides. This requires the driver to take the correct lane as he approaches a flyover or underpass.

Therefore these features should be announced beforehand."
osmandapp/Osmand,open,The voice announcement should be provided for lane guidance also,[],"Currently the lane guidance is visual only: No voice announcements  are made when we have to take a left/middle/right lane.

The driver cannot be looking at the screen to figure out which lane he is supposed to take. That's why an audio announcement is important.

**Desired:** Please include lane guidance also as an optional item in the **Announce...** list."
osmandapp/Osmand,open,Announce the summary of the route with 3 waypoints or longest segments on the route,[],"Often the routes have too many twists and turns, which are not worth remembering. Often they are there because it was not possible to lay a straight road from point A to point B.

Nevertheless, the road takes a few key turns, and then keeps going in that general direction.
These few key turns define the shape of the route.

We can identify this general shape of a complex route with a single glance. 
We can also spot the key turns in the route.

Is it possible to replicate this in OsmAnd with an algorithm? 
Then this feature can be used to describe the route in simplified terms (just like how humans do).

Or else a simpler alternative is to identify three longest segments on the route and identify their actual sequence. This can be used in announcing the route.

For example, ""The 50 km route to the International Airport will pass though ORR, National Highway 44 and KIA road, and will take 90 minutes to complete"".

Let us call this ""Route settings"" screen. 
The purpose of this screen to set up the initial settings for the whole trip. 

The **audio** section of this screen has three issues:

**1.  Move the sound on/off button to the map screen**</br> </br>While driving, the user would need to mute the sound at a moment's notice. This is NOT a fixed choice for the whole trip. The driver should be able to mute the sound immediately. Therefore, the **sound on/off** toggle button is not needed in the **Route settings** screen. </br> </br>Instead, please provide a **speaker/mute** button on the map screen.  During navigation, it should be hidden, but when the user taps the map screen, it should pop up (just like the **map orientation** control). Thus the driver has to tap the  device twice to mute the speaker (He taps anywhere on the map screen to make the button visible, and then taps on it to mute the sound.) </br> </br>I know this can be done through **Quick Actions**, but I feel it should be a standard setting.

**2.  Move the voice guidance language control to the Navigation settings screen**</br> </br>The user would set his voice guidance language only once after he installs OsmAnd. He would not change it on a trip-by-trip basis.  </br> </br>Therefore the language-selection control should be removed from this screen. (It belongs to the **Navigation controls** screen)

**3. Move the pause music option to the Navigation settings screen** </br> </br>The third control is to choose whether to pause music. Even this is a one-time selection, not a ""per-trip"" choice. Therefore this control also should be removed from this screen. Let it be in the **Navigation controls** screen.

*********
**4. Add  ""frequency of voice guidance"" control to the Route settings screen**</br> </br>On the other hand, the ""Route settings"" screen does not provide a much-needed control: The frequency of voice guidance.

If the route is familiar, the user typically does not need voice guidance at all. 
But the more unfamiliar the route, the higher the frequency of voice guidance he needs. 

In other words, the driver needs to set the frequency of voice guidance on a ""per trip"" basis. Therefore this control should be provided on the ""Route settings"" screen."

I recommend to provide a capability for recovering map markers in case of cathastrophic incidents, similar to the capability OsmAnd offers today for favourites.

This line is needed just to complete the sequence of segment-wise addition of distance and time. 

That's why the final line only has the total distance and total time in the left column.
It never has a distance+time in the third column.
So, why does it show a zig-zag arrow icon in the second column?

An icon should be shown only if there is a movement.
Not only that, the arrow should be appropriately chosen to match the direction of movement.
(s.g. turn sharply left, turn left, turn slightly left, go straight, take a U turn, turn slightly right,...etc.)

Thus the zigzag arrow is totally redundant and misleading.

**Desired:** 
Get rid of this last directional icon.
Instead, a checkered flag can be shown to show arrival of destination.

Similarly, when we arrive at a waypoint, show the waypoint number."

The following discussion applies to the last 3 options only.

I had already suggested that these descriptions are too long, and suggested short words such as ""first waypoint"" and ""last waypoint"", but it appears that these words are already reserved in the code; and it would lead to confusion.

Other words like ""stop"", ""stopover"", ""break"", ""halt"" were not accepted for more obscure reasons.

But, IMHO, the current solution is far inferior than what I suggested. Therefore please reconsider the words I suggested earlier. Especially when the latest subtext (sort of tooltip) does use the word ""stop"", so there should not be any issue!

In particular-
- The option ""Add as subsequent destination"" is very vague; and does not imply what should happen to the current destination. Its subtext ""move destination up, and create it"" is even more confusing: The word ""it"" seems to refer to the destination that was moved up!

- The option ""Add as the last intermediate destination"" also is vague.

So, if we rephrase the 3 last options, they will become both short and easy to understand.
Here is a sample:

> **Add as ultimate/final destination.**
> The current destination becomes the last break/stop.
> 
> **Add as first waypoint/break.**
> Adds as the first break/stop in the trip/journey.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Roy_Selmon_Expressway

I'm sure there are more somewhere else in the world, too.

For now, I've been adding an opening_hours tag on the barrier nodes on the entrance lanes (and on the entrance lanes themselves) for the Atlanta express roads, mainly so that the information gets captured and is available in OSM.  I haven't touched this on the Selmon Expressway because it has a more complex reversal schedule.  I have specifically avoided putting opening_hours on barrier nodes on the exit lanes, though, because you can exit even after the barriers on the entrance lanes go down.

Another way to approach this might be to utilize route relations.  However, this is significantly more complex.

I've started a discussion on the OSM Tagging mailing list, which I invite everyone to join in on:

https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2018-November/040753.html

Now, in France, a lot of ways are adjusted regard a better quality of aerial image from IGN.

OsmAnd calculate wrongly the routes with both the old and the new way instead of the new only.
Perhaps, OsmAnd cumulates the ways of the main map and the ways of the Live map. 

Monthly update of the main map fix this issue, but Live should not keep the old ways or should tag them to prevent their use.

I try this:
1. I moved all the files (with one 25 MB sized) from net.osmand.plus/files/live to another place of my Huawei P8 phone. Then the display rendering of the map was fast. Less one second to redisplay the map when I change the position or I change the zoom. Great.
2. I put again the live files in their repository. Now,  it took 3 or 4 seconds to display the map after moving the position or after a change of zoom.

When the live update is frequent, the file sizes are enough little.
Reading of little files is less slow but the rendering speed increase between the beginning and the end of the month.

Updating the main map on the beginning of the month makes the erasing of the live files and makes again a good speed of rendering.

So I think that the live files system should be changed to increase the speed of the reading. I have no idea how.

This is an issue/request that I find confusing. I am really interested in learning more information about landmarks, sights and monuments. When one taps on a POI, different results are presented. A lot of POI have no external links whatsoever. In other cases, Wikimedia photo urls are present but not clickable. When one visits the website, one is shown wikipedia articles where the POI is listed and an external link to a national database website which talks about the POI. This is very useful and would be ideal to always include within the app if available. I also believe it would be better to swap the Wikimedia photo url, with the wikipedia article that lists the POI, although I noticed the article does not always directly concern the POI. In yet another case, the POI doesn't include any external links, but can be found listed in a Wikipedia article but without any photo, thus no Wikimedia photo url exits.

Strangely enough, it appears that there are cases for different monuments where the app does after all include direct external clickable links to the national database website I previously referred to. My question is, why is this external link present in only certain cases?

This is bad for free ride usage of this map, because I'm not able to see, whether or not I can turn at some dead end road. I'm highly dependent on this feature to find routes I can drive in order to shoot images for Mapillary. 

Here are some images that show, how it is rendered in OsmAnd and Mapnik:

As both tags should only be mapped to nodes, this could be done via an icon. Maybe this can be done with the renderer.xml. I will look into it. 

As far as I know, [highway=mini_roundabouts](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dmini_roundabout) are mapped as nodes and will be displayed with 3 blue arrows forming a circle. This may be a good starting point."

Using OsmAnd~ 3.2.2 from F-Droid (but this has been an issue for at least a year or so but finding a good reproducer wasn't trivial).
Device is Oneplus 3T. ROM is Oneplus' latest.
Reproduced on another Oneplus 3T with a recent LineageOS.

Steps to reproduce:
- enable only the world overview map,
- display Paris, France on the map,
- zoom in and select a public transport element,
- observe that osmand has frozen.

Note that this also happens when there are other maps used in addition to the world overview one but having only world overview makes for a better reproducer.

In France, quite a lot of motorcycle and bicycle parkings are actually shared, meaning that either a bike or a motorcycle can park on these stands. They are usually tagged as (you can see this around [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5028869394))

These parkings should ideally have a different marker which should represent bike and motorcycle, without giving priority to any of them.


The current actual behavior in Osmand app is that the `amenity=bicycle_parking` are rendered with a bike icon and the `amenity=motorcycle_parking` are rendered with a motorcycle icon, no matter what the rest of the tags is.

Both APIs support passing data through named variables.

Some OsmAnd features which could be accessed from an automation app are:
Map selection, zoom, jump to position, follow, mark waypoint, start/stop track recording, publish current position, day/night mode.

Examples of events to pass to the automation app: navigation started, waypoint reached, destination reached, navigation direction (message), GPS lost/found.

Neither list is comprehensive or complete, many more functions are useful to have.

Purposes of supporting such interface:
Additional means of controlling aspects of OsmAnd operation become easy to add, without modification of OsmAnd code, not even installing a different version. For example, a speech driven interface, mapping functions to bluetooth controllers, more finegrained or accurate control of map zooming by velocity, automatically starting track recording when exiting a defined geofence (and finish recording when entering the same or another), addition of a ""spool"" mechanism for sending location updates when connection is temporarily down, trigger ""keep screen on"" when moving, use display timeout when not moving etc.  
As many of those features which are often only interesting to a small subset of users can then be added according need, these interfaces may also be helpful to keep the wishlist smaller, and the code base leaner. Furthermore, level of individuality in configuring OsmAnd is extended considerably, making it in many cases unnecessary to decide on usefulness of features from majority view.

Consider also that some of those automation apps (Automagic) comes with a built-in scripting language, which can be used to control those OsmAnd features programmatically on the fly, without the need to add comparable facilities to OsmAnd.

My own motivation of suggesting addition of such an interface is that I hope to be able to reduce needed manual interaction with OsmAnd while driving, but have things happen on an event driven base, me just watching it happen. But I've been called ""lazy"" before :)

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Improve rendering of close objects / POIs to improve real life usability,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hello everyone,

at first: Kudos for the great app. I haven't found anything in an already existing issue. If I missed it, sry.

## TL;DR

Please add some indication for POI's that will not be shown because something else would overlap with it. Good example is the OSM Mapnik style, which shows purple dots in that case.

## The problem 

I use Osmand as my main OSM app on a daily basis. But there is always one thing, that really bothers me: POI's that are **close together** may **not be visible** on the map. Let me quickly give you an example (comparison of Osmand offline vector render vs. online OSM Mapnik tiles).

![osmand_mapnik_compare_lowzoom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5895949/46969295-e423a780-d0b5-11e8-8e94-7eb8ea11cf9a.png)

Here is the location shown in the images: https://osm.org/go/0Gcf~_pVt

As you can see, in the low zoom (first comparison) there are quite a lot of POI's missing in Osmand. Mapnik doesn't show the POI's in detail, but it contains these small purple dots to indicate, that something is there, but you have to zoom in. 

The second image is even worse. Now I have a quite decent zoom level for walking usage (overview of the building). I've marked the missing POI's in the OSM online tile image. **You will miss 7 out of 17 POI's in total.** This is really bad!

## Solution

Osmand would really benefit something similar to the Mapnik rendering: Please show some **indicator for the discarded POI's**. Maybe you can keep the current logic to determine, which POI's should be visible and which should not. And then show the ""not visible"" POI's as small dots for example.

If you don't, then **many users** of this app will **miss out some cool stuff** just because they haven't zoomed in to the highest zoom level in order to grasp every POI that's available. 

## Further thinking

I've read something about [custom styles](https://osmand.net/help/docs/Custom_Rendering_How-To.htm) and maybe this can be used?

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Search: some annoyances and suggestions,[],"Osmand 3.22 on Lineage 14, offline maps:

While the new all-in-one search function is a giant step forward in terms of usability and speed, there is some minor annoyances:

- When clicking on the right list item while search is not completed, Osmand often jumps to the wrong destination, as it first removes the list and redraws it before accepting the tap (which then points to another entry at the same list position). This wait until the list is completely complete needs time and leads to usage errors. Can't the list be redrawn in place, so that added items are placed on the correct position?

- Sometimes, search finds no result at all at correctly spelled names, not even the capital of the country. In thi state, no search finds any result. No idea, why this happens and how it disappears, usually after a restart it works again. Sometimes, names that are visible on the map are not found via search.

- If typing a street name, it will not be found, but only POI with that name, not even when the map already shows that street name. To find a street, first the city name has to be entered (even when in that city), then ... wait ... select the city, then enter the street name, then ... wait ... the street appears. The rule that city names are not accepted as city names when entering ""city street"" is not obvious to users. As with above behaviour, search finds insanely many POI within larger cities, a ""wrong"" search uses up to half a minute.

- Maybe, a division mark (like a comma) between items could help that the search does not use time to go the wrong way not being able to distinguish if a term with two or more words or cascaded key words are meant (New York, Main Street, London main station, San Francisco bay bridge).

- Sometimes, something like a ""rough"" or phonetic search toggle would be helpful, if the target is spelled slightly different and cannot be found, although you know, it's there.

- In larger cities with several occurrances of the same street name or with similar town names, it would be helpful to have the postal code / zip code shown as well (or to toggle the display of zip codes), otherwise one has to go through the list trial-and-error, and that needs a lot of time.

- Sorting order of the results: POI and close results seem to have highest priority. This makes it difficult to quickly find high-priority items somewhere way down (country, region, city, district, area, street name). In these cases, toggling the sorting order to alphabetically and/or type of entry would be helpful.

- A ""back"" button to jump back to the result list without having to repeat the search would often be helpful.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Handling of street name abbreviations and inconsistent naming during search,[],"In an attempt to help further improve OSMAND search, I would like to submit the following issue:

German street names such as ""Rolandstraße"", ""Hautstraße"", ... are often abbreviated to ""Rolandstr."", ""Hauptstr."". Similarly, quite often, streets are inconsistently listed as either ""Rolandstraße"", ""Roland Straße"" or ""Roland-Straße"", on/in different maps/road signs/address registers.

Especially when an address is copy&pasted into the OSMAND search box, or a search is initiated by sharing a location, abbreviated street names with the ""str."" suffix appear as inputs to the OSMANS search. Unfortunately they are not handled very well by OSMAND. A search for ""Rolandstr."", for example, does yield zero results while one for ""Rolandstraße"" or ""Rolandstr"" (without the trailing ""."") initiated at the same location does find the correct street. This is counter intuitive and makes the search function less useful than than it could be.

Similarly, when searching for an Address, it is impossible to know beforehand whether OSM will list that particular street under ""Rolandstraße"", ""Rolandstr."", ""Roland Straße"" or ""Roland-Straße"". The same happens with ""...-Ufer"" ""...-Weg"" and probably a bunch of other suffixes. All these search terms should hence be ""treated equally"" and produce identical or at least very similar results.

Would it make sense to simply ignore all non-alpha-numeric characters when comparing the search string against street names? Or maybe at least do that after a regular search didn't yield any results?"

Rationale:  Some toll roads have ""demand pricing"" where the toll varies based on traffic load (toll goes up when more vehicles take the toll rad).  While some people might be willing to pay up to a certain amount, many will have a cut-off price at which they aren't willing to pay the toll (e.g., if they have a monthly budget of how much toll they can afford).

If OsmAnd routes onto a toll road, the driver should have the option of activating a temporary ""avoid toll road"" feature with a single-button tap on the screen.  Ideally, this option should be displayed 1 to 2 miles before the junction node to the toll road, which is generally where the toll price signs are placed, along with spoken guidance ""In 2 miles, keep left onto the toll road.""  Ideally, when this button is tapped, OsmAnd should immediately speak an alternate guidance statement (which is being held in a variable in case) ""In 2 miles, continue straight on I 75"" and then temporarily toggle the ""avoid toll roads"" setting until the junction node has been passed (not unlike how the ""allow private roads"" setting gets set and then unset with your really cool allow-private-roads-for-this-trip feature).  This should (as I understand it) simply cause OsmAnd to immediately being recalculating the route with no additional work on your part (I hope).

If the driver passes the junction node without pressing the button, then it can be removed from the screen and the ""just in case"" guidance variable discarded.

Rationale:  Some places build toll roads to parallel nearby freeways/highways with the specific intent that people who are willing to pay the toll will use them to avoid traffic congestion (examples include the new I 75 Express Lanes north and south of Atlanta, Georgia).  For people who will use the toll road, this will make OsmAnd prefer the toll road over the nearby (and often at a standstill) freeway.

One advantage of making it a checkbox is that people can enable it during periods of high traffic (e.g., rush hour, road construction work) and disable it when traffic is moving smoothly.

Making this change won't affect people who already have the ""avoid toll roads"" option enabled."

Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps?

Your Offline maps

If you have an issue related to offline maps, tell us the exact name of the map file where the issue occurs, and its edition date.

US State Georgia, dated Aug. 31, 2018 (although it isn't an offline map problem).


Steps to reproduce:

1.  Enter search mode
2.  Select Categories
3.  Select a category that you know has some nearby POIs (but do yourself a favor and select one that doesn't have a lot)
4.  Scroll to the bottom of the list (this is why I suggested using a sparse category)
5.  Tap Online Search

The result is:
""Couldn't find anything:  1334385 mi""

Tapping the ""increase search radius"" button doesn't change the radius.  Also, no results are returned (see #6145), despite the fact that we're now searching a radius 168 times the Earth's diameter.  By now, Starbucks has had plenty of time to open orbital coffee shops.....

I use OsmAnd~ mainly for cycling, and record all of my trips to work (by bike of course). It was great to explore shorter/better routes.

What I hate the most when cycling, is having to stop, although slowing down is fine (I have an old racing bycicle with poor brakes and due to my saddle setting I'm quite unstable when at a stop. But anyway those are my personal preferences, the user is king, you shouldn't be questioning that).

So I'm currently trying to determine, among the alternative routes that I've tried, which one is statistically the best in terms of the number of stops.

For this use case, __what I would love to have is a heat map on the track in function of speed__. (That could be an added option of the ""Color"" drop down).

À la runtastic ![runtastic track speed heat map screenshot](https://www.amstore.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Runtastic-maps.png)

Of course that feature could be useful for a lot more use-cases.

Let's say that I want to search for a street in Oslo (Norway). I assume that I have to first select city and then street. (This assumption is normal, isn't it, for a user in general, and also because on the ADDRESS tab of the main search page, OsmAnd offers both SELECT STREET in .... and SELECT CITY.)
When I see SELECT STREET IN ""some other city"", I assume that first I have to change that other city into the one that I want to search in now.
- Tap Search (magnifier glass)
- ADDRESS tab
- SELECT CITY
- Type city or town: Oslo
- Tap on result: Oslo (City)
- Tap on SHOW OSLO ON THE MAP
It shows Oslo on the map. Good! Now, at this stage, I assume that I am done selecting city, and can now concentrate on selecting street in that city. 
On the screen I see at the top

<-- Oslo        X
SHOW OSLO ON THE MAP

I do not want to scroll, I want a text field where I can write the street name to search for. 
(And besides, I wonder: Why does it propose to SHOW OSLO ON THE MAP when that is what I just did?)

ISSUE 1 (minor): Why propose to do again what it just did, i.e., SHOW 'found city' ON THE MAP?

Particularly, I want to tap the SELECT STREET on the main search page, ADDRESS tab.

I continue like this:
X (upper right corner) to get done with selecting City and get to the main search page.

It takes me to the main search page.
It is still on the ADDRESS tab, which is fine.
Here is the SELECT STREET that I want.
However, it does **not** say
SELECT STREET IN OSLO
actually, it says
SELECT STREET IN **BERGEN**
because some time earlier today I was searching in Bergen.

**ISSUE 2: After selecting a new city, it proposes the previous city for SELECT STREET**

One more little issue:
I saw different behavior if I searched for Oslo or Orkanger in the SELECT CITY search. After the Oslo search and tapping on the search result it offered me to SHOW OSLO ON THE MAP. After the Orkanger search and tapping on the search result it went straight to showing Orkanger on the map. Why?
I did this many many times back and forth, Oslo, Orkanger, Oslo, Orkanger, Oslo, Orkanger, Oslo, Orkanger. Via SELECT CITY. 100% reproducible.

ISSUE 3: Some searches offer SHOW xxx ON THE MAP, others just go straight to the map

Now, my final searches were like this:
- SELECT CITY
- Oslo
Result:
Oslo \n City \n Could not find anything: 10.0 km

I.e., it both found Oslo and could not find anything
I got this result several times, over and over again.

ISSUE 4: It reports both that it found the city that I searched for and that it can not find anything.


**REBOOT OSMAND**


ISSUE 3 vanished after reboot. The search for Orkanger now offered SHOW ORKANGER ON THE MAP.
Although it was 100% reproducible as described above, it vanished after reboot.

ISSUE 4 vanished after reboot.
After reboot it went like this:
- SELECT CITY
- Oslo
Result:
Oslo \n City \n Increase search radius

ISSUE 1 and ISSUE 2 are still reproducible after reboot.
If I were a OsmAnd developer I would start with ISSUE 2. (But do not forget the others).

Anyway, OsmAnd is awesome. I use it every day. Thanks to the developers who give us this nice product!

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Suggestion: Distinguish between paved and unpaved cycleways,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi there,

I often use Osmand when planning my cycling trips. When using my road bike I try to avoid unpaved roads which is currently impossible with cycleways as they are always shown as a blue dashed line, no matter of their surface. So my suggestion is to distinguish cycleways in a similar way at it is done with tracks, where the paved ones are marked with a solid line and the unpaved ones with dashed lines. For example, cycleways tagged with ""surface=paved"", ""surface=asphalt"", ""tracktype=grade1"" or similar could be shown as a solid blue line, while any other cycleways (including those with no information about its surface) keep their current appearance as dashed blue lines.

This would improve the app a lot for road cyclists as they can use cycleways if they are known to be paved.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,TTS messages with numbers of roads use wrong forms in Polish language,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","This is probably going to be very hard to describe, as the problem is specific to some languages only and English is definitely _NOT_ one of them.

Let's say that there's a road called ""Szosowa"" and it's number is 796.

https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.38025&mlon=19.28503#map=17/50.38025/19.28503

Now the problem is not entirely on OsmAnd side (I'm using OsmAnd+, but I guess this doesn't matter anyway), but probably also in the Google's TTS engine. The issue here is that in Polish language OsmAnd sometimes says the routing instructions as if the road number - 796 - was not a number but the amount of something. This is the tricky part to describe (; Instead of giving instructions like ""skręć w lewo w siedemset dziewięćdziesiąt sześć Szosowa"" (""turn left to seven hundred ninety six Szosowa"") it says something like ""skręć w lewo w siedmiuset dziewięćdziesięciu sześciu Szosowa"". This is impossible to easily translate to show the problem, but instead of using ""siedemset dziewięćdziesiąt sześć"" as a 796 number (raw number, with no grammar transformations) it says ""siedmiuset dziewięćdziesięciu sześciu"", as if it meant there are 796 ""somethings"" (for example as in the name of the ""12 Angry Men"" movie the ""12"" refers to the amount of people involved). This sounds really silly...

What I was thinking, maybe it would be possible to alter the generated strings before feeding them to the TTS engine so that it would pronounce the number of the road as a raw number? Maybe it would be enough to insert a coma (semicolon?) before and after the number, or maybe alter the string otherwise (move the number to the end? put it in parentheses, surround it with dashes? ...?)."

Offline maps.

---

In OsmAnd I have enabled the feature to turn of the screen after some period of inactivity. This works well, with very minor glitches. In my phone I have also enabled the lock screen (I need to ""swipe"" a proper pattern to unlock it or use my fingerprint). Now the issue happens sometimes in the following scenario:
1. I navigate to somewhere
2. During the period od navigation the screen was disabled at least once.
3. The navigation ends (either canceled or I reached my destination).
4. I want to access the phone now so I either quit OsmAnd or use the ""home"" button of the phone.

In this scenario _SOMETIMES_ an infinite race condition appears. The screen shows the map for a split second, then the lock screen (usually with a notification bar about a new e-mail, SMS message or sth like that), then the map again, then the lock screen, and this goes on forever. To quit I actually have to reboot the phone. This does not happen always, but I'd say that in 2 out of 3 cases.

If this happens, the next time I start OsmAnd I'm offered to send a crash report (which I did some time ago) - I attach the file that I sent back then, maybe it will be useful.

It crashed. It seems that it's due to the RAM being full, `std::bad_alloc` is thrown.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8378797/stdbad-alloc-am-i-using-too-much-memory

If it's catchable maybe there is a chance to inform the user instead of looking like OsmAnd has a bug?
Because it seems to be and often cause of crash (unavoidable due to the task itself and the hardware)
Some ideas:
- manage to kill/let die the routing process gracefully without bringing the app itself down. And inform the user about a failure due to the lack of memory
- save the info somewhere before the app gets killed. So on next start when can inform the user that the crash was due to lack of RAM
- when routing isn't very quick, periodically check for available RAM and record if it's low. So on restart after a crash we can say that the crash was probably due to lack of RAM (← this seems at bit flaky)

Here is what you need to do

1.Osmand should download addr:full and [show it underneath a search results](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/6013)

2. Pressing on a map, ""locating address"" should locate addr:full if it is closer than a far away street. This also intertwines with the addr:place issue.

3. It should also be able to get search results from searching a part of that addr:full.

E.g.Shop No. 16, Ganga Vishnu Sankul CHS, Pune - 411052

Search ""Shop No 16, ganga vishnu sankal"" should get you the correct result - which is a shop called [""Nourish""](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5796441179#map=19/18.49242/73.82460).

I would like it to say and show the speed limit in the local format/units.
Perhaps this should be considered a Feature request, can a toggle setting be made, ""Rigid"" or ""Only show"" , so that the speed units can switch to read the same numbers as seen on the signs?
Without stopping the navigation, going into settings in 2 places, and switching the units every time I cross the border. That would kinda mess up being able to project my arrival time.

After a while one can see that the map is first being centered and in a glimpse of a fraction of a second _there is a perfectly centered map there_. But then this map is _blanked out_, and a (slow) redrawing is done. Maybe this blanking and redrawing is redundant and can be avoided.

As a follow-up to #5957, I have ran a quick comparison test and it seems there are still quite some regressions of JS versions vs. the long-tested old ones. Let me collect here the findings so we can tackle one by one:

**Grammar:**

- (G1) de_tts.js: The Prolog logic of needing masculine/feminine/no article depending on the Ref/Name/Dest combination seems to have been ported with a bug.

**Wording:** (Not a good time to change long stable wording at the time of the js porting ...)

- (W1) de_tts.js: Now uses ""einordnen"" instead of ""halten"" for ""keep"". Need to check with the community if we like the new wording, and test if it fits all real.life situations.

**Rounding:**

- (R1) Distance, all languages, I guess: The sanity-checked rounding scheme we had in Prolog seems to be ported with a glitch. It rounded to e.g. the nearest 50m for 100m>x>100m, reflecting that the accuracy of GPS, the time how long a prompt sounds, and the speed of travel all create uncertainty. It seems different now, we announce e.g. ""370"" instead of ""350"", i.e. we bother drivers with a 5% difference which is invalid anyway vs. the uncertainty. (Hope we do not announce ""377"" :) )
- (R2) Time rounding, return result: ""Dot nought"" issue, see #5985

Note to testers: My old **Voice system info:** button 11.1 on the Test Voice Prompts menu does not display if the JS or Prolog file is being tested. When comparing both, it is advisable to move the old `_ttsconfig.p` Prolog file to a separate voice folder like e.g. en_old-tts.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,City choice in address search occasionally leaves address search and diverts to map,[],"## Sample user journey

(UI texts re-translated from German, may not be correct)

I am currently in town A and want to view an address in town B. (B may be close to A or quite far away.)

I go to ""search by address"" and notice ""look for street in town C"" (whatever a previous search had been).

So I understand I'm in the wrong town context and need to set the right town first. There is a UI element ""choose town"", so I hit that. I enter the first few letters of my town B. Soon, B appears on the list of places that is being displayed. I hit that list item.

Expectation: That town is now pre-selected (instead of the no-longer relevant C) and I can start typing the street. 

Actually seen: Sometimes it works that way, but sometimes, I'm being taken to the map and the town center is displayed. Rather annoying, not helpful, if it its a ~200000 people town with many more than two or three streets. I am not presently able to predict, let alone control, which of the two happens for which place.

When I'm thrown into the map, and I navigate back to the address search, it is still town C that's pre-selected. So, from my user experience point of view, my choice of town has been ignored.

## Specific example

For an example for B where things don't work well, load the map Europe / Germany / Nordrhein-Westfalen. I have the standard map as of 01.08.2018.  The town B = ""Mülheim an der Ruhr"" (there are several ""Mülheims"") is a town for which I have these problems. In case that helps, one of B's streets is called Sandstraße .

Oddly enough, using former West-German capital Bonn for town B works much as it should.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,When updating maps (OsmAnd+ version) the previous file remains open,[],"When downloading offline maps, the files are replaced and the previous files are erased. However, the old files are kept open (the app holds a file descriptor open to it). This causes the filesystem to keep the files around until the last fd is closed, even if they are not reachable anymore in the /sdcard/osmand/ directory.

This will cause the device to run out of space if the free space is not enough to download all the pending maps while keeping the previous ones (not just the space needed for the incremental size). A workaround is to close the app and re-open it, so the old files are released when the process ends and the filesystem can free that space.

To reproduce this issue follow these steps:
1. open a shell, check the free space on the device (df /sdcard). Note the free size.
2. Open OsmAnd
3. ""Download Maps"" -> ""Updates"", update a few maps, note the download size.
4. go back to the shell and type ""df /sdcard"". The free space went down by the download size (more actually).
5. Close OsmAnd (simply swipe it away).

I made a test of the notes plugin for use in recording audio notes synchronized with a recorded GPX track to load into JOSM for updating the map from one's notes.  Before I located the ""export gpx + audio"" feature I first tried opening the audio note and using the 'share this' button here:

![screenshot_20180823-211808](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/305956/44559896-e94e2100-a71a-11e8-965a-ef56ed85f84c.png)

to attach the audio note file to an email in K9-Mail.

I was expecting the attachment in K9-Mail to have the on device ""encoded"" name holding the gps point location of the file (i.e., the The ZZabc123-.1.3gp name).  Instead, I was surprised to see the name that ended up in K9-Mail was a five digit number (42752).

If I use the ""share"" button located at the ""My Places"" -> ""Notes"" screen, and then select the same audio file, I get the gps encoded full name in K9-Mail.  So OsmAnd is capable of passing the full original filename on to K9-Mail.  It really should pass along the real filename (the gps encoded one) when using the share button on the ""play this audio clip"" screen as well.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,UI Painpoints: Inability to copy addresses creates huge user friction and makes app useless,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","One thing that has always kept me on Google maps and never using Osmand as my default map is that Osmand has anti-features restricting the ability to copy addresses. For example of a common use-case:

1. A location is received via whatsapp / telegram, etc. It opens in OSM

2. The addresses displays and map goes to the specific location

3. PROBLEM: OSM provides no ability to copy the address. Sometimes the address needs to be edited. Sometimes it needs to be pasted into other applications such as conversations or uber, etc.

Other mapping platforms do not have anti-features like this. They will let the user copy the address. Usually this is done by long-pressing the address

Strangely, OSM will let a user copy the latitude and longitude. However, the address it restricts the users ability to copy.

Even clicking ""directions"" and changing the view to the direction screen will restrict the users ability to copy. It will display the address in the ""To"" or ""From"" field but it will restrict any user attempt to copy that address. A complete anti-feature.

OSM is the only mapping application that does this and it probably prevents a lot of people from utilizing it as their primary app. It basically becomes a useless applciation for a lot of use cases.

Want to use OSM to find a restaurant and take an Uber to it? IMPOSSIBLE. Better use google maps or any other competing alternative because there is no way to go from OSM to Uber due to the anti-copying anti-features in OSM.

It could be until 500 km/h or more!
On some short route, the simulation could be almost unusable or not easy to use.

Expected: I suggest that the speed should vary not more than 10% to 120% of the maxspeed of the way with a increasing or decreasing curve more or less near the reality.

On some time, exceeding the maxspeed  is a good thing to test the speed sign icon apparition and the warning voice.

1. Finding an address

- type in ""gore end"": results in zero hits within 6.21 mi 
- select ""increase search radius"" and there are some results within 6.21 mi 
? So OSMAND knows of ""gore end ..."" near Newbury but doesn't show it?

2. Finding a category 
- locate yourself in the UK 
- select magnifying glass 
- select ""Categories"" and pick ""Public Transportation"" 
- enter ""airport"" and search 
- increase the radius as much as you like: you never see an airport (but lots of bus stops and ...) 
- alternatively, select mag.glass and simply type in ""Oxford airport"" - without having to increase radius there it is, 2nd entry?

 What is the point of categories if they don't narrow the search domain?

6. The view moved to where the track would've been but no track was displayed

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Problem with large SQLITE tiles db: write mode index/temp files too big/slow,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hello,
This is a very old problem I already had:

When using large (1GB+) SQLITE tiles database on smartphone, Osmand my hang when switching from the Sqlite map to another map (for example to a vector one). It may also hang when switching to the Sqlite map or at random other time.

Another, related problem, is that the map is taking a lot more space than it should.

I think the problem is that the Sqlite database is in read/write mode and it's trying to create temporary files (wal / shm) that can themselves take several GB. Smartphone storage aren't fast enough to handle it.

A temporary work-around is to set the ""tiles"" directory and the SQLite files in it as read only. That will prevent Osmand from writing to it and the base will be opened (I think) in read only mode. But that's not that easly to do on non-rooted Android phone.

It would be great to have an option to open Sqlite maps into read only mode to avoid this problem. (And because we often don't need/want to modify/update those databases if we create them with a tool on a computer)"

`262800 min * 60 * 1000 = 15768000000`,
it's way bigger than 4-bytes `int` can consume. I'd change the var type to `long`

The case of a not allowed direction is interesting here, because this is due to a problem in OpenStreetMap, so the better thing to do is to fix this error directly on the project's main site, but we don't have necessarily the time to do it at the moment we reached our destination (or, at least, we may have forgotten it).

osmandapp/Osmand,open,[Feature Request] Osm Editing: Allow converting (address) nodes to POI,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","In the Netherlands, address nodes are automatically imported into Osm from the official government database. This means that for each official house number, there is a pre-existing Osm node on the map. When mapping POIs, it is recommended to add additional tags onto these address nodes, rather than creating additional POI nodes (at least for the common case where a single house number contains a single shop or other POI).

Currently (3.0.4), OsmAnd allows selecting these house number nodes (which are shown as type ""Location""), but when I want to add POI information I can select ""Create POI"", which creates a new, blank node, without any address information.

The easiest way to fix this would be let a ""Location"" node (e.g. a node with an address, I presume) be flagged as an existing POI when determining whether to show the ""Create POI"" or ""Modify POI"" action. Then you can just select ""Modify POI"" to modify the existing node, rather than having to create a new one."

 - To remember the previously used value for ""source"", since you will likely be doing multiple uploads from the same kind of source (e.g. after surveying, or working from local knowledge, or from gps data, etc.).

Additionally, adding a checkbox that sets `review_requested=yes` on a changeset might be useful for novice mappers. This is also already implemented in the iD default editor on openstreetmap.org.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,[Feature Request]: Option to disable pinch and/or slide zooming,[],"I've been quite happily using OsmAnd for referencing the map on my bike (not actually using the turn-by-turn navigation, for the challenge of manual routing and to save battery on GPS). I had OsmAnd running on tablet that was mounted on my handlebar, allowing one-handed operation.

One issue that I kept running into is that when scrolling the map, it would zoom instead of scroll, which completely throws my view off from where I want to look and (also because my tablet is old and slow) is tricky to correct again on the fly.

I was under the impression that this was because my tablet's touch screen (under the influence of heat and sweaty fingers) would detect a pinch zoom gesture rather than a scroll. Since pinch zooming is not really usable while riding anyway (I use the plus and minus buttons), I wanted to propose to add an option to disable pinch zooming altogether, which should prevent this issue.

However, while searching for existing issues, I leared about ""slide zoom"" (tap and drag to start zooming with one finger), wich is *probably* what was happening in my case (on bumpy roads, it is easy to accidentally double tap when trying to tap or drag). I'm not entirely sure, though, it might still be accidental pinch zooming.

Hence my request: Can you add options to disable pinch zooming and slide zooming? I would suggest adding them as separate options, giving users maximum flexibility. As an added advantage, adding option to disable slide zooming would at the same time make the feature more discoverable, which helps for #3829."

I have another issue with the Osmand Plus app. It is in my case not a new thing, [I struggle with it now since a while](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/4537), found a work around that helps me though. I believe it is related to my phone (Sony XA F3111 Android 7.0) since I saw another comment with the same issue under the app ratings.

I am not able to download / update maps to my external sd-card. Everything works fine as long the internal storage is used, but it fails as soon I try to set up the external storage. I already tried different sd-cards and the permission to write to the sd-card is granted as well. All other apps that are using the sd-card as storage are working fine except Osmand and since the internal storage is limited is there no way around to just use the external storage to store the maps.

As soon the download of a map supposed to be finished an error appears (I/O error: old file can’t be deleted) and nothing happens, even if there is no old file in existence.

My workaround is now to go to the storage with a file explorer and remove the extension *.download of the just downloaded map and restart the app. It works now, but slightly inconvenient. 

I even tried to do a fresh set up of Osmand, but even here it was not possible to get it to work. It is even worse, since the download is then trapped in a loop and starts over again and again without to finish at all.

This is perfectly legal and verified at
http://projets.pavie.info/yohours/
see next figure.
This restaurant is closed on Monday and Sunday. The opening hours is first given as a general 16:00-24:00; and then overridden by more specific times for Fr and Sa, and finally Mo,Su off. Rules following a semicolon override those before it. The screenshot was taken on Sunday at 15:50. The restaurant was then closed. The problem is that the status says that it opens at 14:00. Where does that come from? The only 14:00 is on Saturday. Besides that, it was Sunday, and it does not open the next day (no day is shown so that would be the same or next day), it opens two days later (Tue) at 16:00. (I recommend showing a day when first opening is not later on the current day).

Screenshot later on Sunday. Here the open/closed status in OsmAnd says that the restaurant is open, but that is wrong. It only displays the first rule (Mon-Sun 16:00-24:00) and skips the following overriding rules.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,[Feature request] Add a combined navigaion engine (OSMAND + YOURS),[],"### (This shouldn't be hard to implement and would be of major help on longer routes)
### (I'd code it myself if I knew how to)

Hello,

I am a long-time user of OSMAnd and seen as I frequently make long trips, I thought of a feature that would help greatly when calculating long distances.

The feature I am talking about would be the possibility of merging together OSMAND's offline nav service with the YOURS online one, in-app. 

This would work like that:

The majority of the trip would be calculated using YOURS (it's very quick when it comes to >1k km trips) so that OSMAND doesn't have to try and calculate it for 10 minutes or more (and recalculate when going off the track), but the 5-10 km fragment from the user's current location would be calculated using OSMAnd, because it's much more accurate.

Example of OSMAnd vs YOURS? Roundabouts. OSMAnd interprets them as what they are, which is roundabouts, but YOURS just marks them as turns.

Also, when the road is curved, but without any additional roads connecting to them, OSMAnd keeps silent, while YOURS alerts of every single curve saying ""turn left"" or right, which gets annoying quickly.

I don't think it would be hard to implement a combined nav engine and it would be of great help, especially on long roads.

The selected place is https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5056825778 and the name spells like this:

- U+0074 LATIN SMALL LETTER T
- U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E
- U+006C LATIN SMALL LETTER L
- …

While the rendering of the word “Hôtel” is correct in the info box, it is wrong on the map: The circumflex accent is actually shift to the right. But it should be instead in the middle above the “o”.

Of course you could argue that it would be simpler to have used `U+00F4 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX` directly instead of combining a simple “o” with a combining accent. (In this particular case I added the node using Osmand 2.7.5 and the Africa keyboard I had loaded at this time in my mobile phone only allowed this type of accents.) But I think there are two arguments for proper support of combing accents:
- It is valid Unicode. So Unicode-compatible software should render it correctly.
- It is _not_ a corner case. Of course for the Latin script in practice there will be not so much elements in OSM that actually use combining accents. But that is very different for other, more complex scripts! There, rendering would become much better.

As the screenshot shows, Osmand is yet able to render it correctly in the info box. So it would be great if we could get the same rendering also on the map itself."

- First one is fine in principle, perfectly follows channels in the Venice lagoon. But is of course not the short path most boats would actually take between start and destination. (Channel seems over-preferred)
- Second one is even worse: Routing prefers going up and down an inland river, rather than leading to the destination point.
- Third one routes partially over land, then perfectly follows a narrow bay, then again fails to lead to the final destination.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Make a form to send faulty routing to osmand team,[],"@scaidermern suggested [something quite brilliant](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/2625#issuecomment-407387200) in this comment, and I think the osmand website should have a form to do what he suggested. 

He suggested that to improve the routing algorithm, the team needs to collect a large number of tests.

I think a form on the website would do that quite nicely.

The form should require users to upload a gpx file of the faulty routing. (Next to that section there should be a little link ""How do I obtain this?"" which will give step by step instructions with gifs on how to save / share the faulty routing's gpx file and send it to your computer.)

The form should require a email, so the team can contact the user if needbe. It must also require a description telling the team what is wrong and a screenshot showing the team what is wrong. Another field that should be required is a link / screenshot of routing on openstreetmap.org to show this is not a osm error but as osmand one.

The last thing I think the form should have is two input-boxes, one asking for the lattitude, longitude of the place you wer routing from, and the latittude, longitude of the place you were routing to.

The app should possibly notify the user somehow that there is a form online to submit faulty routing. That would also be necessary.

Once you have multiple instances of faulty routing, you can start tinkering with the engine to see what fixes all / most of these. This is much more accurate than fixing each routing issue one by one and relying on small sample sizes (e.g #2625)

EDIT: One more thing, have a dropdown with options of what kind of routing error it is, e.g ""inefficient route"", ""avoids traffic lights unnecesarily"" etc."

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Dual carriageway junctions - look ahead for 'name' and 'destination' for better turn instructions,[],"As discussed on SotM:
[<img src=""https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/7/7c/Dualjunction.svg/144px-Dualjunction.svg.png"">](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Dualjunction.svg) [<img src=""https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/6/6f/Doublejunction.svg/198px-Doublejunction.svg.png"">](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Doublejunction.svg)

[Dual carriageway junctions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Junctions#Dual_carriageway_intersections) contain inner segments, m, n, p, q in the images above. These are not real roads, they are routing _abstractions_ from the junction area (grey in the images). 

As they don't exist in reality, naming them is ambiguous and done differently by mappers. In particular, for m an n, mappers either randomly chose B-Road or C-Road, or assign no name at all. 

Further, _destination_ can only be tagged for the outer way segments, leaving the junction, as the inner segments can lead to multiple destinations. 

This leads to the problem that only for a right turn, the correct name and destination can be announced. For the left turn, the name might be misleading, and the destination cannot be announced. 
(The above applies to right-hand traffic and needs to be mirrored for left-driving countries)

**Proposed Solution:**
* Recognise the inner sections of a junction, e.g. using the following heuristics:
** The length of the segment is relatively short (as long as the roads are wide, could be scaled with the number of lanes being crossed)
** The segment touches a carriageway with the same name twice, i.e. when routing h-q-m-a, segment m touches B-Road at both ends
* Ignore any name or direction on the inner segment, m in the example, and look ahead for the segment outside the junction, a in the example
* Thus h-q-m-a can be announced as ""Turn left into A-Road towards A-Town"""

They probably aren't displayed because something else is at the same location (street label, bench, information, picnic table, ...). Sometimes they show up when switching to a different zoom level (because street labels move), but sometimes the don't show up at all.
In my opinion, the cycling node numbers are the most important feature of the cycling routes. Could you force them to be displayed on top? If forced on top, they could obscure other items at the same location, but maybe that can be solved with a quick action to toggle all text (street labels, cycling node numbers) on/off?

It would be nice to let Osmand predict the next position and smooth scroll (almost) perfectly as the next position arrives from GPS.

[Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter): The math behind Kalman Filter may look scary and complicated, but the idea is rather simple. It uses current value and difference from previous value (the first derivation) to extrapolate the next value. In Osmand's case it means that the next position to be received from GPS is likely to be last known position plus last known speed multiplied by GPS update interval. There will be (small) error in the extrapolation when speed changes, but it can be easily compensated during the next update by adding acceleration (the second derivation) into the calculation.

The proposal: Use (simplified) Kalman Filter to smoothly scroll map when moving. Then when moving at any constant speed the map scroll position will perfectly match the real current position. The GPS updates will no longer be noticable."

And yes, splitting that 120mb map into 6 regions is definately over the top, but you only have to split it twice (Something like ""East Of England - North"" containing  Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk & ""East of England - South"" containing Essex, BedfordShire and Hertfordshire) and many users would appreciate such small changes.


It is necessary that all regions should have sub-regions that are less than 100mb to download.

Definitely not. Maps.Me IMO (and my other peoples opinion) is a lot easier to use then osmand, and osmand has the advantage here. Once you download the basemap (which is too big  #5650), then you can tap on areas which are downloadable and then they turn yellow. This is very useful to determine which region you want to download, so I don't think it will be that confusing. Not to mention if users are unsure they can still download the whole map anyway. (And then maybe de-activate maps to see the unnecessary maps they have downloaded.)

not sure if this is the Exception reporter from OsmAnd or from the device, but I think this is definitely helpful.

What I have noticed is that it might be because of wifi being enabled. (it wasn't enabled last week) It had crashed about 3 times (but I couldn't save the stacktrace because I was in the middle of the Autobahn) but after disabling wifi it ran fine. Maybe this could also be caused by the GPX tracking extension in there because I enabled it to save a track and live upload it via an HTTP address.

What I also noticed was that after crashing, restarting & recalculating the route it tried to send me the wrong direction through a ""one-way street"" (it tried to make me do a 150 degree turn on the Autobahn into the Auffahrt in the other direction), but when I checked the osm data where I believed it happened, everything was a one-way (though I can't really say that for sure, but maybe if there is some different logic in the re-routing algorithm it might be worth investigating there)"
osmandapp/Osmand,open,Overheat during navigation with Caterpillar CAT S60,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi,

I have an issue with overheating during navigation. (Phone type: Caterpillar CAT S60)

I was using Osmand on my bicycle in the bicycle navigation mode with offline map. After approximately half an hour of navigation I took my phone out of the bracket and noticed that it was extremely hot. On the screen was a warning message like ""battery overheat, try to close applications"". (Unfortunately I did not take a screenshot). I have not had this issue with other applications up to now (I have this phone for a year now). 
(I also repeated bicycle navigation with my old Samsung Xcover3 and did not detect overheat problems with it.)

The Caterpillar CAT S60 has a very bright display and I switched brightness to the maximum to be able to read it during cycling. When I looked at the battery usage it told me that Osmand and the display took most battery up to now (osmand 3% of battery capacity, display 3% of battery capacity during this half an hour after start (all the other applications had 1% or less). After overheat I restarted my phone, switched display to lowest brightness and later even switched the display off completely. The phone still got warm, but there was no overheat ing any more.

I think the combination of power drain of the display and the power drain of the graphic calculation of osmand were too much for the battery. Unfortunately I need maximum brightness to be able to read the phone trough the cover of the bicycle bracket.
Is there a way to reduce power usage of the navigation, at least in bicycle mode? For example I would like to reduce the frequency of position updates (since I am quite slow a lower update frequency of the screen would be acceptable). 

**Could you add an option in the properties like ""adjust position update frequency"" (e.g. update every 2 sec / every 5 sec)?**

Phone: Caterpillar CAT S60

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Rethink map markers,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I often encounter users struggling with our concept of 'map markers' vs. Favorites.

While everybody seems to understand 'Favorites' and '(Search)  History', mostly because of their intutive use also in  many other apps and most notably in web browsers,  there is a certain degree of confusion about map markers and their intended use or benefit, and partially redundant functionality.

I personally also feel there is some breach in consistency with room for consolidation and simplification.  Basic ideas and more clarity could  be achieved by somehow  merging map markers and the functionality we have developed for them into Favorites.

Basic ideas:
- Could make map markers simply a sub-category of Favorites, used for more transiently used/marked points than the 'real' Favorites in manually created categories
- Could merge the as of now completely separate map marker history into our overall History. Having two history strains is not too intuitive.
- Could make some of the cool features we had developed for map markers like the optional top bar with distance and direction info for the last 2 points selected available for all Favorites

Overall I think there is considerable room for improvement here without sacrificing any functionality?"

-Option set None
After the wrong turn, the application guides me toward the ending point.
->OK (but this is not what I am looking for)

**Test 2:
-One unique option set ""Follow whole track""
After the wrong turn:
   the application says ""recalculating"" (KO)
   an arrow is displayed toward the ending point crossing buildings (means recalculation?)
   when back on track the ""wrong"" arrow is still there (->KO).
   ""recalculating messages keep going on""
   (I just need  a message saying ""you're out of the track"" WITHOUT any (forever?) recalculation)
->KO

Test 3:
-One unique option set ""Follow whole track""
-I start exactly on the track somewhere between the starting and ending points
There is a calculation of the route (arrow pointing towards the end; messages ...)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Insane space requirements,[],"Storage requirements for OSMAND are insane. The base-map takes around 300mb, and the East of England map takes around 200mb. The roads only maps takes 80mb, which is very big for a roads only map.
Overall Osmand takes 1.2 gigabits of storage! This is simply for the necessary maps (roads only maps I find unusable). So for my family who I have got osmand, I haven't got the world base-map, because it is too big.
Lets look at a [maps](https://gitlab.com/axet/omim) (100% FOSS fork of maps.me) comparison.

East of England (full) is two maps 36mb + 46mb which is 82mb total.

World base-map is 40 MB .

The app takes around 80mb.
The MapsWithMe folder (I sent it to the computer to check the size) takes around 200mb (193mb precise)

200 + 80 = 280mb

So MapsME = 280mb
Osmand = 1.19 GB

See the insane difference?

I realize Maps.Me contains less data, but probably not 5x less data...

And especially for the world basemap, which shouldn't have to be so detailed - 
Here is a map of moscow. I have not downloaded any part of Russia, this is simply the level of detail from the World Basemap. I think that is really high, especially for a region that I will never want.

You could simply reduce the world basemap data a bit, and it would take a lot less space.

OsmAnd+ 3.0.4, released 2018-06-11

When I've already dowloaded the roads only map of a country, for instance cyprus (15 MB), and for some reason want to upgrade to the full/standard map, i have to download the complete package of almost 30 MB instead of downloading the missing 15 MB on top of the roads only map.

- Thus, especially when it comes to highly detailed maps with several hundred MB, you've to kinda re-download all the info that is already present on your device

- Like shown in the screenshot, the roads only map co-exists with the full map (after dowloading the full/standard map version with already installed roads only version).

- If roads only and the standard map are both activated, are they both used simultaneously for routing?

Would it be possible to add a ""upgrade to standard"" and ""downgrade to roads only"" option in order to switch more easily between the maps? This might also result in a significant a reduction in traffic volume on the map servers

I use the **GMD Immersive** app (v.1.5) to hide the Android bottom ""**Navigation Bar**"" and the Android top ""**Status Bar**"", thus using a full immersive in every app. This worked well with OSMAnd version **2.6.5**: I can see the full immersive map both in browsing and in navigation mode.
When I installed OSMAnd **3.0.3** the full immersive mode works only in browsing mode (despite a shadow box remains in the top Status Bar space). But when I switch in navigation mode, the OSMAnd app cannot expand into the bottom Navigation Bar, which remains visible. Even when the GMD Immersive hides the Navigation Bar, the map does not expand and a black box remains in to bottom part of the screen.
The problem exists even without the GMD Immersive app: the map expands in browsing mode, but does not expand to the bottom in navigation mode.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Routing penalities for turn angles,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I have previously raised this on #5332,  but that issue got closed after a map change fixed that specific mis-routing. I am raising this as a general routing issue. In many places I have seen osmand planning routes which include acute angles. 

I first spotted this when expecting Osmand to take this route: https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=graphhopper_car&route=50.90460%2C-1.33822%3B50.90543%2C-1.33930#map=19/50.90518/-1.33908 but instead of taking the right turn onto the service road, Osmand preferred to carry on for 50m, make a u-turn (160° turn) onto the other carriageway, then take a left turn onto the service road. I guess Osmand thought 100m of highway=secondary was better than 10m of service road. In other circumstances skipping a tiny service road segment would   be a good choice, but in this case the 160° turn makes it silly.

Arguably this case was a map bug, and I fixed it (ages ago) by adding a turn restriction. But I have seen the same thing in other cases where Osmand picked an acute turn which was technically legitimate. Legitimate, but in practice slower than alternatives. Osmand simply doesnt realise that sharp turns are slow.

#4896 is the background to my investigation into this issue. Osmand //does// have some logic checking turn angle, but the code is misleading, the angle thresholds seem wrong, and the penalties are counterproductive for (I understand) compatibility reasons.


Since January I have been experimenting with a modified routing.xml which seems to have fixed this for me. I have set:
1. `rightTurn=""0"" `. #4896 tells us that this field is nothing to do with right turns, but rather a penalty that gets applied for turns which are between 90° and 120° (in either direction). Many roads join at nominal right angles, so it seems irrational to have a penalty conditionally applied depending whether the angle is slightly above, or slightly below 90°.
2. `leftTurn=""600""`. This is a penalty applied to turns above 120° (in either direction).

That's all with standard code and modified routing.xml. My next step (which I havent yet had free time for) would be modify the code with a softer turn penalty profile. Something like:
* zero turn penalty up to maybe 45°
* A turn penalty that gradually ramps up at something like 0.5 second per degree, from 45° up to 105°. This is a normal range of road corners.
* A much steeper rate at something like 5 seconds per degree above 105°, which are all non-preferred turns.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Backup issue with free version,[],"We’ve discovered a bug specific to your application running on the Android P build. Please see the following details:

Application name: “Maps & GPS Navigation — OsmAnd(net.osmand)

Steps to reproduce the issue:

Install OsmAnd(free version which has a limit of 7 free maps) on a device and download one or more apps.
Initiate backup of your app by running “adb shell bmgr backupnow net.osmand”.

Setup a new device and select “Copy your data”.
Restore new device using old Android phone through cable or cloud storage.

Expected Result(s):
Everything, including app settings and downloaded maps are copied or neither is.


Observed Result(s):
Settings (including number of used map download slots) is copied, but downloaded maps are not copied. It implies user has fewer available download slots available because
user has to re-download maps that weren't copied, eating up duplicate slots.


Possible Root Cause(s): 
Auto backup is enabled and has a limit of 25 MB. The app should use backup & restore to remember that it has this map downloaded, and then download it again after restore.

I created a route between this pedestrian crossing (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4715104715) and this node (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3622807322), it can be on any mode.

### The result

As you can see here, OsmAnd says the route would take 2 minutes by car (and if you wanna try: 9 min by bicycle, and 7 min on foot) but the ferry route itself is 10 minutes.

Now the route details: tap on ""Distance/Time"" panel to see the route details.

Here I would expect something like "":ferry: 380 m / 0:10 | #. Take _Balsa Santos - Guarujá_ ferry"" between the direction 2 and 3. Perhaps the direction 2 should be split into 3 parts: ""Turn right and go"" (57 m), ""Take the {name} ferry"" (380 m) and ""Leave the ferry and head {highway name}"" (187 m). (Edit: it is also ignoring the highway name [""Avenida Ademar de Barros""](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/48452408) after leaving the ferry route)

Also using < > doesn't list the said ferry route. At least the distance is included in the direction 2 so the _Total distance_ is correct.

(In case you want another example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/203890192 the issue is the same.)

Some examples:

* import_gpx_file_description: was ""can be imported as Favorites, or as track file."", changed to ""can be imported as favorite, or track file."". The new phrase doesn't take into account that OsmAnd has a concept or feature called ""Favorites"", so when referring to that, an initial capital letter should be used, and that a track can have many waypoints, so it's more appropriate to use ""Favorites"" (plural).
* Several strings containing colons have been changed such that the initial letter of the word immediately following the colon is in uppercase. For example, osm_live_banner_desc now contains ""once a month: Weekly, daily, or hourly"". Capitalising the first letter in ""Weekly"" is not correct.
* Inconsistencies have been introduced, for example changing ""underlay"" (as in ""underlay map"" to ""underlaying""). The ""Configure map"" menu now is now inconsistent as it contains ""Overlay map"" and ""Underlaying map"".
* Typos have been introduced, for example ""doens\'t"" instead of ""doesn\'t"".
* ""Start time"" and ""End time"" (used in GPX analysis, for example) are now ""Departure"" and ""Arrival"" which makes little sense in this context.

issue: routing errors following loaded GPX-route
----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I WANT:
-----------
I bought OSMAND+ for road biking, getting nav instructions via a bluetooth headphone device.
(smartphone screen = off,  for saving battery time.)

>> my day trips are planned at home computer (-> stored as gpx-file: 1 trk, 1 trkseg with trkpt_s ).
>> normally the trip is a ""circuit"", start and end point are identical or lay side-by-side ( A---A ).
>> only for special situations (eg. unexpected road part closed for traffic) I have to leave the route temporary.
>> I want to use the OSMAND offline navigation, offline maps ( no_internet_conn )
>> requirement: the nav service should notice a route discrepancy, recalculate an alternativ track and 
   guide me from my current pos back onto my route


AND WHAT I HAVE:
----------------
In navigation profile 'bicycle' is 'OSMAND' as navigation service selected.
About navigation menu/ settings/ GPX-route, I've loaded my GPX-file.

Additional 3 options are given in this case:
opt_1: Reverse GPX direction (not used here)
opt_2: Pass along entire track 
opt_3: Calculate OsmAnd route for first and last route segment 
       (not used here, because I start/stop directly at my route begin/end )
 
opt_2= No
From beginning and as long as I'm on the GPX-route, the navigation guides me well along the GPX-route. but if I drift away from my route, automatically a recalculation occurs, which doesn't work accurately. OSMAND determinds a track point on my route to come back. but the new calculated track to touch my planned route again, doesn't follow real roads. It's only a straight line !!, which cuts the countryside or buildings.

opt_2= Yes
if I have selected ""Pass along entire track"" the result becomes still worse. The navigation seems to have no memory, that I'm just on the trip! if I drifted away from my route, the automatic recalculation builds again a straight line!! from my current pos backwards to the GPX-route starting point. This makes only sense on 1st calc with begin of navigation. Afterwards no more: if I drift away from my route, I should go back onto start position again ??? (nice game).

The calculation of time need are often wrong too. In the screenshots pic_3a/3b it seems to be okay: 7min plus time for the ""straight line"". but on larger routes I often got a message like e.g. ""distance 40 km, needs 2 minutes"".
 

Example screenshots:
pic_1:  a route 2,49 km in Germany, 81679 Munich, Bogenhausen; starting point at (Delpstrasse), ending point (Wehrlestrasse)
pic_2a/b: opt_2=no/ I'm parallel on (Soldnerweg), away from the GPX-route (Newtonstrasse). continously OSMAND recalc_s matches buildings all the time. here I get wrong speech information too (in 80 meter left) - not helpfull at my position.
pic_3a/b: opt_2=yes/ two different examples for OSMAND wrong recalc backward to the route starting point, although I'm already on the GPX-route


I hope, you can improve the OSMAND offline navigation:
- recalc a track on roads backward to GPX-route

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,First time route calculation peculiarities,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","We have old, separate issues for this, but let me consolidate under a new aspect, maybe it helps solving these:

Exactly, and only, after each app start, when you first start a route calculation, the following behavior occurs:
- No matter how long ago the app start happened, the beginning of the actual route calculation seems delayed, as if something is initializing then. This may not be very apparent on fast devices but, will easily cause a 15+ seconds or so pause on some mid grade or slower hardware. (We recently mitigate this by showing a 5% generic progress in the progress bar.)
- If (at the same time, or subsequently) the ""GO"" button is tapped, i.e. navigation is started in ""Follow"" mode, the big arrow widget (direction for the first segment/turn) in the top left corner of the map screen does display the distance ok, but the arrow itself is missing (until after the first turn is completed).

The 2 effects may be connected, not sure. What they definitely seem to have in common is that they (100% reproducibly) appear only for the first route calculation (respectively navigation) after each app start, after that they are reliably gone.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OSM modifications GPX export: exchange name and cmt,[],"Currently exporting OSM modifications as GPX file (osm_modification.gpx, osm_notes_modification.gpx), results in a XML structure similar to this one:

```
  <wpt lat=""47.2905881"" lon=""9.8544402"">
    <name>note create</name>
    <desc>id: -2</desc>

  <wpt lat=""47.2878724"" lon=""9.8488457"">
    <name>note create</name>
    <desc>id: -5</desc>
    <cmt>traffic lights</cmt>
  </wpt>
```

The `name` isn't very useful. The important information is stored in the `cmt` tag. I suggest to exchange these two tags to store the important information in the `name` tag in order to make the exported GPX files more useful for JOSM.

Here is why. Opening a GPX file with the current format in JOSM looks like this:
![josm_01_gpx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1040784/40805701-63c80998-651f-11e8-81a0-0f7856d7d059.png)
With the new format it would look like this:
![josm_02_gpx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1040784/40805707-68d7763a-651f-11e8-881e-f09c3f131dcf.png)

The difference with the new format here is that the important information is displayed first. This is a minor improvement.

However sometimes it make sense to convert the GPX layer into a data layer. This way you can copy the contents of tags in JOSM, e.g. a restaurant name. Converting a GPX file with the current format in JOSM looks like this:
![josm_01_data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1040784/40805803-bd322eb4-651f-11e8-81c7-7b210a938134.png)
With the new format it would look like this:
![josm_02_data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1040784/40805808-c3dd8402-651f-11e8-8ab2-7be289241138.png)

This is much more useful than just seeing generic ""note create"" objects.

So I suggest an option that switches the keyboard automatically to t9 mode, as soon as you enter the search dialogue. That would provide much bigger keys that are much easier to hit.

- **Color:** The progress bar now borders on the map, so it should have a color with good contrast vs. the map. I suggest instead of the generic light blue we could use the route color as defined by the rendering style? (Which is an intense dark blue for most cases)
- **Placement:** On some devices (maybe those with non-standard screen sizes, not sure) like the Samsung S4 Mini, the progress bar when attached to the route config dialog is not at the very top of the dialog but about 1.5 progress bar widths further down. Conversely, when the dialog is hidden, the progress bar is not at the very bottom of the map screen, but about 2 progress bar widths up from the bottom (with a small strip of the map being visible between the bar itself and the lower screen edge). Probably a rounding error of some sort when placing the bar? (Screenshot regarding this see https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/4149#issuecomment-392263621)


DONE:
- **Value:** We have always had this: when our normal 2 phase routing is active, the progress bar runs across the screen twice before the route is finished. Should not be a problem to predict when 2 phases will occur and simply adjust so that the end of the first phase is simply the 50% value (screen center), and the right hand screen edge is only reached after the second round (100% value)?
- **Initially no progress visible** for some time after route calculation starts: I have seen users stare at the route config dialog wondering if they need to still tap anything because the route calculation had not visibly started yet. (This e.g. can be due to the position still not found so the app waiting for that, or some initialization still going on, see e.g. #4043). This could maybe be solved by immediately starting the progress bar at its say 5% level (if a destination is already selected, not to be confused with if not, i.e. where the user really has to become active first), so the user clearly sees if OsmAnd is in the progress of calculating already, or if a user input is still needed?"

https://www.nominatim.org/data/gb_postcode_data.sql.gz
It is a compressed 33mb file containing every used postcode in the UK. On each line there are three sets of data (id, postocde, geometry). This is an example:

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Border Patrol announcement at crossing,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","After adding the barrier ""Border Control"" tags, and getting the newest obf in time for another crossing this week, 
Yesterday after stopping at that location and turning off my vehicle to talk to the officer, OsmAnd choose a bad time to say ""Attention Border Patrol"" interrupting and covering the other person speaking.

I would think announcing it just as a rail road crossing is correct, when I am approaching it, but not after already doing so once, and NOT when I am already stopped.

After posting this issue at Google groups, I've determined this is a bug.

On the way northbound, I had Routing (Directions) active, Routing by car, it made the first announcement when approaching the border station at 48.999148 -118.504092
I forget if it announced a second time, but once I moved forward to speak with Canadian officers, it was silent.

On the way southbound, I did not have Routing active, so it was in World mode, just displaying so I could monitor my position and speed limits visually. I know GPS was locked on with good reception, because other apps in the background were recording data points again.

Playing back my dash cam, I can report the sequence of events.
16:41:54 49.000386 -118.503712 it made the first announcement ""Attention Border Patrol""

How to reproduce:

Route from lat 50.59577, lon 8.67692 (Egerländer Straße (Nordstadt), Gießen) to lat 50.59462, lon 8.67633 (Asterweg, Gießen) between 08:00-19:00.

Observe that it won't route the obvious direct path, but rather routes a long indirection. I haven't tried this outside that time yet but if the same happens there it is correct behavior on these times.

The direct route has a node `barrier=bollard`, `bollard=rising`, `opening_hours=08:00-19:00` (opening_hours should probably only be interpreted with a rising bollard and not with general barriers https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bollard)

Going from top right on this screenshot to bottom left, circle is bollard: ![https://wfr.moe/f15iEz.png](https://wfr.moe/f15iEz.png)

I don't know if this happens because my map is too old? The change to this bollard is around a week old and I don't know another one to test. The Interface doesn't show any details of the bollard at all when clicking it, editing it does not seem possible using the edit plugin either."

However, this is very problematic since I live in a town, and not a big city so most houses do not have house numbers and ip addresses attached to them. This means that many postcodes are missing unlesss you use online search (thankfully osmand has this, maps.me doesn't and it is a deal breaker).

Pedestrian routing chooses to cross the main road although there's a saver, preferable underpass designated for pedestrians and bicycles in OSM, which is no detour at all.
Sometimes, especially on the first routing attempt, pedestrian routing chooses the same path as bicycle routing, but after switching directions or changing start point or destination pedestrian routing is switching to the main road. Bicycle routing works perfect though.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Issues using bluetooth GPS unit on non-GPS equipped device,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I've ordered Amazon Fire HD 10 without checking whether it has GPS/GLONAS built in, so I ordered the Garmin Glo. My friends and I often times go to the mountains, so it is useful to have a nice GPS unit with you anyway. I've ran into issues using navigation or any orientation using OsmAnd+ in my car via the external GPS.

I tried to figure out how to use the Garmin Glo with OsmAnd+, but felt like the only way is via software like the Bluetooth GPS. I have filled #4932 since as I think OsmAnd could benefit by supporting bluetooth GPS units.

My setup:

- [Amazon Fire HD 10 (7th Generation)](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Fire-HD-10-Inch-Tablet-32GB-Black/dp/B01J6RPGKG), Android 5
- [Garmin Glo](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/109827)
- [Bluetooth GPS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=googoo.android.btgps)
- OsmAnd+ 2.9.3, released 2018-02-08, installed from the Google Play store

OsmAnd settings:
- navigation profile set to car
- snap to road: enabled

The problem:

Whenever navigating the pointer that shows where I am on the map would go out of order. It would display my position incorrectly, altho the GPS unit seems to have it correct. OsmAnd seem to have the correct positioning data, because I have enabled showing a trace log and the red line shows it fine. Seems like there's some weird algorithm that would screw things up.

Note that the problem persists even if navigation is not engaged. I often times use the map to have an idea of the curves of the road or the street direction.

Please, have a look at the screenshots below. The current speed is shown, the navigation line is shown as well as the thin red line that shows the trace.

![screenshot_2018-02-18-19-29-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11616/40230762-7a36466e-5aa1-11e8-9a39-1b0a7e3d3b7c.png)
Here you can see I'm already in the roundabout, while the pointer is shown before it. Any navigation directions like ""enter the roundabout"" are obsolete at this point. The only relevant one would be which exit to take. The map is partially rendered, Fire HD's processor is not that powerful and stutters from time to time. Maybe the map was rotating at the time of taking the screenshot. You can see my girlfriend pressed the media buttons by mistake while trying to take the screenshot.

![screenshot_2018-02-18-19-30-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11616/40230906-eedaa2f8-5aa1-11e8-944e-d2aba6096106.png)
Another roundabout, another miss. You can see the red trail and how much the pointer is lagging behind.

As mentioned, this happens when the navigation is not engaged as well. Here's an example. Red trail is ahead of the pointer.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Wikivoyage: Some UI related issues,[],"(1) Open a Travel article, tap on ""Points"", then tap on any point of interest. The desired behavior is that the point tab disappears and the map screen appears, centered on the tapped point. Instead, the Wikivoyage article screen appears again (map is hidden behind it). To worsen things, the article's top-left ""Back"" arrow is now non-functional, leaving that screen now only works via the device's ""Back"" button.

(2) Unrelated, but similar topic: Some articles do not contain points, but this can only be found out by tapping on the Points button and reaching an empty points screen. For articles not containing points it  would be better we gray out the Points button form the start?

(3) Every time an article's Points button is tapped, its corresponding GPX file is added to the list of GPX files currently visible on the map (without users being immediately aware of it). I guess we should add the possibility to remove it again by showing a top bar with an (x) button at the top of the map screen, similar to how we do it when e.g. displaying a bus route (after tapping one on a bus stop's context menu)?

(4) When surfing Travel articles while being online (e.g. via Wi-Fi), a significant amount of cached image data may collect. I guess we should
   (a) introduce a maximum limit and upon reaching it delete the oldest pictures again (revolving deletion)
   (b) display the current size of the image cache (number of MB) somewhere, e.g. in the ""Clear image cache"" line of the Travel settings?

(5) For the sake of power saving, it would make sense to turn off GPS while users are viewing Wiki articles, as it is not needed during that (potentially extensive) time period."

**OsmAnd+ 2.9.3 from 2018-02-08 on Android 7.0**

The auto-complete list of POI searchbar is too much sensitive, specially with accented characters (é È ï î). For instance in French, if you type `gite` instead of `gîte`, the latest won't show up. 

This is specially bad on mobile where you skip accented characters  on purpose due to poor accessibility. 

It would be great if either:

- OsmAnd could compare user input and presets by converting them to ASCII first (with possible losses which would not matter I believe) : `gîte` --> `gite`, `hôtel` -> `hotel`, etc.. 
- (better but harder) Instead of simply using `userInput.equals(presetName)`, a more evolved matching algorithm (similarly to iD, sublime text…) could rely on [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) or [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching), so that the system gets tolerant with mobile users. Eg `restorent` would still match `restaurant` and I think it would be OK.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,No priority to street name of destination when deciding endpoint of route,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I experienced a peculiarity when navigating recently using OsmAnd~ 2.9.3 from F-Droid.

Position: *56.26853, 8.15805*
Destination: *56.2685870, 8.1580210* ([OSM address node](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/966771512))
Destination address (OsmAnd style): *""81, Bækbyvej, Vedersø Klit, Husby, Holstebro Kommune, Region Midtjylland, 6990, Danmark""*
Destination address (traditional Danish convention): *""Bækbyvej 81, 6990 Ulfborg, Danmark"")*

In this situation OsmAnd, even though the position is very close to the destination, chooses an endpoint which is on a road with a different name, [""Vestre Mosevej""](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/144965681), than the destination road, [""Bækbyvej""](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27712588) (my guess is because it is slightly closer). This results in a route of ~2km. by car to a location from which the address is not reachable; a ditch is blocking on the map (and in reality also a row of trees).
The residential segments of the way seems to be appropriately tagged in both in the current OSM and the maps on the device (not visible on screenshots below, but I have verified).

Seems like the destination address' name should somehow be prioritised when deciding endpoint of route."

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Problems with maps,[],"Because I don't want to post the topic twice, below in German.

Hello, I hope I'm right here in the forum. 
I have a problem with OsmAnd.
I have tested it and think that this problem is related to the individual maps (further explanations below).

If I select a street on the map, for example in Lampertheim, the wrong city (Ludwigshafen or Worms) is always displayed, but I have not found any errors in OSM.
I am using OsmAnd+ 2.9.3 with the Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate (rlp) map from April 1, 2018 (and also tested with new maps from May 1).
Strangely, the problem does not occur if I have only installed the map of Hesse and not the map of Rhineland-Palatinate. And if I have no map at all (or only the overview map) installed and then click there, then is displayed, download map of Rhineland-Palatinate, although it is actually located in the state Hesse.

I think that's the problem.
If I have only installed the map of Rhineland-Palatinate (rlp), then a small piece of Hesse is still included, and the names are therefore wrong.
And sometimes big roads just disappear when you zoom, because some roads/data are not included in the right maps.
The Rhineland-Palatinate map partly contains data from Hesse, but the Hesse map sometimes also contains this data.
And sometimes the Hesse map does not contain any data, although it should actually contain them.

Pictures should clarify the problems.
1: Here you can see the overlay at both borders.
2: Rhineland-Palatinate is on the western side of the Rhine (it is also correctly mapped in OSM). However, you can also see some data from Hesse (e.g. Lampertheim).
3: Only the Rhineland-Palatinate map is installed here and then the town Ludwigshafen is displayed for streets in Lampertheim.
4.5: Or Worms
6,7: If you have only installed the overview map and click on the street in Lampertheim, you should download the map of Rhineland-Palatinate. (Although Lampertheim is in Hesse.)
8: If you have only installed the Hesse map, the location is displayed correctly as Lampertheim.
9,10: If both the Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate maps are now installed, then the location is displayed incorrectly again (because OsmAnd uses the rlp map here??).

For this problem (pictures 11-15) I found the mistake. It is not displayed because this area belongs to Baden-Würtemberg and not to Hesse. :man_facepalming: Pardon me, my mistake.
However, the other bugs still exist, I haven't found any errors in my thinking yet.

> 11,12: Here the overview, Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate maps are installed again, if you zoom, then the B44 and A6 disappear.
> 13,14,15: This is probably because these roads are not included in the Hesse/RLP map, but only in the overview map.

Thanks for all the helpful answers.

EDIT: Problem 2 (images 11 to 15) fixed

---German---
Hallo, ich hoffe ich bin hier richtig im Forum.
Ich habe ein Problem mit OsmAnd.
Ich habe es ausgetestet und denke, dass dieses Problem mit den einzelnen Karten zusammenhängt (unten weitere Erklärungen).

Wenn ich auf der Karte eine Straße bspw. im Ort Lampertheim auswähle, wird immer die falsche Stadt (Ludwigshafen oder Worms) angezeigt, ich habe allerdings in OSM keinen Fehler gefunden.
Ich benutze OsmAnd+ 2.9.3 mit der Hessen- und Rheinland-Pfalz (rlp)-Karte vom 1. April 2018 (auch getestet mit neusten Karten vom 1. Mai).
Komischerweise tritt das Problem nicht auf, wenn ich nur die Karte von Hessen und nicht die Karte von Rheinland-Pfalz installiert habe. Und wenn ich überhaupt keine Karte (bzw. nur die Übersichtskarte) installiert habe und dann dort klicke, dann wird angezeigt, Karte von Rheinland-Pfalz herunterladen, obwohl es eigentlich in Hessen liegt.

Ich denke nun, genau das ist das Problem.
Wenn ich nur die Karte von Rheinland-Pfalz (rlp) installiert habe, dann wird mir ein kleines Stück von Hessen noch mit angezeigt, und die Namen sind deshalb falsch.
Und manchmal verschwinden große Straßen einfach, wenn man zoomt, weil manche Straße/Daten nicht in den richtigen Karten enthalten sind.
Die Rheinland-Pfalz-Karte enthält teilweise Daten von Hessen, allerdings enthält die Hessen-Karte manchmal auch diese Daten.
Und manchmal enthält die Hessen-Karte keine Daten, obwohl es diese eigentlich enthalten müsste.

Bilder sollen die Probleme verdeutlichen.
1: Hier kann man an beiden Grenzen die Überlagerung sehen.
2: Rheinland-Pfalz liegt auf der westlichen Rheinseite (es ist auch richtig in OSM gemappt). Allerdings kann man hier teilweise auch Daten aus Hessen sehen (bspw. Lampertheim).
3: Hier ist nur die Rheinland-Pfalz-Karte installiert und dann wird bei Straßen in Lampertheim der Ort Ludwigshafen angezeigt.
4,5: Oder Worms
6,7: Wenn man nun nur die Übersichtskarte installiert hat und auf die Straße in Lampertheim klickt, soll man die Karte von Rheinland-Pfalz herunterladen. (Obwohl Lampertheim in Hessen liegt.)
8: Wenn man nur die Hessen-Karte installiert hat, wird der Ort richtig als Lampertheim angezeigt.
9,10: Wenn nun allerdings die Hessen- und Rheinland-Pfalz-Karte beide installiert sind, dann wird der Ort wieder falsch angezeigt (weil OsmAnd hier auf die Rlp-Karte zurückgreift?).

Für dieses Problem (Bilder 11-15) habe ich den Fehler gefunden. Es wird nicht angezeigt, da dieser Bereich zu Baden-Würtemberg und nicht zu Hessen gehört. :man_facepalming: Entschuldigung, mein Fehler.
Die anderen Fehler bestehen allerdings weiterhin, hier habe ich noch keinen Denkfehler meinerseits gefunden. 
> 11,12: Hier sind wieder die Übersichts-, Hessen- und Rheinland-Pfalz-Karte installiert, wenn man jetzt zoomt, dann verschwinden die B44 und A6.
> 13,14,15: Das liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass diese Straßen nicht in der Hessen-/RLP-Karte enthalten sind, sondern nur in der Übersichtskarte.


Danke für alle hilfreichen Antworten.


EDIT: Problem 2 (Bilder 11 bis 15) korrigiert

I guess that you mean [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), but guessing can be pretty risky when it comes to legal stuff. If that is the license you're referred to, which version are you using? Is it 4.0, the latest version, or an earlier version? If it is an earlier version, is it the ""unported version"", or a country-specific version? Whichever version it was licensed under, do you trust CC enough as stewards of those licenses to add an ""or later"" to that?

If not asking to be pedantic. Obviously, each license has very different legal implications for how people can and can't use your work, but the different versions of the licenses have different legal implications too. The difference between 4.0 and earlier versions is major, since that upgrade dropped the country-specific ""ports"", and drafted one set of CC licenses that apply worldwide. IANAL but I use 4.0 for my own CC-licensed work to make sure that I'm free and clear of all that country-specific stuff, and that I benefit from all the clarification of what clauses like NC, ND, and SA mean in practice.

BTW I guess I'm not the first to note that a [non-free CC license](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/LICENSE) seems an odd choice for the UI of a program whose code is a licensed under either GPL (equivalent to CC BY-SA) and or a non-copyleft license (equivalent to CC-BY).

- OsmAnd has Location and Storage permission
- disabling Android's Power saving and ticking ""Device Administrator"" for OsmAnd makes no difference

Looks like the problem only exists for recording intervals >= 30 sec, i.e. where we turn off GPS between recording points. So the issue may be a problem with the execution of the background task in sleep mode or turning on the GPS in sleep mode. Not sure if related or identical with #4274.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Feature Request: Improve support for lane tagging on motorway exits,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I think the behaviour of voice and lane instructions at junctions could be improved.
Currently, if the driver needs to use a motorway exit, osmand gives the distance to the point ""highway:motorway_junction"".
In most cases (more about later) this is the point where a deceleration lane ENDS (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lane_assist/Examples/Motorway_exit).
This information is not that useful for a driver. He needs to know (preferably by voice) when to switch lanes and for safety reasons, as early as possible so at the BEGINNING of that lane.

Sadly, the lanes and turn:lanes tagging is not available everywhere. In France for example, the point of ""highway:motorway_junction"" is set to the beginning of a deceleration lane (In this case the voice guidance works well).

Suggestion 1:
Osmand should support both ways of mapping:

Search for the point motorway_junction
a.) if there is no lane tagging on the segment before let osmand act as it is now doing. (Voice guidance: ""Turn slight right"")
b.) the segment before has a turn:lane tagging: ""Go back"" to the point where the additional lane is added and use it to calculate the distance. (Voice guidance: ""In x meter use (right|left) exit lane to destination)

I fully agree thats not easy to programmatically catch different ways of mapping styles, but in this case i think it would improve a lot.
Due to the different voice output an experienced mapper could find places where the tagging is missing and add it later based on sat pictures.
Instructions would be more clear on places where 2 exits are very close to each other (https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/3788).
Instructions would be more consistent because in both cases the driver would get the distance to the point where the exit lane starts.

Suggestion 2:
Support destination:lanes
This tag seems to be ignored by osmand but could be quite useful in cases where an exit lane splits in multiple ways with different destinations.
Espescially with voice guidance this will allow the driver to choose the correct lane without looking at the display."

I've re-checked the tags on the involved ways and relations multiple times, so for now I assume it's all correctly tagged. Please let me know if you find that the issue is with the tagging and not with how OsmAnd interprets it.

To reproduce the problem, try navigating from 

https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/578082587
to
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/119331431

and simulate position using the developer plugin (btw, any chance to get an easy for this directly where you specify the from and to positions when starting navigation?)

Two issues, first, minor one:

This is how the lanes are tagged (image in JOSM using lane and road attribute map style)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/38534373-50a827f2-3cc1-11e8-9594-7cb62910a3f4.png)

Here is the lane guidance when approaching.
![screenshot_20180410-131124](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/38534406-71418738-3cc1-11e8-9e23-9bc07ed50ab2.png)

It's almost correct, but it would be much better if only the left-most lane was recommended at this point. I assume the recommendation for the two left lanes comes from the next step:

![screenshot_20180410-131136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/38534486-d53aaaee-3cc1-11e8-8944-d674cc3e2d9e.png)

Which is correct. But there seems to be the assumption that the two leftmost lanes from the previous guidance flow directly into these two turn lanes. Which is not correct. The two turn lanes are both new lanes added on the left, and you should really already be only in the leftmost lane when approaching. (As can be seen in the screenshot in JOSM).

There are tags in place that explicitly specify how the lanes connect to each other between different way segments.

First the way where it's still 3 lanes:

https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/578076526
the most relevant tag is:

transit:lanes=new_on_left|continue|continue

which specifies that from this to the next way, a new way is added on the left, and the 3 lanes continue (the ""new_on_left"" is documented shorthand for ""new_on_left;continue""), resulting in 4 lanes in the next way segment.

This is the next way segment:

https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/578076528

we are up to 4 lanes now, and the turn lanes are tagged:

lanes=4
turn:lanes=left|through|through|through

There is again a transit tag to describe the relation to the next way segment:

transit:lanes=new_on_left|continue|continue|continue

which specifies that from this to the next way, a again new way is added on the left, and the 4 lanes continue (the ""new_on_left"" is again shorthand for ""new_on_left;continue""), resulting in 5 lanes in the next way segment.

And finally the next segment:

https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/578076529

we are up to 5 lanes now, and the turn lanes are tagged:

lanes=5
turn:lanes=left|left|through|through|through

no transit tag on this as the following way segment has the identical 5 lanes, so all lanes connect 1:1:

https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/578119966

This is the way at which end the way that cuts the corner of the intersection splits off.

As this is a split it can't be unambiguously described by a tag on the way, so there are two relations of type=transit with this way as their ""from"" member:

https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/8193612 describes the lane connections for the part that forks off (""to"" member is the first way segment of the way that cuts the corner):

through_route=no
transit:lanes=continue|continue|leave|leave|leave

which indicates that the two leftmost lanes continue into this way (so the ""to"" way has 2 lanes) and the 3 remaining lanes go ""somewhere else"".

https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/8193611 describes the lane connections for the part that continues along Anzac Av (the ""to"" member is the next way segment along Anzac Av):

through_route=yes
leave|leave|new_on_left|continue|continue

which indicate that the two leftmost lanes go somewhere else (so contribute 0 lanes), a new lane is added on the left (the begin of the bike lane there) and the three lanes on the right continue (the ""new_on_left"" is again shorthand for ""new_on_left;continue""), resulting in 4 lanes (3 of which are for motorized traffic, reflected in the lanes=3, and one is a bike lane, defined by cycleway=lane).

By following these lane changes, it's clear that to turn, you need to be in the two leftmost lanes at the moment of the turn, and that both of these lanes are new lanes that were added on the left compared to the 3 original lanes. So to be able to change into one of the turn lanes, you would already need to be in the leftmost lane before they are being added.

Second issue, and this one is more major (but the detailed description of the transit tag above should help with fixing this):

If you continue into North Lakes Drive, you see this:

![screenshot_20180410-130524](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/38535215-d55f1128-3cc5-11e8-8ff9-46b330261aac.png)

The leftmost through arrow here is actually for the bike lane (I reported that previously in #5126 ) and can be ignored.

But then it indicates that the through lane would be the preferred lane, when I really need to be in one of the two right turn lanes to make that turn into Memorial Drive.

Here is how it looks in JOSM:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/38535439-ca78631c-3cc6-11e8-89e0-4b1a17037796.png)

I'm not going to point them all out again, but there are once more detailed transit:lanes tags and type=transit relations that exactly specify how the lanes are connected, and if you follow these along the route, it becomes clear that the only way to turn into Memorial drive is to be in one of the two turn lanes.

Beyond just fixing this issue, if you want to be really good, in the previous step:

![screenshot_20180410-131136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/38534486-d53aaaee-3cc1-11e8-8944-d674cc3e2d9e.png)

You could have two levels of lane guidance (using different shades for the arrows), first, all the lanes that you must be in to make that turn (which is correct with the two left turn lanes), but second, which of these lanes would be preferred (which is only the right of these two lanes, because following the defined lane transitions, that one means that you end up in the correct right turn lane to get on Memorial Drive without any further lane changes).

Similar, when you approach the turn into Memorial Drive, it should show both right turn lanes in the guidance, but should show preference for the right one (because the left one ends up in a lane that directly has to merge to the right where Memorial drive goes down from two to one lane)."

Osmand latest nightly on differtn Android versions
Since some time Charging Stations are not shown any more.
When I try to
Search->Categories->Custom Search/Service/Charging station
or
......./Transportation/ Charging station
there is ""Nothing found within the radius:  xx km""

But there is at least one included in in OSM.
When I zoom to this place Configure map->POI overlay-> Nearest POI
I can see it as an orange circle without an icon in it (once it was a gas station with a plug).
Opening it shows (beside other data) ""Osmand electricity combined charging""
(It is an AC-only station, no CCS)

The main problem is, that I make my own obf-files from POI-files (.gpx) from here:
https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/poi/
gpx-files are converted by GPSBabel to .osm, then to obf by OsmAndMapCreator, latest available version.X
In osm-file a POI looks like this:

<node id='-3' visible='true' lat='51.3161810' lon='9.4596310'>
    <tag k='created_by' v='GPSBabel-1.5.2'/>

    <tag k='note' v='Stadthalle in 34119 Kassel - Friedrich-Ebert-Straße 160, 1 x Typ 2 22 kW, 1 x Typ 2 11 kW, 2 x Schuko, andere, Parkplätze 2, Je nach Anbieter und Tarif'/>
    <tag k='amenity' v='charging_station'/>
  </node>

And these files worked until some time ago.
I use German as language in Osmand and had to filter for Tansport/Ladestation (in Englisch: Transportation/Charging station)and all the stations where shown in the map.

There must have been done some changes, wherever i don't know, but seems have to do with the bold formates text above.

So a lot of questions:
What should stand in the tag above instead of ""amenity"" and ""charging_station""
What category and type must I set in filter.
Where can i find a list of POI-names and corresponding icons?

What must somebody else do, to make this work again?

The bicycle lanes are ""designated"", access for vehicles is prohibited (in two different ways, the ""access:lanes:forward=bicycle|yes"" should already exclude everything except bicycles, but the ""vehicle:lanes:forward=no|yes"" makes it explicit), and the width of the bicycle lane is only 1.5m.

Here is what it looks like in JOSM with the ""Lane and road attribute"" map style active:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/37381719-63b046d2-278a-11e8-930b-35adc2d1326b.png)

And finally, here is what the lane guidance looks like OsmAnd (using OsmAnd Live data for offline-navigation):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27037648/37381395-ac4bf0dc-2788-11e8-927c-6ca4c934bb92.png)

As you can see the lane guidance shows that there are 2 lanes going in the driving direction, without giving any indication that one of these ""lanes"" is actually the bicycle lane.

This is very confusing.

When in ""Car"" navigation mode,  pure bicycle lanes tagged like this should either not show at all, or the lane guidance arrow should be overlaid with a bicycle symbol."
osmandapp/Osmand,open,"""Landmark algorithm"" for OsmAnd",[],"It should be investigated if ""landmark algorithm"" can be implemented in OsmAnd to replace the current routing engine in order to improve performance.

GraphHopper has introduced a new algorithm they call ""landmark algorithm"" since release 0.9.0.

While being faster than Dijkstra and A-Star, ""landmark algorithm"" offers the following advantages compared to the even faster contraction hierarchies:

""Note that GraphHopper is able to change the cost function used to calculate the best path on the fly, e.g. you can change the shortest or fastest path per request. This cost function is called the “weighting” internally which is independent of the calculation used for the time of the route.""

""The newly developed landmark algorithm is an algorithm using A* with a new heuristic based on landmarks and the triangle inequality for the goal direction. Note that despite using this heuristic the algorithm still returns optimal routes. Also, this algorithm was developed earlier than CH so only “new” in GraphHopper.""

""Here it is important to highlight the limitation of this algorithm compared to the flexible mode: without recalculating the landmark weight tables we can only increase an edge weight. If we would do a decrease the resulting routes could be suboptimal. But for most scenarios this works nicely (traffic jams make your weights higher) or you can invert the requirement to make the rest slower.""

Without world base map (which is not available by default) the user cannot navigate to required territory. And with base map downloaded the user need to go to the territory, put a marker there and press download in no-address-determined pop-up. 

Too many actions. And moreover, world base map is counted in free limit.

I think OsmAnd really needs a mapsme-like behaviour in this scenario. 

1.  World base map should be downloaded by default (and it **must** not be counted in free limit).
2. The application should give a direct prompt for downloading a region map when user navigates (searchs) to required region and zooms it to some level. "

Osmand planned the route via low quality road, where we are theoretically allowed to go 90km/h, but practically it is not possible to do more than 50km/h. This particular road is 3m wide, not maintained in winter, and currently under solid layer of ice running through a dark forest. An unforgettable driving experience.

## Proposal

Let Osmand prefer roads of higher class and use only first and second class roads (yellow and orange on the linked map), then use the third class roads only to achieve the destination.

Use of the better roads would result in much faster long-distance routing since it would have to consider much smaller number of roads. Also, driving experience would be much better."

The instructions given, though, say to turn right at the junction (onto 346593128), then immediately left (onto 346593127), then immediately right again (onto 492835187).

All the OSM map data seems to be reasonable.  The straight on ways 391333230 - 95468789 - 492835187 all have maxspeed=40mph, but 346593128 and 346593127 have no maxspeed.  There are no turn restriction relations at the junction.

Is it possible that the routing decides that taking the detour is better than following 95468789 because they have a higher (by default) speed limit?  This may be so, but for such a short stretch of faster road the turn penalties should count for more.

I have edited OSM to add maxspeed=40mph on 346593128 and 346593127, and also added an only_straight_on restriction where they cross.  I will check this issue again when the OsmAnd+ maps have been updated.

This feature should be as simple as normal applications do in a normal computer, as .gpx files can be used too. Useful to migrate from device to device, and to prepare 1 device and propagate customized Osmand profile to other devices.

+A particular situation today:
I'm currently using Osmand 2.8.2 from F-Droid.
I have whole device backups. I had a problem with new application installed, and no other solution than restoring a full device backup (system&data). Before doing this restoration I could backup broken system too.
Then: Last good backup has half of my Osmand favourites, and broken-system backup has a lot of favourites more. I explored backup folders and files but didn't find Osmand saved data. How can I replace current working profile with those complete files from Osman ""old"" data?"

In any case it would be better if Osmand got addresses directly from tags of OSM (if they exist). Addresses could be shown on POI'S description (like phone) including postcode.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Fast computing way back ? (imply : keep computed routes in history or save somewhere),"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi,

When I'm traveling far away, needing the GPS, there is a high probability that I'll need to get back home afterward.

I think that, maybe, computing a way back, reversing a way forth (and recomputing the few one-way portions) could be faster than recomputing all the long way. Ouais !

It's rare that I'm going somewhere to immediately go back. So in order to be useful, this return-home functionality should be paired with a ""keep route in history"" feature. Maybe just ""keep long routes"". Or keep the last long route.

The current threshold of 20km to decide if a route is recalculated or just ""reached again"" seems to fit perfectly.

If a way of saving routes is implemented, one way or one other, then we may be allowed to pre-compute routes between two bookmarked places and save it someway. This would allow to compute a route before going to bed the day before a long trip, and have the route ready to go in early morning the day after (when minutes before the 1st direction are important)."

**Extract :**
« By favoring right-hand turns at all times -- unless a left is unavoidable -- the carrier saves millions of gallons of fuel each year, and avoids emissions equivalent to over 20,000 passenger cars. »

**Key points :**
- Left-hand turns are generally considered unsafe and wasteful on right-hand driving roads, such as those in the US and most of the EU ;
- Left-turning traffic typically has to turn against a flow of oncoming vehicles ;
- This can not only be dangerous, but makes traffic build up, unless you install a dedicated left-turn 'phase,' which is fine but basically adds 30 or 45 seconds to everyone else's single time ;
- A study on crash factors in intersection-related accidents shows that turning left is one of the leading ""critical pre-crash events"" ;
- Left turns are also three times more likely to kill pedestrians than right ones.

I use the hillshade layer quite often. Beside the noticable issue in rendering these hillshade data (#2183) it is very handy in getting an overview about a region with many valles.

All the routes are tagged with the network tag of ""US:I:Business:Loop"" or ""US:I:Business:Spur"" in the relations, and you could use the same 'Interstate' type shield for both without any problems (as long as it's green of course).

It would be great to see the proper shields for them if possible.  I've also attached an example of how it currently looks with the latest map data for Pennsylvania for the route mentioned above.

that would allow other mapper to see/understand the problem more easily (a lot of tools diplay fixme tag) and help to fix it.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Handling of route calculation to intermediate destinations,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Yesterday, I was driving home from a private visit. I had some 200 kms to go and route calculation (I would have found it on my own, but it feels better) took about one minute. Well, we are used to OsmAnd not being the fastest offline router at all.

A few seconds after I started, I realised I needed refueling. So I picked a nearby filling station and set that as ""first intermediate destination"". That caused the ENTIRE route calculation to start over, taking another minute or so – while I was already on my way, and just a few kms off my first destination! 

Having lost my patience, and before missing the station because the calculation would take longer than my way there, I cancelled the routing and requested a route to the filling station as final destination, which came up after 4 seconds – just in time to turn at the next junction! 

My question: When an intermediate destination is added while already in routing directions mode, why not calculate the first leg to the new sub-destination first AND display it asap – and then, while the user is already following that direction, calculate the rest in the background? That way, closer sub-destinations would come up much quicker, and users wouldn’t have to wait a few minutes unnecessarily for a few-miles-drive to their first destination just because the route after that is considerably longer.

Not sure what has triggered the menu on, it could have been vibration or a droplet of water on the screen.

Perhaps OsmAnd could detect the user is moving at speed and block non-essential UI functions. Or have a driving mode with a similar functionality.

The ""through"" lanes appear to be shown twice, with no exit lane guidance.  Prior to my edit, the exit lanes were displayed as the usual ""invented lanes"" that OsmAnd displays for lane guidance when there are no turn:lanes directives.  I suppose that the problem could also be that OsmAnd is showing the 4 through lanes, plus its 2 ""invented"" lanes, plus the 2 lanes indicated by my turn:lanes edit.

- 16098 results with `XX bis`, `XX Bis` or `XX BIS`
- 1621 results with `XXbis`, `XXBis` or `XXBIS`

It looks like the search engine in OsmAnd handles all those cases (to be checked).

**The issue:** I suggest during the creation of the map files on OsmAnd side to clean those tags by applying only one syntaxe. This would:

1. Make maps more professional thanks to a common syntaxe
2. Simplify the use of the search engine (the search engine is a complexe piece of software... having standardized syntaxe helps simplifying algorithms and detecting issues). Personnaly when OsmAnd don't find the answer I try with or without space, with or whithout upper case... because i've seen that those addresses are not standardized on the map.
3. Maybe reduce a little bit the map size depending on how data compression is made

Which syntaxe to choose? The better would be be to have a per-map rule which would detect which format is the more used for a given map to generate (maybe countries have different rules). Otherwise if a unique rule has to be devised:

- For bis, ter... I suggest to use the most popular one which is `XX bis` (lower case with a space).
- For A, B... I suggest to use the most popular one which is by far `XXa` (lower case no space).

What version of OsmAnd are you using, on what device and Android/iOS version?
Osmand version: 2.82
Android version: 7.1 LineageOS

I have the following issue. Example: Finding a certain store.

I want to find a store called ""Coop Mega"" in an area called Bekkestua in Oslo.

1) Type ""coop Bekkestua"" into the search. 
2) Some of the first types of results that pop up are ""Address"" results, with the magnifying glass icon next to them. The first of those is actually precisely the address for the store I want (Coop Extra Bekkestua, 35, Gamle Ringeriksvei, Bekkestua, Bærum, Akershus, 1357, Norway).
3) I tap on that search result before waiting for the other results to populate, since that's the thing I'm interested in and I want to go there.
4) I get presented with ""Nothing found :("" and I'm confused, since I just found exactly what I was looking for but it's not taking me to the map view centered on my search result, ready to press the navigate button. 

Now, in the end I figured out that in that ""Nothing found"" window I can still tap on ""Show COOP EXTRA...."" and it will bring me to the map view, centered on that address. However, that button is tiny and easily missable and since I was told ""Nothing found"", my first thought was just to assume that something had gone wrong. Instead, it seems the ""Address"" search results are somehow different. If I had waited a bit longer for the results to populate, I would actually have gotten the a POI search result for exactly that store instead of an ""Address"". Tapping on that gets me directly to the map. 

I've had this apparent problem of Osmand finding addresses but ""still not finding them"" for a while and just assumed that it was a problem of Osmand not being able to interpret the address returned by Nominatim (if that's where it comes from?). I never thought it was actually working as intended.

So I humbly propose this: When tapping on an address, that's where I want to go on the map, so instead of showing my ""Nothing found"", just take me there. 

Otherwise I'd be interested in the rational behind the current behaviour. Attached is a screenshot of the ""Nothing found"" search result screen that I find confusing.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Idea: Bluetooth GPS support,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Recently I've got an Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet, which I planned to use for in-car navigation. I felt mislead when I found out that it actually lacks GPS module. I tried using [Tether GPS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanandbrenda.gpstether) and use my phone sensor, but some delays are ruining the experience with OsmAnd+.

A few days back I've got a brand new [Garmin Glo](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/109827) - GPS sensor that pairs using Bluetooth. Android and OsmAnd in particular can't seem to be able to use this device directly. Instead, one has to enable Developer options and use the Mock location functionality to intentionally lie to the device about the current location. Then install a 3rd party application that would connect to the Bluetooth GPS sensor, fetch data from it and mock the location of the device, effectively working like a proxy between the two.

IMO the mock location functionality is one that should mostly be used by developers - that's why its under `Developer options` - options that are intended for developers, not for the regular users to make their navigation app work. That said, using Mock location feels like a hack to me. Yes, it works, but it's a hack and should be avoided whenever possible.

I can see [this question](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/DjrpzKn_jHk) was posted back in 2013 in the Google groups, but never got a satisfying answer. It's 2018 now.

What do you say to have Bluetooth GPS client built-in into OsmAnd?

Multiple benefits come to mind:
- Users won't have to hack their way using 3rd party applications.
- Depending on the device, OsmAnd may utilise the extra data. For example, the Garmin Glo that I bought supplies 10 location updates per second. Contrast that with 1 update per second or two for the regular smart phone or tablet.

PS It was a bit of a let down to realise iOS can utilise Bluetooth GPS sensors way better than Android does.

PS2 Some may argue this is an Android specific feature. While this may sound true, how about the benefits of the extra data we can get? We can use those, no matter what OS the device uses as long as we support Bluetooth GPS sensors."

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Save recorded tracks to correct month directories,[],"(Fixes the other part of #4895 not fixed in de4d697)

When a setting is enabled, OsmAnd saves recorded tracks to monthly directories. For example, all tracks recorded in January 2018 are saved to a directory named 2018-01, tracks recorded in February 2018 are saved to 2018-02, and so on.

Previously, the UTC time of the first track point was to determine the monthly directory to use, but the local time of the first track point was used to determine the track filename.

This meant that if OsmAnd was running on a device with a time zone ahead of UTC, at the start of a month, a track could be saved in the previous month's directory, but with the new month in the filename, causing confusion.

For example, suppose OsmAnd is running on a phone whose time zone is set to UTC+0300. A user starts recording a track at 0100 local time on 1st January 2018. When the user saves the track, OsmAnd uses the UTC time of the track's first point, which is 0100 local but 2200 UTC on the previous day, so the track is incorrectly placed in the 2017-12 directory. The track filename is based on local time, so it is correct, but it's confusing to have a 2018-01... track in the 2017-12 directory."

""This plugin for OsmAnd puts at your fingertips details of global downhill 
ski slopes, cross country ski runs, Alpine ski routes, cable cars and ski 
lifts. Routes and pistes are shown color-coded by difficulty, and depicted 
in a special 'Winter' map style which assimilates a snow-colored winter 
landscape. \n

Activating this view changes the map style to 'Winter and ski', showing all 
landscape features under wintry conditions. This view can be reverted by 
either de-activating it again here, or by changing the 'Map style' under 
'Configure map' as desired.""

I can see 'Winter and ski' as a map style in the Android app, but nowhere I can find any similar occurrence in the translation files. I'd guess it's not properly marked for translation, right?

I am searching for the exact 'Winter and ski' which is used as a translation for the

The use of passive voice (""will be""), and past tense (""opened""), just doesn't sound right.  A better way to word it would be ""Will open at....""

addr:city, addr:postcode, addr:street and addr:housenumber are set but only ""Avenue Emile Zola"" (which is the street) is displayed in OsmAnd. I would expect to have the full address displayed quickly (i.e. no need for the searching address mechanism) as soon as it is already embedded in the POI.

No addr: fields but the address found in OsmAnd is ""Rue des Quatre Frères Peignot (15e arrondissement), Paris"" which corresponds to the street, the suburb (between brackets) and the city. Surprisingly this one is more detailed than the previous one despite it has no addr: tags.

I'm using OsmAnd+ 2.8.2 published on 2017-10-20 with Live update option

**Nota:**
Ideally, an address displayed in most of the countries (order can change) is made of at least:

- a house number (by priority: addr:housenumber of the POI, of an enclosing feature or the closest one?)
- a street name (by priority: addr:street of the POI, of an enclosing feature or the closest one? must match the house number found)
- a postcode/zip code (by priority: addr:postcode of the POI or of an enclosing feature)
- a city (by priority: addr:city of the POI or of an enclosing feature)

This line calculates the angle difference between two route segments for calculating a turn penalty. The value of `diff` is:

`diff` value | meaning 
----- | -------
zero | no turn at all
small, and positive | a small turn, either left or right
pi/2 | 90° turn, either left or right
a little less than pi | nearly 180° uturn, either left or right

`diff` then gets compared to two thresholds: 2/3 pi and 1/2 pi, to split the turn into three bands, which I will describe as a severe u-turn, hard turn, or barely a turn at all.

""barely a turn"" has zero penalty.

""severe u-turn"" and ""hard turn"" have penalties determined by the methods `getLeftTurn` and `getRightTurn`, which correspond to the ""leftturn"" and ""rightturn"" attributes in `routing.xml. 

As implemented, ""leftturn"" is the penalty for a severe u-turn of more than 2/3 pi (120°) **in either direction left or right**. ""rightturn"" is the penalty for a hard turn between 90° and 120° **in either direction left or right**.

Unless I'm missing something, the `routing.xml` attribute names and method names are highly misleading.

What Android version? 6.0.1 (SlimRom)

Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps? offline

Reproduce: 100%
 1. OsmAnd Hang / Force quit -> reopens with ""World"": 100%
 2. Phone reboot  -> reopens with ""World"": 100%

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Osmand manipulates a manually specified Data storage path,[],"As an extension of Issue #3288, even in 2.8.3, we still have the following issue, not sure if it is still worth fixing:

When on an Android version <4.4 and in OsmAnd General settings you go to 'Data storage folder' and you manually specify the **Android 4.4+ convention** `(ext storage)/Android/data/net.osmand(.plus)/files` (some people do this to be able to swap SD cards between different devices with Android 4.4 and lower versions), OsmAnd automatically adds an extra `/osmand` to the end of the data folder path (making the path now `(ext storage)/Android/data/net.osmand(.plus)/files/osmand`), and thus manipulates the path a user manually specified. The user cannot avoid this, and it breaks the interoperability of OsmAnd SD cards in different devices even if the Data storage path in OsmAnd is manually set correctly."
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Where is the file which contains search history for street addresses?,[],"So OsmAnd worked absolutely perfectly on my device with offline maps for about a year until about three weeks ago I noticed in F-droid there was an update several versions newer which I thought I would install. It really (was) a wonderful app. Man if it ain't broken don't fix it.. I wish I knew the old version number that was on it before I might go back and install it if all else fails, maybe it is in the F-Droid log. Am probably too scared to ever update it again..

Anyway, so I noticed [this](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/3288) issue, a nesting of osmand directories. Here is a [link to the file with the directory tree.](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/1594903/directory_tree_osmand.txt) I made a backup of that on the PC with Rsync, intend to completely remove all osmand directories from the phone and fresh install the latest version of the app and hopefully it will recreate the directories afresh as they should be. 

Two things were lost:
1. The offline maps I downloaded - this is replaceable, it's only a question of bandwidth. Anyway, it might be possible to simply copy the .obf file into the new directory on the phone from the PC. 
2. The search history for street addresses. 

I notice a file `favourites.gpx` with an xml like content with a few of my favourites. But I almost never used the favourites function - all the important addresses were basically within the search history.

So the main question - it's a big directory tree, does anyone know which file contains the search history and if it can simply be copied into a new directory?

Any general tips about the situation also welcome.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Contributing speed limits to OSM,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi,

I noticed Osmand is using OSM speed limits and can be configured to show them on screen while navigating. However (at least near my place), there a lots of roads without any street limit set in OSM.

Waze is also doing a similar thing, displaying the speed limit. But contrary to Osmand (as far as I know), when there is no data there is a nice UI to submit new speed limits. This is super useful and could be used to contribute while driving (for the passenger use, of course). As Osmand is quite widely used as a routing app, I guess it could help put speed limits in OSM quite easily.

I know about [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete) which is offering a nice UI as well for setting speed limits, although it is not super convenient to use while driving, and would require a switch of apps.

What do you think about it?

Thanks for all the work you are putting in Osmand!"

First, thanks for maintaining and working on this app - I use it on a regular basis and am very happy with it overall!

The issue I am having is with the directions button - both when appearing on the map, and when appearing after looking up an address. It appears to be linked to ""location permission"", in that it will not work unless I allow OSMand to use my location. When location permission denied, pressing the button doesn't open the dialogue with the two directions search fields. I am doing a work around where I directly go on a pin of an address->more actions->directions from, but would like to have the possibility of just naturally opening directions search without allowing the location permission. Not sure whether ""location being a natural requirement for OSMand"" means that it is really best to have it allowed, though...so correct me if I'm pushing in the wrong direction :).  Thanks!

- Kill/start the app fresh. Wait until while the map is rendered, or shortly after the map rendering is complete
- Hit the ""Directions"" button on the map (near the lower left corner)

OsmAnd will crash, no exception log is created

- Looks like if you wait long enough after the map finishes rendering, the very same destination produces no error any more, i.e. route starts being calculated. Can be checked by repeatedly starting the app over.

- I think hitting the directions key may only be one way to reproduce the crash. I have a feeling just panning to another obf region immediately after app start also produces the crash. Could be that we have an issue with OsmAnd trying to access a second obf file too early during app initialization causes issues?

Observed by several different users experiencing this during app startup on different devices. Quite a frequent bug if users start OsmAnd to quickly check the route to  pre-selected destination, or accidentally hit the directions key at the ""wrong time"" during startup. But I have not yet seen this occur if the pre-selected destination was on the same obf file, or closer than 250 km.

On an about-475 mile trip home yesterday, the referenced nightly build misbehaved in several ways.  This issue relates to wrong-way routing on oneway roads.  This appears to be the same problem that I described in #4629 but is very reproduceable now.

A simple example that reproduces this behavior uses the same start/destination points as my Avoid Motorways issue:

Start location:  https://osm.org/go/ZQqtvUzJX?way=288866558 (Bubbles Car Wash)

Destination:  https://osm.org/go/ZQq8zxfvb?m=&way=288866558 (a traffic signal at an intersection)

On an about 475 mile trip home yesterday, of which the normal, best route is about 470 miles of Interstate 75, the referenced nightly build misbehaved in several ways.  This issue relates to motorway routing.

Despite having Avoid Motorways deselected, OsmAnd persisted in trying to route me along numerous stretches of non-Interestate roads.  (The trip away from home on Dec. 1 using the previous-referenced night build properly routed me along the Interstate the entire way.)  It was not a complete avoidance of I 75, but numerous stretches did try to take surface roads.  Interestingly enough, *selecting* Avoid Motorways *did* try to route me along the freeway.

I am able to reproduce this odd behavior of routing on the freeway when Avoid Motorways is selected by using the following:

Start location:  https://osm.org/go/ZQqtvUzJX?way=288866558 (Bubbles Car Wash)

Destination:  https://osm.org/go/ZQq8zxfvb?m=&way=288866558 (a traffic signal at an intersection)

Be sure that all route modifers are deselected except for Avoid Motorways, which should be enabled.


Tell us your expected routing, and how OsmAnd routes, or add screenshots here.

With Avoid Motorways selected, OsmAnd should not route me up I 75, yet you can see in the screenshot that it does.  Deselecting Avoid Motorways doesn't seem to change the routing for this short trip.  (On my longer trip it did change things, as I mentioned in the ""Please specify exactly..."" paragraph.  Later when I have enough time, I'll try to add additional information, start/destination points, waypoints, etc., from the trip.)

I see on the taginfo page you support only `fee=yes/no` values: https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/?key=fee#projects

Is feasible to accept `fee=<interval>` values?

I don't know how you could render the icon, perhaps with a little clock icon if it doesn't clutter the interface too much. Or perhaps showing just the dollar sign on the map and saying in the menu:
* ""Fee: pay fee for (HH:MM) hours"" (if the time is within the range)
* ""Fee: free until (when you have to pay again)"" (if outside the range)
* ""Fee: always"" (if 24/7)
All followed by the time range like the `opening_hours` tag.

Another solution (easier?) could be render it as if it had `fee=yes` and then in the properties menu show the time range like the `opening_hours` tag.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Verify Search concept,[],"When looking at other apps which perform search operations in huge indexes (i.e. scientific libraries or dictionaries) I find that they are still **instantaneous** in suggesting search results even while you type, while the performance of our offline text search seems **much** inferior with us looking the a spinner and an empty list of search hits for a long time.

I suggest we take a second look at our search mechanism and figure out why this is, and if it can be improved. I am currently not sure where we lose all that time, is it actually finding the hits in the index (that should be rather quick if it is sorted correctly?), or is it sorting them by distance (maybe that should be done later, after already suggesting/displaying them?), or is it a some sub-optimum search algorithm trying to unnecessarily scan the index by successively increasing the search radius, rather than just doing a much quicker total list lookup?"

In the new 2.8.2 version there is an export option for notes. The user can choose the notes that he want to export and an option to produce a GPX with a waypoint for each note selected to be exported. 
First, thanks for that it is really usefull and better than the previous method (waypoint on a track).
Just some improvement to be perfect tool : 
- Add an option to export a GPX with all note position (not only the selected notes). (when there is too much notes there is no way to export them because there is a freez). 
- Add in the GPX the note type (audio, video, photo) and the length in a cmt or desc section.

 - (A2) If the search was already finished before the user added the new character, the search must not even be re-started, as the list of search hits is simply the above filtered sub-list of the already existing search hits (for the given search radius).

**(B)** User deletes a character from the end of the search text (by tapping the backspace key)

But IMHO this issue is not related to these factors.

The problem is this: If the map orientation is set to ""Compass"", OsmAnd turns the map correctly to match with surrounding streets and buildings. But if we are moving fast (as in a vehicle, not when walking rapidly-) the map does not show the correct orientation.

I suspect that the algorithm forces some sort of correction: 

- In one case, the map seemed to switch to ""North"" (OsmAnd shows the compass icon, but with its red tip pointing up). 
- In other case, the speed vector seemed to change the bearing (a higher speed may result in more deviation)."

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Calculated route quirks,[],"Hi,

I wanted to share some small issues on computed roads.

Using : OsmAnd 2.7.5
Map of France : 1 novembre 2017 

**First example Amailloux / La Couaillère**

On D19, from Amailloux to La Couaillère (south of Clessé, https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/147247#map=15/46.7030/-0.4045) the navigation tels me to pass through the ""city center"" of Clessé, instead of the no-name route in front of the D46.

If I, nonetheless go through this last road, the re-calculation of the route is ok to go this way, and find that it's a few minutes shorter.

_May be an ongoing optimizer re-routing calculation may have find this short hand ?_

Could be linked to : https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/3755


**Another example Amailloux / Thouars**

From Amailloux to Thouars, at the D938 / D170 crossroad, instead of sticking on the main 2x2 way road, the computed route tels to quit and use a small side road, for 1km or so before getting back to the main road. Here also, sticking on the main road is recognized as quicker when re-calculation occurs. (I also see that the 2 roads have the same name/number…).

https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/147247#map=15/46.8482/-0.2089

It's worth noting that at the return time, the error is not made. So computing for both directions may help smoothening the route.

Like for the out-in at D938 / D162 crossroad from north to south… OSMand tells me to out the road and immediately turn back in, as if I was to use the entrance way while I'm already in. Here:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/147247#map=14/47.0404/-0.1979


**Another example Noyen-sur-Sarthe**

From Sablé-sur-Sarthe to Mezeray.

At Parcé-sur-Sarthe, OsmAnd invite to take the D8 to pass through Malicorne. But I continue via the D309 toward Noyen-sur-Sarthe.

At Noyen-sur-Sarthe, OsmAnd invite me to turn on the right via the D41 to go back to Malicorne.
I continue on the D309.

200m away, OsmAnd have recalculated the way, throught D309. The new route is now 5 minute shorter than the 1st one, through Malicorne.

_Here, being able to trigger a full route calculation instead of letting OsmAnd trying to get me back to the 1st track would help._"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,ascent aware hiking time (#4804),[],
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,User Story: Terrain (Ascent) Aware Hiking Time,[],"As a spin-off of Issue #4455, the idea is for pedestrian based profiles to factor any ascent into the 'travel time needed' estimate. Naismith's rule of adding 1 hour of walking time per every 600 m of ascent is a well accepted lower limit for the actual walking time required in hilly terrain.

Basic idea is to use the `heightDistanceArray` for every `RouteDataObject` to calculate the ascent (or any remaining ascent) on the segment, then apply Naismith's rule to add an ascent penalty to `getLeftTime` in `RouteCalculationResult`. To be investigated if this can be done with simple methods  or needs CPU intensive GPX analysis code each time (`analysis.diffElevationUp`).

Then, as per Zahnstocher: The only change needed for routing engine is a change of routing.xml, just change `obstacle_srtm_alt_speed` section of pedestrian to:

```
  <way attribute=""obstacle_srtm_alt_speed"">
  	<if param=""height_obstacles"">
  		<gt value1=""0"" value2="":incline"">
  			<select value=""0""/>
  		</gt>
  		<select value=""6""/>
  	</if>
  </way>
```
Now you get 6 seconds penalty per ascent meter (= Naismith, 1h per 600m). Inclines smaller 1% are filtered out.

I am using osmand 2.8 (from f-droit repo), with the offline maps.

In Paris (France), I can see that the metro line are displayed in colour, for instance 
the [Metro, line 12](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/123775#map=13/48.8654/2.3195&layers=D)

However, the bus and tramway lines are displayed only in red, for instance in Nantes the
[Tramway line 2 ](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/64032) or the [Bus Line 96](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1710610)

All these 3 relations have the colour attribute.

It is possible to print the bus and tramway lines with their colour, instead of everything in red ?

Kind regards,

Currently,  I have very slow Mapillary response - through their app and web as well. 

In Osmand, the problem shows only if I don't have Mapillary tiles cached. In such case, switching the Mapillary info on completely stops the on-screen displaying of the map - only the empty solid background is shown. The map will show on zooming out to the zooms,  where Mapillary stops displaying.
Switching the Mapillary layer off, the map works as usually.

Note: The debbugging rendering info shows the usuall response with the usual speed, no slow down there. However,  no map is shown.

Happens both in Osmand free from store as in latest beta.

Suggestion: watch for Mapillary response time, and on slow, disable it, perhaps with message to user. Alternatively,  simply note it as possible negative effect. "

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Cannot clear names of bus stops,[],"I'm trying to edit bus stops that have a bus stop number in their `name=*` instead of `ref=*´. Adding the `ref` tag works but it seems like cannot clear the `name` tag.

I cleared all stop numbers (from the `name` tag) in the following change set, however, they are still there:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/53827376

To confirm this I created another change set to remove the name of only one bus stop:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/53827607

### Setup:
- OSMAnd~ 2.7.5 for Android from the F-Droid store.
- Unofficial LinageOS 14.1 build for marmite (Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus); Android 7.1.2
- I use the Standard off-line map of British Columbia with OSM Live updates from today. (2017-11-16T03:27:00Z)

### Reproduce:
1. Start editing a bus stop.
2. Select the name of the stop and 'Cut' it (not sure if using cut is important).
3. Click Save
4. Upload the Changed POI to OpenStreetMap.

I had the suspicion that this was happening over the last couple of days before confirming it today. This might be a fairly fresh regression."
osmandapp/Osmand,open,small distance precision,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","In voice prompts, small distances up to 100m or 100 yards get rounded to multiples of 10 meters or yards.

The instruction ""turn left, then in 10 meters turn right"" can be misleading due this rounding. This particularly affects pedestrian voice guidance, where there can be several footpath turnings within 10 meters.

Ive been using a modified profile that uses 1m rounding for distances less than 18 meters. This is better, and no disadvantages observed so far.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,open,Auto-zoom at slow speeds,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","In many cases auto-zoom works very well:
1. It zooms out to show a large distance at high speeds
2. It zooms closer at low speeds, which makes it easier to find tight turns.
3. It zooms closer still at very slow speeds. Close enough to show house numbers on the screen if you are slow enough to read numbers off the houses out the window

All good, however I find there are cases where the closer zoom is inappropriate:

a. When moving at slow speeds on a motorway or trunk road, it is a safe assumption that I am not looking for a tight turn or reading house numbers, so zooming in is counterproductive. When on those road types, would it be better to autozoom based on road maximum speed, rather than actual speed?

b. When stationary it stays at the close zoom, the same as when moving at slow speeds. Being stationary is not the same as going extremely slow, because it means you are not actually driving. After being stationary for a few seconds does it make sense to zoom out again?"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Bug: Excessive transliteration of default names,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","When we choose the language of the map, there is an option to transliterate names is there is no name in specified language. I noticed then when I turn this option on for Russian language and I browse the map of Russia I see that 90% of Russian names became transliterated. I noticed that the chances to be transliterated are almost 100% for local objects (small streets, shops) and less for some prominent objects (rivers, towns). That led me to guess that the app transliterate ""default"" names (the names that don't have language tag in OSM database), even if actual language of the name is Russian. I assume that this is very widespread situation around the world, not only in Russia: most local names in OSM don't have language tag. To address this issue I suggest this algorithm:

IF we have ""default"" name (name that doesn't have language tag in OSM database)
THEN 
1) skip characters that belong to either chosen language alphabet or English alphabet 
2) transliterate other characters

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Feature suggestion: Show direction only to top marker,[],"Right now the app shows directions to top two markers in the list. I should say that this behavior distract me as a user. I put my markers into some order and at any given moment of time I go or ride to only one point – the top one. When I see two arrows,  I need to do mental efforts every time to distinguish between the one I am going right now and some another that I will need only later – this is rather annoying. So I suggest to show direction to only one top marker, OR if there are some users that have explained why they need two directions simultaneously, then please add option ""Show direction to one / two markers"".

I have tried to interpret these notes ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/osmand/J0lcnZN0fLU/OT-4gQs_BwAJ ) however it appears the versions of JDK and SDK versions referenced are now obsolete and unavailable.

Is there a more up to date guide on setting up the development environment ?

So far by substituting JDK 8 (7 is no longer available) and using the default SDK version that is installed with Studio I can get a successful gradle build from the command line, allthough I do also see warnings about refusing to generate code for  .aidl files.

Is this even a reasonable setup ?
Should I expect these warnings ?

The .apk installs and runs but fails to render offline maps if I zoom out beyond 1km.
Any ideas what might be the cause ?

I am building r2.8 on a clean install ubuntu 16.04 host, I have tried with both open JDK and Oracle, both yield the same results.

Until this date, a lot of bus stop numbers can be found in the tags 
name=* and name:en=*. Often the bus stop number is only a substring and sometimes the values differ from each other.

In a local OSM meetup, it has been discussed that our bus stop numbers 
should be correctly mapped in ref=*. This will make it easier for 
applications to parse the bus stop number. Sadly, OSMAnd~ only shows 
ref=* if no name=* has been set. I ask you to make the ref tag more 
prominent, e.g.:

* Show it underneath the orange bus icon when clicking on the bus stop, 
* Include it in the list of details and/or 
* Make it part of the name as done with shops which include their 
house number in brackets.

In each scenario first zoom out to a low zoom level.

1- Long-tap on the map to put a place indicator pin or tap on a place to put an indicator.

Using plus button, zoom in to that place. Then begin to move the map around, to see places in its neighborhood for example.

You'll see that the map suddenly jumps somewhere and you lose your focus from the point you were looking at (bad, issue 1).

2- This time put an indicator and don&apos;t use the zoom button, but tap on the poped-up menu to see some additional information, for example. By doing this app will also zoom in to that place.

Now move the map around and this time we won&apos;t lose our focus (good)

3- If we zoom in to a place with 1st method and then tap on the poped-up menu, app will do an unneeded step to find the point I was just seeing (bad, issue 2). Now by moving the map around there isn&apos;t such a problem.

2,1M	x86.zip

ie, we could reduce, in average, the APK size by ~6M if we distribute it specifically to the supported architectures.

Another thing that could reduce it a little more:
`res` has 84M (85308KB) (compacted is 27M)
If we optimize the PNG files we could have it down to 83M (84012KB) (compacted as 23M)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Misinterpretation of maxweight in offline routing,[],"Hi,

apparently, OsmAnd+ 2.8.2 offline navigation (car mode) gets confused with a maxweight=* tag on an OSM way and a vehicle weight specified within the navigation settings.

See this routing task: https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=mapzen_car&route=50.2128%2C8.2483%3B50.1978%2C8.2446#map=15/50.2053/8.2461

Both K707 and K708, giving the shortest and fastest route, have a maxweight=3.5. 

As long as I don’t specify a vehicle weight in Osmand’s navigation settings, the short route via the K roads is suggested.

As soon as I specify a vehicle weight of 1.5 tons and re-request a route, those roads are avoided, though the weight given is well within limit! 

I consider this a bug, maybe a kilograms vs. tons conflict in processing those values.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Crash and other wrong behaviour when GPS signal come back after lost,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","OSMand 2.7.5 crashed when I drive out a tunnel.

Since the last updating of  Android 7 on a Huawei P8 lite 2017 smartphone (EMUI build PRA-LX1C109B131), OSMand has now a strange behaviour. When the GPS signal come back, the position of the cursor is shifted at between 0.5 to one km or until 5 km from the right position. After a while (15 min), the position error is still between 0.5 to two km. So OSMand is unusable at this moment.

To fix this behaviour, I must close Osmand. 

My maps are the last official France offline maps from Osmand with some live maps.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Handle Geo URI parameters,[],"On Android, when I click on an address from a calendar entry it proposes me to open it with a map application. I choose OsmAnd+ but it look like the app is not able to recognize parameters such as in this Geo URI: `geo:?q=Paris` whereas `Paris` works fine.

This is quite anoying when you want to use OsmAnd+ as your main map application.

On the other hand OsmAnd+ is able to handle Geo URIs with coordinates (which is very handy).

Since Android pushes for the use of parameters and major other applications handle them (Google Maps, CityMapper...) it would be a good step for OsmAnd+ to handle parameters (at least `q`). Here is a page listing schemes (=intents) used for map location/search by Android: https://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents.html:

- `geo:latitude,longitude`
- `geo:latitude,longitude?z=zoom`
- `geo:0,0?q=my+street+address`
- `geo:0,0?q=business+near+city`

Also, I've observed other schemes that are recognized by Google maps, CityMapper... and which should also be handled:

- [Percent encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) instead of `+`: `geo:0,0?q=value%20separated%20by%20space`

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Replace prebuilt jar files with Maven dependencies,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I have been working on adding the new version of OsmAnd to the F-Droid repository.  A problem here is that F-Droid does not accept prebuilt binaries.  Our discussion can be followed [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/issues/959).

One hopefully easy to fix issue is the number of libraries distributed with OsmAnd that could be replaced by Maven dependencies.  The purpose of this post is to ask: 

- would OsmAnd be willing to accept a patch/pull request to replace these dependencies?
- are our chosen replacements for version mismatches benign?

We have been able to remove all jar files and still compile OsmAnd with the following replacements.  Our simple testing seems to show no problems.  I will list the replacements in full before discussing mismatches.

In OsmAnd/build.gradle, the fileTree dependencies can be replaced with
```
compile 'commons-logging:commons-logging-api:1.1'
compile 'it.unibo.alice.tuprolog:tuprolog:3.2.1'
compile 'org.beanshell:bsh-core:2.0b4'

compile 'org.immutables:gson:2.5.0'
compile 'com.vividsolutions:jts-core:1.14.0'
```

In OsmAnd-java/build.gradle, the dependencies can be replaced with
```
compile 'commons-logging:commons-logging:1.1.1'
compile 'net.sf.trove4j:trove4j:3.0.3'
compile 'org.json:json:20090211'
compile 'it.unibo.alice.tuprolog:tuprolog:3.2.1'
compile 'net.sf.kxml:kxml2:2.3.0'
compile 'org.beanshell:bsh-core:2.0b4'
compile 'com.ibm.icu:icu4j:50.1'
compile 'fr.univ-valenciennes:bzip2:1.0'
compile 'com.moparisthebest:junidecode:0.1.1'
compile 'com.vividsolutions:jts-core:1.14.0'
```

There are the following mismatches:

-  gnu-trove-osmand.jar replaced with net.sf.trove4j:trove4j:3.0.3. What is gnu-trove-osmand?  If it is a bespoke version of GNU Trove, where can the source be found?
-  tuprolog.jar replaced with it.unibo.alice.tuprolog:tuprolog:3.2.1.  Which version of tuprolog is used by OsmAnd?
- icu4j-49_1_patched.jar replaced with compile 'com.ibm.icu:icu4j:50.1' in the hope that whatever patch was applied appears also in 50.1.  What patch has been applied (and is the source available)?
- bzip2-20090327.jar replaced with compile 'fr.univ-valenciennes:bzip2:1.0'.  Here i took the latest version available on Maven: i did not see one close to a 2009 release date.
- junidecode-0.1.jar replaced with compile 'com.moparisthebest:junidecode:0.1.1'.  There is a .1 version difference.
- simple-logging.jar not replaced in OsmAnd-java (it was not needed).  It was replaced by commons-logging:commons-logging-api:1.1 in OsmAnd.  I could not find any sources for simple-logging.jar, but its contents are similar to commons-logging-api.  The main difference is that the provided Log class requires a few more abstract methods to be implemented.  I added the following code to OsmandLogImplementation in PlatformUtil.java:
```
public void trace(Object message) { }
public void trace(Object message, Throwable t) { }
public boolean isTraceEnabled() { return false; }
```

I have seen a [similar issue](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/2460) raised before.  However, hopefully this request is simpler, and i'm volunteering to make the patch.

By blank map I mean that I have all the information around the screen and even the route to follow when navigation is active, but no map details, no roads, no green areas. Here and there, in the middle of the blank map, it draws something that I think are pedestrian tunnels. Basically I have a blank map showing unconnected pedestrian tunnels only.

- He can show the photo to locals to get better directions (e.g. which bus route to take to reach there).

Now I would like to suppress the ""Voice:"" notifications, so I have turned ""Sound: off"" in OSMAnd navigation settings for pedestrian, speech engine to ""not used"", switched the phone loudness down, set the phone to silent mode.

I tried some other online gpx viewers, and they seem to be more tolerant, i.e. they displayed the track without errors. So I think this issue is quite rare (you need to be at sea level with an elevation measurement very close to 0, and open the gpx track in a program that does strict format checks).

Related tagging, described in the [Openstreetmap wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made=cross), is *natural=peak + summit:cross=yes* on the same node. Its usage is progressively increasing. A less used tagging is *natural=peak + man_made=cross* on the same node.

Excellent [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/#map=15/45.95473/10.06142) online map already renders it with a small cross on top of the *peak* symbol. Most classic paper-made hiking maps show it.

When rebooting or force-closing the app, suddenly more storage is available again.
This makes updating a large number of maps a very tedious process of downloading some updates, force-closing the app and repeating.
The behaviour suggests that after an update the old version of the maps are still around and open.
I do not know which code handles updates, but it needs to make sure to not clean out all references to the old map data, and in addition it must ensure to explicitly close all file handles (or, as a hackish and strongly not recommended method, forcing a gc pass might help)."

Reason: 
The Android/data folder has .nomedia settings and this is inherited for subfolders and this means the default Osmand folder as well. The recorded tracks and notes (photos etc.) cannot be seen from PC when using MTP connection.
There are workarounds, but the question comes in forum repeatedly. 
Easiest solution would be probably a dedicated folder outside of the Android/data folder, asking the user once if he/she wants to set this folder when enabling the module and/or giving the possibility in the settings."

I found that AsyncTask.execute is used in many places in OsmAnd (like in [ReportsFragment.java](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/564a8662b3899d008635c0c8cad8a21f454399e7/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/liveupdates/ReportsFragment.java), [AvailableGPXFragment.java](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/a2e513285f1a88c38844e314082ff71d3da24742/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/myplaces/AvailableGPXFragment.java), some methods starts more than one AsyncTask). The behaviour of this API has changed since API 11 and from there, tasks started by this API will be executed on the same thread. Replacing it with `executeOnExecutor` may improve the performance by running the tasks in real multiple threads.

By the way, I also found `executeOnExecutor` is already in use at some places. At some places, there's an API-level check before invoking the API (like [here](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/ba04890f443f9e8c533b9b3c8d001e815d5b6f74/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/GeocodingLookupService.java#L121)). However, this is no longer needed as the minSDK is 14 (I read this info from OsmAnd build.gradle, if the minSDK is not read from the environment variable) If you suppose minSDK could be lower than 11, some call sites of `executeOnExecutor` may crash like [here](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/d687b02eadd39bb07e814ba1430c53d124460f4b/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/liveupdates/OsmLiveActivity.java#L71).

In recent times (I guess since OsmAnd 2.7.5) OsmAnd started to send turning instructions to the android notification system and the Jolla phone displays those on top of the OsmAnd window. See the blue rectangle in this screenshot:

This system notifications do contain only redundant information, which can already be seen on the OsmAnd window. So they are not helpful. They are even bad, since these notifications cover other data of the OsmAnd window like distance to destination or the name of the road I am driving on.

So I would like to disable them for my use case. But at the moment Jolla does not provide an option to disable notifications for individual android apps.

Therefore I am asking you, to please add an option to OsmAnd to disable the sending of those android notifications on turning instructions. Thanks.

Preface:  OsmAnd was reporting fast-route generation errors and other error messages.  

I started here: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/375026096

I tried to put an intermediate waypoint on GA 20, but OsmAnd started throwing fast-route calculation errors and other errors at me, so I finally just removed it.  It might be because the marker wasn't *quite* on GA 20.

After removing that waypoint, OsmAnd finally did calculate a route.  However, I intentionally ignored OsmAnd's directions because I wanted to drive around the west side of Cartersville, Georgia, to get some GPS traces of new road construction.  (This is why I tried to place a waypoint, so it would direct me that way.)

After circumnavigating Cartersville, I got on I 75 here:  https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/440065111

OsmAnd kept trying to direct me off of the interstate and route me to my destination via non-motorways, even though staying on the Interstate was the fastest (and in the past, it has directed me that way).

When I got to Wade Green Road, I got off the freeway intentionally (at this junction https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/67552359 ) in order to get GPS traces of the new road configuration there (which I'll started editing into OSM soon).  I went south on Wade Green Road, turned around just south of the freeway area, and went north, then turned around at the pharmacy just north of the freeway and went south again, so I could get back on the freeway and resume my journey.  During this last southbound part is when OsmAnd directed me to go down the freeway exit ramp the wrong way, and onto the northbound lanes of I 75 to go south!

Here's the exit ramp it wanted me to drive down:  https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/437893460

Because I had to stop at a traffic signal, I was able to get screenshots showing the routing.  I'm uploading them full-size so you can see the details better.  If you want smaller versions, let me know.

I will note that this is not the first time OsmAnd has tried to direct me to drive the wrong way on a one-way road; this just happens to be the first time that I was stopped and able to get screenshots, and to be sure exactly where I was when it happened.  (The previous times were returning from Blue Ridge, Georgia, driving down GA 515, and at various places where there were turn lanes, it would try to tell me to turn left then right to drive south on the northbound lanes.  It's just that at 65 mph, I can't really take screenshots, and wasn't able to make notes about where it happened.)  So the problem isn't limited to this night build; it goes back a few months.  It is very rare, however.

I would prefer not to post my destination for privacy reasons, but I can e-mail it to you if you want.  (Although, I suspect that the exact destination might not matter for this....)

I've read #2841 and I also have a similar opinion and I think that there are some problems with right to left display in OsmAnd. But I think it needs more clarifications.
So I tried to describe this issue with some comparable screenshots of current LTR and RTL layouts.

The second picture in each pair is in Persian.
Because of legibility I only put links.

**- EXAMPLE 1 [Dashboard]**
As you see in screenshots below
[dashboard_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31745526-f0215afe-b46f-11e7-8c42-b56d3f3402b6.png)  **VS** [dashboard_fa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31745527-f0634aea-b46f-11e7-94e8-41900011b1aa.png)
in LTR layout title of each card is placed at left and its button (text in blue) is at right side.
Now compare this with RTL layout.
In RTL, titles are pushed to the right but those blue buttons are still where they were.

Also below the title, there is card content which in LTR layout we have this order of items in a row:
Navigation arrow icon → a brief description → play and stop buttons.
Now again compare this with RTL layout.
In RTL, at begining we have play and stop buttons, then a brief description, and finally navigation arrow, which should be reversed because it is seen from right to left.

**- EXAMPLE 2 [Menu → Configure map]**
Like first example, in LTR layout we have item icon → description of item → [... (options button)] → toggle button.
But in RTL we have toggle button → [... (options button)] → description of item → item icon.
[configure_map_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31744220-dbfc6960-b46a-11e7-84ad-9b1e3435dbdb.png) **VS** [configure_map_fa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31744418-87522c78-b46b-11e7-929f-45f3e20d304b.png)

**- EXAMPLE 3 [Menu → Map markers → Options]**
Notice at ""distance indicator"" row when display view is RTL, it sounds unsettled.
[map_markers_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31744756-fb71e0ac-b46c-11e7-916b-74741076c19e.png) **VS** [map_markers_fa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31744758-fd860936-b46c-11e7-94b0-325064e80f92.png)

**- EXAMPLE 4 [Mapillary plugin]**
Here I would like you notice at ""Dates"" item.
In LTR, we start with ""From"" and then ""To"". Sounds natural.
But in RTL and with current layout we first will see ""To"" field and then ""From"" which doesn't sound good.
[mapillary_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31744884-911d1298-b46d-11e7-9572-0923e3301c65.png) **VS** [mapillary_fa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31744885-91593fe8-b46d-11e7-8ad7-bb792089fde5.png)

**- EXAMPLE 5 [Settings → Navigation settings]**
Here, all are LTR except description of three first items.
[settings_navigation_en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31745316-1378eb58-b46f-11e7-8861-229a12c49a73.png) **VS** [settings_navigation_fa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8467903/31745317-13b4662e-b46f-11e7-9fdd-3514e7f3db37.png)

These examples are some samples of this issue that there is widely on other parts of the app, when we choose a RTL language like Persian, Arabic, etc.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,less greedy intent-filter for www.openstreetmap.org (fixes #4440),[],"# Issue
OsmAnd currently offers to open any www.openstreetmap.org URL. This is incorrect, as OsmAnd can only make use of URLs that reference a geo point.

Also, registering an intent filter for all of openstreetmap breaks the OAuth process for other Android apps, trying to access www.openstreetmap.org/oauth. See #4440 for details.

# Solution
In [GeoPointParserUtil.java#L932ff](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd-java/src/net/osmand/util/GeoPointParserUtil.java#L932) I identified the following schemes which OsmAnd can parse a geo point from the URL (click for example URL):
[www.openstreetmap.org/#map=...](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/50.06644/19.93515&layers=C)

[www.openstreetmap.org/go/...](http://openstreetmap.org/go/0LQ127-?m)

All the three paths are now explicitly specified in the intent-filter. I.e., with this change, OsmAnd will not offer to open any of the following URLs
* [Node details](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2595324513)
* [User diaries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/diary)

* day/night settings are different. I'm not sure if I am on default or customised settings here, but swapping from the dark night-time driving display to a bright ""browse map"" display causes unwanted windscreen glare while parking.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,External SD-Card issue since Android 7,[],"Hi guys,
I have an issue with my external SD-Card since my Android phone (Sony Xperia) was updated from Android 6 to 7 last month. I used Osmand+ in combination with Android 6 over a year now and up to yesterday I didn’t notice any strange behavior, but since my phone was updated to Android 7 during the last month and it was time to update the offline maps I noticed that this didn’t work as it used to be. After the map was downloaded only the error “I/0 error occurred: old file can’t be deleted” was displayed and nothing else was happening. So I decided to do a fresh installation. Even with this new installation and trying different external SD-Cards I could not make it work. As long I place the Osmand+ profile folder on the phone storage it works fine. My workaround for now is to do the setup on the phone storage – download all necessary maps, languages, voices, etc – and shift the folder afterwards to the external card. That seems to work, but might be quite uncomfortable if you wanna do this every month as soon the maps get updated. 
Anyhow since Android 7 it seems that Osmand+ has no write access on the SD-Card. Every other app that has access to the card works as expected. After a fresh installation of Osmand+ I adjust the storage to the SD-Card and get asked about the access to media and pictures that I of course allow. I also played around with access as device administrator but even then no change. 
What else can I try do? Thanks in advance for any advice.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Use of AsyncTask.execute(Params...) in OsMoGroups.java,[],"Hi there,

I believe you might have already noticed the behaviour change of Async.execute(Params...) since Android API 11 ([Doc](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html#execute(Params...))). This API is still used on API 11 or later in OsMoGroups.java. E.g. [Line 384](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/73dcab7d0b944e54a7fb08ee0f323e9588a2dfdb/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/osmo/OsMoGroups.java#L384) to start a task to download some files.
 Running the AsyncTasks using this API may still cause some background tasks blocked since they will be executed on a single thread. I think it may be better if the tasks are executed in real multi-thread like you have implemented in other files such as OsmandMapLayer.

It does not make any difference, if the Search function is triggered by the ""magnifying glass"" icon on OSMand's primary screen or from the menu entry ""Search"". 
On my (rather old and slow) device, it takes about 15 seconds *after* the map rendering on OSMand's primary screen has finished for OSMand to settle, in order not to crash when starting a Search.  Hence one should be able to reproduce this issue on faster devices by triggering a Search *while* the map is rendered immediately after start-up. 

Tested with OSMand~ v2.7.5, v2.6.5, v2.6.2, v2.5.4 under AOSP4.1.2 (API16). 
I already sent in a crash report (including an exception log) for v2.7.5 via email (directly out of OSMand 2.7.5: a really nice improvement!), here are the exception logs for [v2.6.5](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/1308503/exception_v265.log.txt), [v2.6.2](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/1308504/exception_v262.log.txt) and [v2.5.4](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/1308505/exception_v254.log.txt); they seem to be cumulative, so [the last one](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/1308505/exception_v254.log.txt) should cover all crashes (throughout my testing) related to this issue. 

Note, that ""Searching immediately after OSMand's start-up"" is a common use pattern, and when testing this (thus quickly hitting the Search icon after start-up), one easily believes that OSMand is always crashing when triggering a Search, as it takes some patience to wait for OSMand to have settled (when testing on a  slow device).

* a one which imports the data in some area around the point
* a one which imports the data in some area around each point around some linear feature like a road. First it should compute the area to be loaded, then decompose it on the smallest number of rectangles with some penalty for loading irrelevant areas, then load the rectangles.
* a one which uses A* to make a route assuming that destination and departure coordinates are known
   * imports data (if needed) around destination and departure points
   * uses kind of A* : uses imported line features to try to make path, if there is no road in the angle to the destination and the region aroud the point is not loaded, osmand loads it and continues A*

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Implementation of public transport data,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Based on the feature request #4425 i was wondering if it might be a potential idea to generally implement public transport data in Osmand, which can be used via optional plugin.
Considering projects like Travic (http://tracker.geops.ch/?z=3&s=1&x=2372635.8903&y=8733365.3751&l=transport) this might be feasible. Besides train schedule data, Travic is even using real-time position of trains, plus it is illustrating the current delay, for regions in which the required data is publicly accessible.
The potential use might be e.g.  awesomely handy route calculation for pedestrian in combination with trains, metro.

Hi! 
It would be nice to be able to download OSM notes, and keep them available when there is no internet connection, so I can go check out the issue locally any time without data connection. 

Maybe it would be enough if the OSM notes could be cached for a certain time, maybe 24h? Or just keep the notes offline until the next time the device is online. (Maybe after a day, the notes icon could turn grey to show that it might be out of sync.)

Alternatively, there could be an entry for ""OSM notes"" in the same menu as the maps downloads. The complete ""planet-notes"" dump for the whole world is currently a bit more that 50 MB.

In any case, if the user replys / closes a note while offline, a refresh would be necessary before uploading the changes.

Besides using OsmAnd for driving, cycling and walking, I also use OsmAnd to track the location and elevation of the plain and the distance to my destination while on flight. To calculate the distance I select a navigation mode (usually pedestrian), go to navigation settings and select the ""Straight line"" navigation service.

It would be nice if instead, OsmAnd would have a new navigation mode for in-flight usage, that uses the ""straight line"" navigation service as a default. This navigation mode can be adapted to calculated the estimated arrival time based on the current speed of the plane.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Feature suggestion: Some sort of remote upload/download access,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","This feature involves some background explanation, so please bear with me...

Soon after I first started using OsmAnd on multiple devices, I wrote a utility to update its maps remotely.  This ran on a desktop computer and fetched the map files from the osmand.net download servers, using the XML index to find what was available, and stored a local copy.  Then it could push them in turn to any device using OsmAnd, by connecting it via USB and using normal file access to the SD card.  The advantage of doing this was that it made it easy to update a number of devices in one operation, without having to go through the exact same sequence of taps on each one,  Because of the single local copy, it also reduced the load both on my network and the osmand.net download servers.

With the tightening of file access restrictions on newer devices and in later versions of Android, in particular the removal of FAT file access over USB and the restrictions on writing to the SD card by arbitrary apps on the device, this became no longer possible (unless the device is rooted, which not everyone would want to do and has its own disadvantages).  Now the only way to perform map updates is within OsmAnd on the device itself - going back to the original problem, each additional device multiplying the load on the network and the download servers.

Therefore my suggestion is for some sort of facility where remote access could be provided within OsmAnd on the device, so getting around Android's file access restrictions.  This could be either a HTTP or FTP server embedded within it (only enabled on demand, of course, with appropriate security to confine its operation to the OsmAnd file area only) to allow map files to be pushed to the device.  Any new files would of course be re-indexed and brought into use in the same way as updated map files currently.

Also most useful would be the ability to both fetch and update favourites.gpx, and also to fetch and update recorded tracks,

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Better audio only navigation,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","# usecase
 I often drive by bike and after I setup my route, I (try) to just follow the audio-instructions by earphones, when I put the smartphone back into my backpack.

# current
In bicycle mode, you only get very few and general instructions. As a result, you have to check the route from time to time, because one isn't sure, if you are still on the right way / which crossing is the right one / ...

# improvements

I know, that this are pretty complex ones, that might result in their own tickets and discussions. But IMHO it's good to get an overview and get an more general idea, if this is interesting (and possible to realize) for the devs:

## use more objects/details (more human style)
Usually an human co-driver would give you very easy to understand hint's, not limited to streetnames. For example: 'take the way right next to the postbox / advertising / shop / ...'`Follow the unpaved road trough the forest`', ' `Follow the road for the next 3 places`', '`It's the yellow house over their!`'

Similar approach is [PERRON](http://62.218.164.207:8080/perron/routing.html?site=perron_vienna) navigator ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/anitagraser/landmarkbased-instructions-for-pedestrian-navigation-systems-using-osm)) but POIs such as cafes might be very rare at countryside. An general approach might be to use unique (small) objects, or objects attribute differences  (which the driver is able to recognize quickly), to explain the course.

## more 'you are on the right way!'
To avoid periods of uncertainties, it would be nice, if the driver gets feedback from time to time, that he's on the way ('`Still just follow this road`'). This also includes (unused) crossing, or leaving roads, etc.

## Indicate longer silence
You will have longer tracks, where no instruction is needed (just-follow-the-road). It would be nice, if you could get an audio-feedback, which indicates that there will be no further action needed for some time and that you just cycle. For example ('`Just follow the road, the next instruction comes in about 15 minutes.`')


I know that esp. the parameters are highly subjective, but they might be evaluated, if we do an survey. For example presenting an Mapillary track and ask people to mark at which point they would like to get which instruction.

Just one last word: OSMand is a pretty cool piece of code :thumbsup: :smile:"

I went for a pretty far bike tour (several weeks) with Osmand as navigation - it mostly worked out pretty good. Compliment for that!
Anyway, there was one source of frustration I had almost every day: When I took the wrong way, Osmand would never tell me. I never had it tell me to ""please turn over"" or something. It would only tell me a new driving instruction when stopping with the distance I had gone since the last driving instruction ASSUMING I had turned over (this can be very confusing). This would be a huge improvement. I'm not sure, but some googling makes me think, this previously actually was a feature.

This was a huge issue for me, as I could not use the display for navigation (where going wrong would have been obvious of course). I actually had bought a bag to be able to use the display for navigation, but had to stop and use only voice guidance, because:
- Phone overheats and crashes, especially with some sunlight.
- Battery dies out way too far (roughly 1% per minute)
When it was raining and there was no shelter, I additionally was not able to unlock the screen to see which way to go, sometimes resulting in going wrong even further, which can be pretty frustrating (am I wrong, am I right?)
I'm not referring to the the cases, where Osmand is able to instantly calculate a new route. This might be working good in cities with many alternative routes, but rarely does work in rural regions with low density of roads (where it is even more bad to go wrong ;-) ).

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Displaying surveillance cameras in OsmAnd,[],"Hello there,

I am planning to map surveillance cameras (man_made=surveillance) in my area and I would like to use OsmAnd for this. So I selected ""Surveillance"" under POI to see which are already mapped. I realized these are way less than are actually in the OSM database. In the area investigated, OsmAnd [displays a single node](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4345485961), while the [Overpass API returns 118 Nodes ](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/r6A) in roughly the same area. 

I further analyzed the cameras displayed in OsmAnd in a larger area. I figured, that only all those with [[""man_made""=""surveillance""] AND [""name""]](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/r6B) are displayed. For the aforementioned node (4345485961) the name tag might be applicable, but most surveillance nodes will never need and hence get a name tag. 

I would like to propose, that the name tag is to be made not mandatory for surveillance nodes and would love to here other opinions :)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Proposal: replace single-select vehicle height setting with input field or..,[],"## .. offer a set of choices of 0.10 meter increment.

Now with a 3.80 meter high vehicle I use for work (or sometimes one of 3.60m) I can only choose 4.00m in the app to be on the safe side in practice - which routes me around bridges I can pass under.
Where I work, Amsterdam, the height of bridges below 4 meters varies by the decimeter. This is also the case in many other cities. In the app though, height can only be increased or decreased by half meters.

In my experience of making deliveries by truck in the city, height is the most restrictive vehicle dimension, followed by width and then by weight. Width cannot be set in the app[*] but is quite restrictive too. So if there could be a setting for that dimension too..

But first maybe someone would please consider allowing the height setting to be more precise ?
> Thank you!

[*] Length neither, but the length and width of vehicles cannot be compared with relevant data from OSM, I guess. If that is so, length and width restrictions as displayed on traffic signs could perhaps be reported and confirmed by drivers through a button within the app. Good idea?"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Automatically enabled Mapillary layer in split screen view,[],"Hi,

The integration of Mapillary data is a good move, good job! It's a shame that the official app isn't FOSS or at least work without Google Play, but it's another story https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary_issues/issues/1124. The display of Mapillary street level picture in OsmAnd is pretty good. However, I think it could be a little bit improved.

Obviously, it's not convenient to keep the Mapillary layer enabled all of the time (cf. because https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/4263 for example). But clicking on a POI and displaying the Mapillary picture is enough in most of the case. That's why, it would be nice if the Mapillary layer is automatically enabled when a street level picture is displayed (in map area of the split screen) and then disabled when closed. Because like this it would be possible to see other pictures and pick an another one easily. Also, it would be possible to see in which angle the picture is taken, which is important to know I think.

Let me know if my point isn't clear enough, I'm not an native English speaker.

A) prevent the navigation from going back to start

Since the above update, the orange map marker now disappears as soon as I move or touch the screen (I am aware this is intentional and that the developers aim to make markers more intuitive for users).

Previously, I found it helpful to have it as a ""sticky"" marker when I was exploring around the area marked. It was simple to remove by swipe-down after tapping the marker to show the details tab.

If one carries out a search (of any kind) and make a selection from the list, ...the orange marker appears as expected on the map, to highlight your selection. However, ...if you now move the map even a fraction (inadvertently or intentionally), your orange marker disappears, and one has to go back to the search again to find your selection.

I'm aware I could leave a flag marker in place, but I'm then left with flags I'd need to click on & remove.

Could the developers kindly consider adding a settings toggle to turn  ""sticky"" on or off for the map markers, please?

I have Pico TTS activated. I tried another app, utilizing pico TTS, which is able to hand over these letters to Pico TTS, which pronounces them (in a german way obviously) mostly correctly.
So i guess the bug is that the german Osmand TTS plugin just doesn't hand them over to pico, as they are not German letters.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,POI prioritization on map,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I'm using OsmAnd+ 2.6.5 (2017-05-31) with it's OSM editing plugin.

Sometimes I feel that the map shows too many POIs and sometimes it's the opposite: I can't find what I'm looking for because I set the POI filter to a wrong type.

Ideally OsmAnd would have a priority value between 0 and 1 for all POIs, depending on various factors like navigation mode (walking, driving or riding a bike), it's distance from the user, is it open now or not, or special needs like wheelchair access or acceptance of credit cards or cryptocurrencies.

Currently OsmAnd let's us filter POIs by type, or use the Nearest POIs option. This is too binary I think, and a customizable fuzzy logic would work much better.

For example:
When you are riding a bike, you would potentially need to know where the free water taps, petrol stations with compressor, bike repair shops, open restaurants, cafes, shops, tourist attractions are, but you don't really need to know about others.
While driving you might be interested in fast food drive-throughs, all petrol stations, restaurants, free parking spaces etc.
Users with special needs like wheelchair users or crypocurrency enthusiasts would choose those places to show it they are available in close proximity.

So the idea is that there would be preset priority tables for the navigation modes, where we could define a priority numbers (-10.0 ... +10.0, -10 = very important and prefer not to have it, 0 = not important at all, +5 = normal priority, prefer to have it, +10 = very important, prefer to have it) for POI tags. Every POI tag would have the value of 0 (ignore tag score) by default, but the car/bike/walking presets would customize these values. 
The POI tags also would get a score between 0 and 100. The scores would be calculated differently for different tags. There would be some obvious one like wheelchair access (yes = 100, no = 0, limited = 50) or internet (yes = 100, no = 0).
The priority of the POI would be calculated by adding all it's tags' priority numbers and their scores, divided by the number of tags in the equation. This way a POI would always get a priority score between -1000 and +1000.

For example:
[Ankert in Budapest, Hungary](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2975011956) is a dog-friendly pub with wifi internet and wheelchair access.  It closes at 2:00.
[Kadarka Kóstoló Bár](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2671786227) is a pub close by, but it's not wheelchair accessible and it closes at midnight.

By default these two places would have very similar priorities, if we are driving close to them.
The situation would change, if it was 1:00 in the morning: Kadarka would get a penalty, it's priority score would be smaller, because it's closed at the moment (opening_hours tag's priority normal [+5], it's score 0) compared to Ankert (opening_hours tag's priority normal [+5], it's score 100).
The preset priority table would be combined with the user's priority table, like wheelchair access (-10 - I don't want to have it, -5 - I prefer not to have it, 0 - I don't mind if the place has it, +5 - I prefer if it has it, +10 - I really need wheelchair access) or credit card acceptance, etc.
If the user defined that he/she must have wheelchair access, Kadarka would be not shown on the map at all.
If the user defined that he prefers dog-friendly places, Ankert would get a higher priority score, but Kadarka's priority would not change, since we don't have any information about its dog-friendliness.

So mathematically every POI would get a priority score by summing all its tags' priorities and their scores, and this POI priority score would change the size of the POI and/or we could hide POIs below a certain priority value depending on the zoom level on the map. If you want to have more results on the map you could adjust the threshold above which priority score should a POI be displayed.

It probably sounds complicated, but I hope you can see some value in it, I think it has the potential to improve the search and POI display significantly.

It's a good car 2A charger and it can really output 2A. I tested it by using AccuBattery app.

I do not approve of this. First, I cannot tell now whether this is the name of the path itself, or just of a route using it, because both are rendered the same way. Second, some of those route names are reather long and cover a lot of the way’s course and details (see attached screenshot). Third, those route names seem to cover the actual path names (the ""Wiesbaden-Michelbach (roter Balken)"" track in my screenshot below actually has the name of ""Eisenstraße"", and was labeled with this in previous versions). 

And apparently, this rendering of route names cannot be switched off.

So far, the option of ""Karte konfigurieren → Routen"" (german version) was used to highlight route relations and offered a very much nicer solution for this, with the coloured overlay which could be switched off when confusing, and stood clearly out from the map itself. 

Please change this back to previous behaviour. I do not need route relation names rendered unless I explicitly switch them on. I surely cannot see any benefit in this but the map is getting confusing and difficult to read, especially with long route names. In motorcar mode, I do not see why I should need hiking route names at all (covering up the next junction which I do need to see clearly).

Currently the TTS says the latter two as ""A three hundred and seven"" and ""B three thousand one hundred and fifty two"" respectively.

I think it is more like a general, Open Street Map feature request. There are many primary roads, highways named with numbers. When the TTS engine generates their names and puts them into the instruction they sound unnatural. 

For example: we have a primary road called ""5"" in Hungary. When OsmAnd generates an instruction to turn right onto that road, it says something like this: 
In two hundred meters turn right here: five.

The ideal sentence would be more like: 
In 200 meters turn right onto the primary road (number) five. 

So, ideally we could define a local, language specific expression for road types to generate ""pronunciation names"" if the name of the road is only a number, or something like M5 (as for motorway number 5)."

Text-To-Speech engines are getting better and better, and OsmAnd uses them wonderfully. Using them abroad gets funny though, when the TTS tries to pronounce the street names in a non-local language.

Theoretically it would be possible to use the user-preferred TTS engine to generate instructions, but use a different, local TTS to generate the name of the streets. This way the tone of the street name would be different from the one of the instructions, but it would allow the user to learn the local names with the correct pronunciation. This would be useful in many cases, for example when you want to ask for a local for directions.

So my suggestion would be to use two TTS engines in harmony: use one native to the user for the instruction generation, and another for the street names. (Obviously they would be the same if the user is in his/her homeland, or if he/she chooses to use the local language for instructions.)"

2. This information sometimes might be useful for at least towns (in the surrounding of a well known city) too.

I guess that this kind of look-up mechanism determining the distance to the nearest city consumes computational power and therefore this information is not shown for each location and search result. If that is not the reason I would love to see this 'near city' information together with the 'is in' information proposed in #4174 for each location and search result.

Please add a kind of 'is in' look-up mechanism to determine and display information about in which state, region or community and country a selected location (or at least a city, town, suburb, hamlet etc. POIs) is in.
It would be great if Osmand can show e.g. that the selected location 'Innsbruck' is not just a city but also a 'City in Tyrol, Austria'. Or that 'Villalangua' is a 'Village in Aragon, Spain'.

In the latter example 'Aragon' and 'Spain' are also the names of the maps available for download and therefore indicating which maps cover the autonomous community or the whole country respectively around the selected location. (Maybe an indication that the loop-up process may not be too sophisticated since the information about region and country is already somehow used.)

This kind of information would also help to identify and distinguish several similar/identical spelled search results in different countries, like the information 'x.y km from city' already shown for hamlets and suburbs does. For that cases, the existing description should be extended by the proposed 'is in' information, e.g. '45.1 km from Huesca in Aragon, Spain'.

I think as a first step it would be a good idea to implement the proposed 'is in' look-up at least for locations/POIs (like cities, towns, suburbs, hamlets etc.) where currently no address look-up is performed. Later on this look-up information could be handsome for any selected or found location.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,In navigation mode zoom fights with map-repositioning and auto-speed zoom,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi, 

while driving I love the map being positioned, so the car ist always on the same position in the map, this is the normal and wanted behaviour. Also I like, that depending on the speed at slow speeds the map is zoomed in, as it is likely, that a change in direction is ahead or mor details are interesting. (But I still
prefer a **much larger zoom while driving on a motorway**, but this is a different story).

My problem:
driving on a motorway I would like to see, whats outside the actual zoom like the exit 10 km away.
When I zoom (two-finger-touch or (-)-zoom) zoom starts, and the missing parts of the map **start**
to be displayed. Sometimes the complete maps changes as the zoom factor displays different details.
Due to the speed of my tablet (Galaxy 4 7"") this can take a few seconds and during this time there is
absolutely nothing readable or helping to navigate on the display. And even **before** the map is
shown fully correctly some back-rezooming takes place, again making the map again unreadable for 
some more seconds.
This happens also when a map redraw due to a new heading is neccessary. Normally this does
not destroy the map, only refills the new visible parts of the map, but while in manual zoom it renders
the map unuseless.

But together with manual zoom the map is destroyed for about 10~15 seconds, my requested zoom is
abandoned in mid display refresh yealding in just another display refresh in to the new direction or 
speed-dependened-zoom. 

It does not happen if the position of the car is moved away from the automatic (lower third) position.
But than I have to manually put the car back to autoposition the map again, which is another distraction
while driving.

Thanks for looking into this

while driving I can use double-finger-touch to zoom, but it is not easy to go back. Sometimes I overzoom

What about using the right side of the display as an invisible slider, so sliding up zooms in (+),
sliding down zooms out (-) as two-finger-tab.
Im mean the area including (-) and (+) zoom buttons up to - but not including - to whatsever displays
at the top right panel (speed, satellites, ...)

So sliding expands the zoom buttons in a perfect understandable way and makes it easy without
looking too much at the display for executing the action, as the side of the display is easy found with the hand/finger.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,new names for modes in bicycle routing,[],"I would suggest to rename the three modes in bicycle routing. 

old naming: **safety, balanced, speed**

New suggestion: **prefer byways, balanced, prefer main roads**
alternative suggestion: **less main roads, balanced, more main roads**
another suggestion: **less main roads, balanced, shorter route**

Reason: The new wording would tell users exactly what the routing engine does. I think users need to get a precise idea to make the right choice. The current naming can even be slightly misleading, in my opinion. Normally it is safer to avoid main roads, but when you cycle at night and are afraid of being robbed, you might want to take more main roads. Also, the ""speed"" mode is not always faster: Normally, it calculates a shorter route, but with more stops at traffic lights. So often, the ""safety"" mode will be as fast as the speed mode. 

I would prefer the third suggestion (if you think it is understandable). It makes clear what you gain on both ends (less car traffic or shorter route).

The best way would be to have a field with four choices - it would replace the field ""use elevation data"":  
1 do not use elevation data.
2 slightly leveled 
3 leveled 
4 most leveled. 

""slightly leveled"" is what I suggest instead of ""hilly"". I think it is clearer like this: We then have a scale from ""1 nothing changed"" to 4 ""big change"". That would be quite intuitive. It would be good to use the same scale also in the more detailed settings.

I think this would help normal users a lot: I have talked to one ""heavy user"" of Osmand (he is cycling 70 km every day), but he did not know that to activate the elevation mode, he had to switch on ""use elevation data"" as well. He thought that it was sufficient to switch on ""leveled"" and he feared that ""use terrain elevation data provided by SRTM..."" would mean extra data consumption.

What version of OsmAnd are you using, on what device and Android/iOS version?
Nightly build 2.7.0 #22070M (but also happens on a previous build), on Android 4.2.2, Samsung Galaxy S4.

Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps?
Offline, 

Both my own map built with OsmAndMapCreator, as well as your offline maps.  Both for US Georgia (mine, built a couple of days ago, but I also tried replacing it with your June 30 map).

If you have an issue related to offline maps, tell us the exact name of the map file where the issue occurs, and its edition date.

US Georgia, June 30, and mine from a few days ago.

What I observed:

First, important to note that the S4 I use for navigation doesn't have cellular service.  It's my old phone that I kept after upgrading to a new phone because it works perfectly fine for OSM navigation thanks to offline maps.  As such, if I'm not in range of my (or open) wifi, it doesn't have a network connection, which I suspect might be part of the problem.

Second, important to note that I was able to successfully open OsmAnd with my map file in place at least once after copying it to the phone.  AND, I have intermittently been able to get it to work on the S4.  I do not have any problems with the same map file on my Galaxy S7/Android 6.0.1 using nightly builds.

Saturday, I got in the car to go somewhere, put my S4 in the mount for routing (not that I needed it for that, but I use OsmAnd to make notes about improvements OSM needs).  Brought up OsmAnd, and instead of the usual displayed map, the map area was blank except for my location and Mapillary tracks.  After a short time, the screen changed from day to night coloring, still without the map.  Tried to open My Places, and it promptly crashed.  Relaunched, tried again, crashed again.  A little trial & error showed that menu items related to places on the map would crash it, but others (Settings, Plugins, etc.) would not.  Rebooting phone didn't help.

Decided to do my trip without navigation, but started transferring a fresh copy of _my_ Georgia map (the same one that I had on the S4) from my S7 to S4 while I was driving, in case of corrupt file.

After transfer finished, moved it to the OsmAnd directory, rebooted, relaunched OsmAnd, the above crash behavior persisted.  I still had the July 5 night build apk on the phone, so tried installing it since it worked for me earlier, but still crashed.  Transferred the osmandToInstall.apk from my S7 to S4 and installed it (it was a day newer than the original version I had on the S4.  I tend to have one on a newer build than the other.).  Still crashed.

When I was getting ready to leave my destination to go back home, thought that the problem might be related to network connection.  *Usually* when I leave home, I set my destination & other settings before I get in the car.  Also, started enabling the new Mapillary plugin and Offline Maps plugin (which I didn't usually have enabled on the S4).  So I disabled both of those plugins, and was then able to relaunch OsmAnd and have it function normally.  Yay.  Reenabled Mapillary plugin, it kept working.  Went home happy.

Once home, reenabled Offline Maps plugin, exited OsmAnd, disabled wifi on the S4.  Not sure if I killed the OsmAnd process or rebooted at this point.  Launched OsmAnd and it worked fine.  Hmph.

Sunday I wanted to go offroading, set a destination in OsmAnd for the beginning of the offroad trail I was going to drive (inside my apartment, with Mapillary and Offline Maps enabled, using build 22070 and my US Georgia map).  No problem.

Got in Jeep, drove to the trail start.  OsmAnd performed normally.  In OsmAnd selected new destination where I wanted to return to paved roads along with a couple of intermediate waypoints to force OsmAnd to route me along the trail and not paved roads to the destination.  It worked great for several hours, including deviations from the route to explore other trails.  Keep in mind this phone had no network connection the whole time.

When I reached the ""return to paved roads"" destination, I wanted to go home, so tried to select my saved ""home"" favorite.  OsmAnd crashed.  Tried a few times, killed the OsmAnd process, rebooted phone, it still wouldn't display the map, would switch to night mode, and still crashed when I tried to Search or open My Places, etc.  Tried disabling the Mapillary and Offline Maps plugins, no help.  Deleted ind.cache, no help.  Gave up, drove home without it (I knew the way, I just like running OsmAnd to help find OSM issues that need fixing, because it's a GREAT tool for that!).

At home, the same behavior continued.  Can't get OsmAnd to display the map and do anything map related without crashing.  (Side note:  when I do try to do a menu function, it *does* briefly display the map before opening that menu function or crashing (depending on the function)).  This is when I tried replacing my map file with yours, and rebooting again.  It still crashes."

It would be nice if they could be added inbetween arbitrary other waypoints. Web routers usually support moving the route to a specific point, then placing a waypoint at this position. Such a moving of a route would be really nice. Alternatively allow to add a waypoint and add an option like ""Add as nearest intermediate destination"" (a better name, anyone?) which means going through all waypoints and selecting the two that are closest to the new waypoint, placing the new one inbetween them.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Problem with bicycle routing using elevation data,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Dear all,

the inclusion of elevation data in bicylce routing is great, but there is still one issue. I experienced it in Vienna: 

With elevation data on in ""safe"" mode, the route is changed to a main road with heavy traffic - but without saving any height meters. 

Maybe the elevation mode overrides other preferences (in this case, the avoidance of main roads in safe mode)? Or maybe the elevation data just get too much priority over other preferences? Another observation hints in this direction: When elevation mode is on, quite often Osmand will take a totally different route, even if no height meters are saved (or only a few). 

I  would like to work in this myself, but first I need some basic understanding of how the elevation mode works. Could someone explain the basics to me, please?

1.) Without elevation data, each way gets a speed (e.g. 25 kmh), multiplied by a factor (e.g. 0.9). So how do the elevation values come in here? Do they add a second factor to each way? (So that you get 25 x 0.9 x 1.2 for example)?
2.) I also would like to get some basic knowledge about the different command lines used in the obstacle_srtm_alt_speed section.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Invalid turn restrictions should be ignored (but aren’t right now),"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","As stated in issue #4051, there was a routing error along the B 1 road in germany which turned out to be caused by a broken no_u_turn restriction which initially had (and was supposed to have) the same way in both the to and from roles (i.e. a ban of turning around on itself) but, when the way was split up, got different (but linked) ways in the to and from members. (For this, the editor software would have to be blamed.)

As a result of this edit, OsmAnd appears to interpret this no… restriction on two linked ways as no_straight_on, regardless of the given via member no longer connecting the two to and from members now, so the TR itself was technically broken.

I would strongly prefer OsmAnd to ignore such technically broken TRs since they are likely to be caused by accident and without any knowledge, let alone purpose, on the side of the mapper. 

Here’s the history of the TR in question. OsmAnd did no longer suggest any route which contained the from and to members in this order, though the via node was not between them, and therefore the relation was invalid.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Match GPX track to road,[],"It would be really nice if OsmAnd could try to match a GPX track to its road data by performing some kind of map matching.

This is an example of navigating along a GPX track with only sparse track points:

In this case the current visualization is still usable. However there are cases where it becomes unclear which road to take, e.g. in [this situation](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/47.30022/12.79184):
![photo_2017-07-07_17-09-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1040784/27964362-51c8f520-6338-11e7-918d-50883abc0736.jpg)

Imagine driving towards this intersection. At first it looks like the user has to keep on the right side of the road (marked with the green casing) due to the exceptional unfavorable position of the GPX points. However the correct decision is to keep on the left road and enter the bridge (marked with the cyan casing).

Also, the current GPX track navigation misses many useful features, like

- maxspeed information (this gets displayed from time to time, but mostly not)
- roundabout exit hints
- lane information
- other useful hints like warnings for pedestrian crossings, railroad crossings, speed cameras, stop signs and so on

Interestingly a T\*mT\*m Rider is able to perform this map matching and is exceptionally fast at it. For a 2000 km GPX track it needs less than a minute. At least this is what the user experiences but maybe the matching is performed on the fly while navigating instead of immediately.

tl;dr: This would be a really nice feature :)

After some time this layer vanishes and no more POIs are shown on the map, although still being activated. Deactivating and activating the POI layer does *not* fix the problem. The only solution is to completely stop OsmAnd and start it again. After a restart POIs appear immediately.

I experienced this a lot of times. I haven't figured out the actual cause but it definitely happens eventually during navigation.

My wild guess is that there is a certain event that disables the POI layer (i.e. it becomes null) and it doesn't get reinitialized until restart. I have no experience with the code though."

It shows a altitude difference of 6m within a distance of 300m. This is almost like 2-floor height. In reality, the actual altitude difference would be within 1 m.

Please check.
 
This is not the only place: Most of the altitude of the state is wrong.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,motorroad=no is avoided in motorcar routing,[],"The following issue just came up on the German Forum: 

When requesting a route from [Paderborn](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/51.7212/8.7582) city to the nearby town of Horn (30 km to the north-east), the by far optimum route is the excellently built B 1 road. However, OsmAnd surprisingly avoids that road, favouring narrow byroads instead.

There is no tagging on the B 1 suggesting such a behaviour. The only suspicious tag is a superfluous  ""motorroad=no"" on some of its ways, which actually means nothing (since it’s the default value when no motorroad=* is tagged) but might be misinterpreted by OsmAnd as an access restriction like ""motor_vehicle=no"" or ""motorcar=no"". 

It should be checked if OsmAnd routing does mistake motorroad=no in the way described above.  

While the issue came up on a ""truck mode"" request, it shows up in standard car mode as well:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Several remaining Bugs in Split Track Analysis (Release relevant),[],"There are several problems in the updated track split analysis code. [Sample track available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByKX_Fubbb4QUFNSQW9MZEtWMVU/view?usp=sharing).

### Split interval markers don't appear in ""Analyse on Map"" unless ""Show on map"" is set

If a split interval is set, markers are not shown in ""Analyse on Map"" unless ""Show on map"" is selected.

Split markers should always be shown in ""Analyse on Map"" if a split interval is selected. (Reasoning: I don't need to select ""Show on map"" to see the track itself on ""Analyse on Map"", so I shouldn't have to select ""Show on map"" to see split markers in ""Analyse on Map"".)

### There are duplicate labels

With a 1 km interval:

![split_duplicate_labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638458/27875211-53070eca-61aa-11e7-8c03-bafd67b93c7b.png)

I would expect each number to be shown only once.

### When splitting by time, labels can overlap at the start and end

In this case, the track starts and finishes at the same place. If I split by 15 minutes, two labels at the start/destination are displayed on top of each other:

![overlapping_labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638458/27875246-6a7341aa-61aa-11e7-9c98-217f8534ed40.png)

I don't understand the 26:54 label either. I would expect this to be either the start time (0) or the end time, which is much more than 26:54.

### What I'd like to see

Ideally I'd like to see splits shown like this:

![cardiotrainer_split_1_small](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638458/27875273-85701334-61aa-11e7-8f12-d6c0ab347cf9.png)

Having distance and time here is very useful. The label placement here is better because they don't obscure the track.

I'd also like to be able to see the times for each km or unit like this:

![cardiotrainer_split_2_small](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638458/27875295-9814273c-61aa-11e7-970d-599e34835a77.png)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Track distance shown incorrectly in summary after viewing track,[],"Some details of tracks (distance, number of markers, and time) are included in the list of tracks.

In the latest code, viewing a track and enabling ""Show on map"" causes the distance in the summary to be displayed incorrectly (overstated).

To reproduce:

1. Note a track in the track list, for example:

![track_summary_fragment_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638458/27874808-c838c73a-61a8-11e7-8462-79e3140f1942.png)

2. Tap the track to view it, and enable ""Show on map"".

3. Go back, either by pressing the arrow at the top left or the standard back button. The track distance is now significantly overstated:

The duration is now also incorrect (understated, or only moving time).

in wiki following definition can be found:

_Insert a highway=stop node on the approach way(s) that must stop, at the stopping point. Drivers may be required to give way (yield) whether or not a physical sign is present; but if you also want to capture the signs, you can use a traffic_sign=* tag as well. In all-way stop countries you could also add stop=minor to distinguish 2-way from 4-way stop signs. 

As this minor road highway=stop node is NOT at the intersection point, we know it just shows the stop line. The roadway approaches that do not stop will have no highway=stop nodes before the conflict point. Do NOT tag the conflict points -- the priority junction node(s)) -- with highway=stop, because not all the approaches will stop. 

Since the stop line on the approach applies to only one travel direction, that direction can usually be deduced by finding the shorter distance to the priority intersection. However, a few stop signs are on 2-way streets between closely-spaced junctions, making it necessary to identify the travel direction that stops. Where needed, this can be done using direction=forward or direction=backward, relating stop direction to OSM forward/backward of the way that contains the highway=stop node._ 

the addition tags diretction=forward or diretction=backward will not be used.

My bicycle computer screen is limited in number of words it can show for a notification, so could it be switched from ""On the roundabout, take ....(the 3rd exit)"" to ""Take the 3rd exit... (on the roundabout.) The text between parentheses is the text my bicycle computer omits. Thank you in advance for your reply!

Instead, it told me where to turn after exiting. The appearance was as if it were an at-grade intersection instead of a grade-separated junction.

Trip from Atlanta area to a suburb of Tampa. To reproduce, you can just use the city nodes for those cities. 

I 75 lane guidance south of Atlanta is pretty complete all the way to the Florida border. Lane guidance in Florida is mostly incomplete except for a few exits in north Florida, until you get to the Tampa area. From the I 275 junction down to the Gibsonton exit, I 75 lane guidance is very good. 

The night builds from about a month ago gave proper lane guidance on the same trip. I will note that more recent night builds have given some odd lane guidance when driving in different areas, but i haven't had the time to work out how to report those. Now it appears to be completely broken. (Note: at the very end, after i had exited the freeway and was almost at my destination, it did give lane guidance on one of my final turns.)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Base background color of area under the maps should = defaultColor in the render stylesheet,[],"I'm finding the background color of the area under the maps to be distracting when rotating or otherwise moving about the map, because this area is highly visible when newly appearing sections have not yet been rendered. For example, see the gray un-rendered section at the top of this screenshot...
http://tkis.com/osmand-bg/rendering.png

This is much more apparent and distracting when setting the map orientation to ""Compass"" or ""Direction of Movement"", because the area extends into all four sides of the display while turning.

To be clear, I'm not referring to the defaultColor in the render stylesheet, but rather the base color of the application under the map itself. I'm not exactly sure what this area is identified as. If someone knows, please let me know so I can locate the color setting for this in the app build.

I've noticed the color of this area changes based on the Map Mode being Day or Night.

For Day Mode, the color is 90% white. For example, see this screenshot...
http://tkis.com/osmand-bg/day.png

For Night Mode, the color is 40% gray. For example, see this screenshot...
http://tkis.com/osmand-bg/night.png

Ideally, this color should be configured to match the defaultColor in the render stylesheet. Doing so would eliminate this distraction and would make rendering apparently faster. Another alternative would be to pre-render an area beyond the size of the display, but this could consume more processing and battery. I'd really like to see this match the render stylesheet defaultColor."

The postitoning of house numbers is currently highly confusing.

In many cases one can't really tell which building a house number belongs to. Furthermore, single house numbers are apparently hidden at low mag, due to limited illustration space.
Is it possible to illustrate the house numbers in the buildings center and maybe reduce the font size slightly to illustrate the house numbers in a less confusing and more structured way?

Also: The reverse-geo results in Woerden are almost all giving town: Bodegraven.

I guess it has to do with the combining of the smaller region maps of The Netherlands into the one big The Netherlands-map.
Bodegraven is in region Zuid-Holland (South Holland),  Woerden in region Utrecht.
Many streets from Woerden are also present in the South Holland map, due to overlap.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Deprecated old-style multipolygons in OSM data,[],"I wanted to inform you about some changes in OSM data recently that might or might not be relevant for you.

OpenStreetMap has finally gotten rid of ""old-style multipolygon relations"". Those are relations of `type=multipolygon` where the tags are on the (outer) ways and not on the relation. For a long time this type of tagging and the more modern one of tagging the relation only have lived side-by-side, but now old-style multipolygons are deprecated and none are left in the data.

If your routing engine/data converter does support routing over areas you might want to change your data import functions to remove handling of old-style multipolygons simplifying the code greatly.

If you do not support routing over areas you might still be affected: Say you have a city square modelled as a relation tagged with `highway=pedestrian`. In modern multipolygon tagging those tags are on the relation only and the ways have no tags at all. If you don't read relations and match them to their member tags, you will not see those ways as routable. So even routing along the edges of the city square will not work. Details depend on the e
xact tagging of course, in many cases the ways will probably also be tagged with a `highway` tag. You have to decide yourself whether this warrants any changes in your program.

Our Github issue for this is https://github.com/osmlab/fixing-polygons-in-osm/issues/33 where you can find some additional information.

Since there are 20+ of them, and some of them have dozens of items checked, it takes me literally hour or even more. I want to suggest command in UI that would save the settings of custom filter (or all of them) in file(s), and another command that will be able to create them based on file(s). In order to do this you can add one more standard folder in ""Android \ data \ net.osmand.plus \ files"" folder, for example ""filters"" -- it will be a storage for saved filter files and for files that user want to restore. I am not sure where is the best place in UI to put this Save and Load command for custom POI filter, obviously there are several places to choose from. Also this would allow users to share custom filter.

I used ""Contour lines plugin"" (that I bought recently) at my trekking trip and noticed that very often there are too few or no altitude labels on the whole screen. This definitely makes working with altitude data very inconvenient, because in order to find an altitude of some place I am forced to scroll back and force to find some altitude label along some contour line, and then calculate in my mind how many lines (and meters) is the point and line in question from the line with label. I attached a few screenshots that demostrate the situation. The solution is to increase the number of labels on contours lines, so the screen would contain at least 5..10 labels.

This is not the best route from Berlin to Puttgarten. But unless the user like on the image zooms out to see the green downloaded maps, it is hard to discover.

IMHO, the user should be told that a route cannot be calculated without the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern map.
In the general case it can be difficult to determine if maps are missing for optimal routing.

The world basemap could be used.
I.e., if the shortest route passes a ""missing"" map using the basemap roads, it means that a map is missing for optimal routing and the user could be warned.

Another problem then is that the basemap is not well connected. But that can be fixed.

However, according to the [Evaluation Tool](http://openingh.openstreetmap.de/evaluation_tool/?EXP=Mo-Fr%2009%3A00-18%3A30%2C%20Sa%2010%3A00-15%3A00&lat=48.7769&lon=9.1844&mode=0&DATE=1497377880000), it is acceptable to use a comma to separate days.

I hope you are not getting tired of improving the bicycle routing. I would like to suggest another feature that will be a big step forward. And it might only take 10 minutes to program for someone who knows Java (I do not). 

Last week I had to work in Vienna, and so I could do some real-world-tests there. I am trying to further help optimize the routing.xml so that it finds a really good way in ANY city. But there is still one problem: At the moment, the routing.xml can either read ""bicycle=yes"" OR ""paved"". The other value is ignored. What we need is a combination: A big upgrade for the ways that have bicycle=yes AND paved (and afterwards, a small upgrade for ways that ONLY have bicycle=yes, etc). 

I have now understood the commands for osmand_highway_integrity_brouting. A short java code like that could solve this problem easily! **There are just a few steps that the program code needs:**

1.) The following code only applies to a) paths, b) tracks, c) footways, d) residential and e) pedestrian.

2.) Create a new value called ""bike_yes_and_paved"". If you find ""bicycle=yes"" AND ""asphalt"" then set ""bike_yes_and_paved"" to ""true"". (Also set it to ""true"", if ""bicycle=yes"" is combined with paved or paving_stones or concrete or tracktype=grade1.)

3.) Create a new value ""bike_designated_and_paved"" (again, set it to ""true"", if ""bicycle=designated"" is combined with any tag that indicates a paved surface).

This would very often lead to a better result in bicycle routing. Could we put this into MapRenderingTypesEncoder.java? That would be GREAT! 

Thank you in advance

Also its put them together with my favoriten (default category) under which i couldn't found them anymore. All operations like renaming the category or changing its colour took much to long (as if the database would have a lot of redundancy that had to be changed)...

Could you please improve the handling of big files, or at least warn users before import if your algorithm is to weak?

Also please dont put them all in the default categories but ask the user where to put them to dont loose track of which are the own and which not.

But much more annoying is that the map is unusable with to much visible points then you have to wait ages to change color/visibility/name of your big category. So you shouldn't do initialisation of all points but only them of them in the viewing area and around it and if you zoom out to much, do some points grouping so that you can have a much lesser memory/calculation footprints. Or just disable map viewable of to big cathegoryes at all and let them only search in table form (what are the nearest points from this one of the category ffnodes?)"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,indoor=yes should be recognised in bicycle routing,[],"Sometimes, the bicycle routing will use long tunnels that lead to subway stations and that are marked as indoor=yes. All ways with indoor=yes have to be heavily downgraded, so that they are only used if they are a really big shortcut (if you dismount and push, and you are still faster, then it is wise to use them). 

The downgrade for indoor=yes is already in the routing.xml, but the routing engine has to ""see"" this tag (it needs to be rendered for the router). At the moment, even if I put the value for indoor to 0.01, it does not have any effect.

Here is an example of a long tunnel that was used for routing in Vienna.

1. Tap Start recording audio note
2. Tap Stop recording, new window appears at the bottom with note info.
3. Tap somewhere so that note info to dissapear so that My location button to be visible.
4. Tap My location to go back to my current location.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Errors at intersections in bicycle routing,"[Label(name=""Offline Routing"")]","Another Issue with the calculation of intersections in bicycle mode: 

Strange detour here (in bicycle mode):
![grafik](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17393264/26757763/5889a13c-48c8-11e7-8e14-020bf4785a5a.png)
It happens with the following settings: highway=traffic_signals 30 and crossing=traffic_signals 16

The detour disappears with lower values (for example with highway=traffic_signals 19 and crossing=traffic_signals 5)
![grafik](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17393264/26757597/a393a0b2-48c1-11e7-8f2a-14e6733b1cd4.png)

It is strange, because when you make the detour over this big intersection, you do not avoid any of the traffic signals: With the detour, you cross 3 signals: First a highway=traffic_signals, then two crossing=traffic_signals.

![grafik](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17393264/26757643/1188699e-48c3-11e7-95e8-8e55c4cde7b1.png)

The problem here is (again) that many crossings that are not marked as a crossing in the OSM data. In this case: Once you have passed the two nodes (the traffic lights), there is no special indication that you are crossing a major road: The residential road that crosses the main road is just marked ""residential"", nothing else (no nodes, no tags that indicate this crossing).

At the moment, this causes a big discrepancy: Many crossings of main roads get NO penalty at all, others get a big penalty. At many intersections, there is even a triple counting of penalties (when we have a combination of traffic lights, crossings, islands, etc).

Here are some examples for NO penalty at all (there is no tag for the crossing in the OSM data): 
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/66514469
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/8149750
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/334070741
These are just residential roads or footways running over a main road, but no node or tag or anything that would indicate this crossing.

Maybe there could be great solution for this (for the bicycle mode): Would it be possible that Osmand calculates a standard penalty (internally) for any crossing of a main road? Something like an extra node (""highway=crossing"") that Osmand automatically adds on ANY intersection of primary, secondary and tertiary road. This penalty could even help to reduce left turns on main roads: For a left turn, you always need an intersection. So if all intersections on main roads get an extra node, this could probably be used to reduce bicycle left turns on main roads.

For cyclists who want to avoid main roads (I think that is the majority), Osmand is already doing a great job. But while Osmand can avoid riding ON main roads, at the moment it can't avoid CROSSING a main road. Therefore, the routing engine sometimes will cross the same main road two or three times just to catch a way on the other side that is slightly better than the way on this side."
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Different routing results on different devices - why?,[],"To allow quicker tests of Osmand bicycle routing, I installed the Android Emulator Genymotion. I created a virtual Galaxy S4, and installed the same Osmand APK as in my real galaxy S4. 

But: The virtual S4 is producing different routing results. In both devices, I am using the same routing.xml and the same settings. 

Is it possible that Osmand produces different routing results on different devices (even if you install the same Osmand version)? Maybe due to the heuristic coefficient? 

Thanks for your help

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Sticky keypad covers the most bottom results when searching/filtering ""my tracks""",[],"Hi,
thanks for the feature to search/filter for (recorded) tracks in ""my tracks"". It is very handy.

But, when typing into the search field in ""my tracks"" the (Android) keypad sticks on the screen and prevents from seeing the search results behind. In contrast to all other search fields in Osmand, in this case the keypad stays in front even when scrolling down to the most bottom search results and therefore covers these results too. Currently, the only way to hide the keypad is to abort searching/filtering by tabbing the back button.

Expected behavior: When searching favorites and when scrolling the search result list the cursor remains in the search field but the keypad is automatically hidden. So all search results are visible. To bring the keypad back I have to reactivate the cursor in the search field by tabbing.

Remove 'Parking' - it's almost a duplicate of 'Personal transport' - it contains parkings and very very few other POIs (car repairs).

Replace the category 'Convenience store and supermarket' with simply 'Food store' covering all shops (and vending machines) selling food.

The problem is the Trunk Link Road.

This is a legitimate cycle route, a major (for here) cycle path terminates just West of here (54.540382,-1.4332737), this Trunk Link Road then crosses the Trunk Road 'A66'  and you then cycle on the cycle friendly Darlington Road to the East.  Using this Trunk Link Road is the ideal route when travelling a route similar to the A66, i.e. from West to East.

This Ordnance Survey mapping colouring appears to support the status of this road:-
https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendata/viewer/?9&437471&516318

Also, although I agree cycling should avoid the Trunk Road 'A66', it is perfectly legal and reasonable to cycle upon it.  OSMAnd refuses point blank to route from a positon on this road.  Surely if you find yourself (mistakenly or otherwise) on this road, OSMAnd should still be offering a route?"

The screenshot shows that the destination is 100 km away but the time to go is only 12 minutes. I think the arrival time / time to go is calculated for the start of the route (or in case of derivation for the time to reach the track again). This is not really helpful and misleading.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Search is much faster if query is copy-pasted rather than typed,[],"Hi,

Search in the latest version has gotten very very slow when typing queries to the point where it is unusable, at least in Paris. However it is plenty fast if the query is instead pasted in the input field. My device is a Oneplus 3T (6 cores [in case search is parallelized]) and the system is clean so it's not the issue.

Forgive me if this has already been reported: I haven't found this issue in the bug tracker but this affects quite a few people and I've been surprised not to find anything about it.

Obviously, this makes me think that there is a search for every input and they're not getting cancelled, making the search time O(n^2) with n being the number of characters typed.

An immediate fix could be to cancel new queries as soon as a new character is typed. This is not optimal but search really is not usable anymore (everyone I know has given up on search in the last version).

Possible better rules for background query lifetime (not all can be applied together):
* don't kill queries but run only one query at a time, with whatever is the most recent text provided by the user,
* run queries only after detecting a word end (i.e. start queries on space, dash, ... typical regexp delimitation could probably work fine) or a timeout (but there might be no universal value for that timeout),
* on word end, immediately kill all queries except the last one,
* cancel recent queries if backspace is detected,
* don't immediately start new queries when backspace is used (use a short timeout, e.g. 500ms)
* run queries sequentially

My preference goes to the first one currently. I think it would improve on every aspect while being simple to implement."

i think it would be helpful for a driver if in some cases an additional ""then use left lanes [to $Destination]"" is spoken by the TTS engine.

one of the cases should be if after a link, the next segment has 2 or more lanes with different turns or destinations.
A complete guidance sounds then like this ""After 300meters, turn slight right [to $Destination] then use left lanes [to $Destination]""

The reason is that all Commercial Navigation Systems i know doing like described (Navigon, TomTom) and that sometimes the distance info is misleading. As an example take this crossing.
https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/52.34007/7.25845
You are going from South to west, using the link, go straight and then the second link to the right. A 31 -> A 30. But the lane assistant is still showing ""turn slight right"" if you reach the second link which is going to east. This is confusing and as far as i can say the mapping seems ok. The additional info ""then use left lanes"" will tell the driver to go through after taking the first link and so preventing him from a wrong turn.

Same goes for if you enter such a motorway cross. Imaging you are coming from east and wants to go south. You need to Switch lanes on A31, otherwise you end up on A 30 but in the opposite direction.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Prefer Destination over Road names,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi,

in case of spoken directions i think it is more useful to the driver to get information about the Destination (if tagged) then information how the target road is named. The reason is that destinations (city names) are written large on signs. Roadnames are smaller in most cases or missing at all, especially on tertiary roads.

Same for the text info on top of the screen. In some cases the [unknown] road name takes the hole space and the useful Destination info is hidden."
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Calculate speed for GPX tracks which don't contain speed,[],"Most GPX tracks don't contain speed (GPX has no standard way of including it), but do include time for each point, so speed can be calculated.

Partly fixes #3702--ideally tracks where speed is calculated should be indicated slightly differently in the UI.

Includes a trivial refactor of this code too:

```java
          if (speed > 0) {
            totalSpeedSum += speed;
            maxSpeed = Math.max(speed, maxSpeed);

          } else {
            speed1.speed = 0;
          }
```

Since `speed1.speed` is always assigned to, it can be moved out of ""if"", and the ""else"" can be removed, because if `speed` is 0 then assigning `speed` to `speed1.speed` will have the desired effect. No need to explicitly assign 0."

Note that OsmAnd UI is NOT frozed white it is doing the saving. I can operate it normally and even add more OSM Notes and then later they get saved all at once as a batch. It looks like they are accumulating on a separate thread but that thread is often stuck waiting on something but it eventually finishes.

When OSMAnd is run on the display it drains 1% of battery charge per minute if the GPS is switched on.

This is happening with or without track recording. As soon OSMAnd is on the display and GPS is on the battery drain at the high rate starts. It does not make a difference if the GPS is locked or not. If GPS is switched off there is no battery drain from OSMAnd, only of the display. Routing is not active. The Android Energy Manager shows that OSMAnd is taking about 40% of the energy, the display is taking about 20%. Normally display 70%, OSMAnd 6%..

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Turn on device screen (if off),"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Much as I like this feature, why do I have to turn the screen off for this functionality to 'kick in'.

I need as little interaction as possible with the phone to get my preferred navigation experience.  Once I've pressed 'Go', that should be it- why do I have to then turn the screen off?

The screen turns off after a period when a navigation point has been reached (or thereabouts)- this should also happen from pressing Go- it should be on for a short while, then turn off, and then back on again as navigation points are reached.

Also, if I want to 'just check' what's going on and press the screen on button, I don't want to have to remember to turn the screen back off again.

Further- turning the screen off on my phone requires squeezing the phone, to get a button on the side of the phone to press, which is annoying in the car, but if the phone is in some kind of pouch type mounting on a bicycle, the off button is often inaccessible (I know a person who glues a ball-bearing into the pouch at a position perfectly lined up with a power button that is otherwise flush with the phone side, so a squeeze of the case presses the ball bearing into the power button).  Turning the screen on requires a press of a front facing button.  On previous phones without a front facing button, as using a side power button is pretty hit-and-miss or impossible, fighting with it once to get the screen on is bad enough, but again to turn it off?

I also recognise that after a navigation point the screen turns off 'quite soon' and this may not be desirable after pressing 'Go' or after turning the screen on to 'just check'.  Could Osmand not use the android screen timeout function more readily here?  Or have a separate setting for a timeout value for turning the screen off after an interaction with the phone?

I noticed a few days ago that the UNESCO World Heritage Upper Middle Rhine Valley (http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/246602883) is rendered entirely in a [pink tone](https://www.pic-upload.de/view-33062965/Screenshot_20170424-175315.png.html) in some important zoom levels.

Since that pink ink is covering (i.e. suppressing) any other area rendering, such as landuses, naturals, riverbeds and lakes, usability of the map rendering is severely impaired by this behaviour.

That area might be outlined in a modest way but not tinted all over.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Can't select a custom colour for a GPX route (regression?),[],"GPX distinguishes between tracks and routes.

Custom colours can no longer be set for GPX *routes* ([example file](http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/gpx_download?filename=national_trails_cotswold_way_2014.gpx)), because when tapping on the route in ""My Places"", only ""Show on map"" is shown:

This is because in [TrackSegmentFragment](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/myplaces/TrackSegmentFragment.java#L340), the split_color_view part of the gpx_item_list_header.xml layout (which contains the split time/distance and colour selection) is set to `View.GONE` if there's nothing in the adapter:

    } else {
      splitColorView.setVisibility(View.GONE);
      divider.setVisibility(View.GONE);
    }
```

The adapter is empty because it is only populated from tracks, not routes.

Being unable to select a custom colour for GPX routes is a problem for hiking routes, as they are often distributed as GPX files containing routes, not tracks.

OsmAnd's own distance calculation plugin also saves GPX files containing routes, so these cannot be shown in a custom colour either.

Workarounds for now are: add a colour to the GPX files themselves, or convert routes to tracks. It would be great to get this fixed properly though :)"

As [this track](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByKX_Fubbb4Qby1ORnN5RmNGSm8/view) has a timestamp associated with each position/point, it is possible to calculate the speed, albeit slightly approximately depending on the geoid used.

One minor problem though is that when viewing a track which has more than one segment, it's only possible to use the charts for the first segment interactively.

When you scroll to the next segment, the map preview scrolls off the screen, and is no longer visible. This means I can't find out what part of the track that segment is for without pressing ""Analyse on map"", which is slower.

To fix this, I think the map preview's position should always be fixed at the top of the window, so it doesn't move when scrolling. The rest of the content can be scrolled as currently. This means that all segments can be easily analysed on the preview map without having to press ""Analyse on map"".

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Regression: Voice output to car stereos broken in latest release,[],"From user complaints I just notice we broke

- **(1)** our test button 11.1 in Development settings / Test voice prompts testing and indicating a device's capability to connect to car stereos via phone call mechanisms. (It is and should not be profile aware, as it detects a device capability, but now acts profile-sensitive)

- **(2)** our settings button 11.2 allowing to adjust the phone call audio delay. (A global setting, but the button now acts profile-sensitive.)

- **(3)** Now that the voice settings are profile-based, things like ""Voice  guidance output"" for the Browse map profile cannot be selected at all: We support audio output (like traffic warning prompts and speed limit announcements) while just driving in our Browse map (default) profile (after stopping a navigation), but we have no menu or interface to select (or even display) which audio settings are used there.

@vshcherb The issue is caused by us making  `AUDIO_STREAM_GUIDANCE`  profile-based (3512b82). Before fixing, it would be good to know if we intend to leave all audio settings profile-based now? (There had been some criticism on the web.)

The issue is in complete analogy to us making all trip recording filter parameters profile-based (see #3437), but having no way to adjust (or even display to the user) the filters actually used for trip recording in the Browse map profile.

- To solve (3): We must either provide menus to also adjust the necessary Settings for our Browse map profile (adding more complications, because only a subset of all profile-based settings matters there), or simply be a lot more restrictive which parameters we actually offer profile-based vs. simply global. I usually lean towards global settings, it removes a certain layer of complexity (like we have to learn for the second time here now).

- If we leave things profile-based, I will have to investigate how to overhaul the BT SCO functionality in a profile-based context, and I foresee this may again not exactly ""simplify"" the overall app configuration for our users.

- Side note regarding (2): In any case, it may make sense to move the phone call delay setting (currently behind button 11.2 in development settings, because it is easier to test from that screen) over to our ""regular"" audio settings. But I do not think we would want that profile-dependent, too?

Using Starbucks as an example, I found quite a few where Starbucks as a building is displayed, rather than cafe or coffee shop, because the name has been applied to the entire building if Starbucks is the sole occupant.

For instances where it is just one of several businesses in a building, and is mapped as a node, it is itemized as a coffee shop.

I think it makes more sense to have the POI's category show up, since that's the information people will be interested in (not to mention it will improve consistency in the results).

Maybe both issues can be fixed if you assume that you usually use motorways on long distances so keeping the route after the motorway link and just recalculate the route to the link.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Automatic driving region overrides manual distance unit setting,[],"I use kilometres and metres in OsmAnd. After upgrading to 2.6, I noticed that the app kept switching to use miles.

Eventually I realised why: in 2.6, driving region detection is automatic. Being in the UK, miles and metres is the default measurement system.

Switching this setting to ""automatic"" is confusing.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Select pedestrian mode.
1. Set ""Unit of length"" to ""kilometres/meters"".
1. Simulate position somewhere in the UK (US might work too).
1. Select a destination which is >1 km away. OsmAnd will show the distance in km.
1. Press ""Go"": TTS now announces the distance in miles, even though the UI (distance remaining, speed, ...) uses km.
1. Close OsmAnd by swiping it away in the recent apps list.
1. Restart OsmAnd. ""Unit of length"" has been set to ""miles/meters"".

As I see it, there are several problems:

* Enabling automatic detection by default breaks manually-set units. It might not be obvious to users how to fix this.
* *Driving* region should not apply to pedestrian mode. It should only apply to car and bicycle derived modes.
* I think units and side of the road should be decoupled. Many people are only familiar with miles or km--they don't understand both. If someone is familiar with km and then uses OsmAnd somewhere which uses miles, they might be confused. For example, if someone from the Netherlands visits the US, will they really want OsmAnd to switch to miles?

My workaround for now is to select Japan as my region since it matches the side of the road and units I want, but this isn't ideal."
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Poor contrast between motorways and trunk roads in 2.6,[],"I just updated to OsmAnd 2.6. With the map style changes, there's now poor contrast between motorways and trunk roads.

Motorways are no longer displayed in blue. I'm so used to seeing them in blue that it's very confusing seeing them in orange. Almost all UK maps (and many others) will show motorways in blue.

The road running east-west near the waypoints is a motorway (M4) but cannot be distinguished from the trunk road going north to Oxford.

The motorways are immediately obvious, even at this zoom level.

At higher zoom levels, motorways are _slightly_ distinguishable from trunk roads (see M4 and A315), but mostly due to the shields:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,consistency of highway=footway and highway=path in pedestrian mode,[],"When hiking, highway=footway and highway=path are equally good places to walk. When Osmand is set to pedestrian mode, it makes sense to render both types of way at the same zoom levels. But right now I see:

Zoom|path|footway
----|----|-------
16 | fine dashed | coarse dashed 
15 | fine dashed | solid line 
14 X | fine dashed | nothing X
13 | nothing | nothing

And with Extra Detail turned on:

Zoom|path|footway
----|----|-------
16 | fine dashed | coarse dashed 
15 | fine dashed | coarse dashed 
14 | fine dashed | solid line
13 X | solid line | nothing X
12 X | solid line | nothing X
11 | nothing | nothing

The zoom levels marked X are problematic because, at least for UK mapping, there are footpath networks which contain a mix of highway=footway and highway=path. These get rendered with unexpected gaps.

Here we see the footpath network through Shawford Down at zoom level 15:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Investigate obsolete 'Keep left' / 'Keep right',"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","There are a couple of areas where I think it would be nice to have some polish on the driving instructions issued, and when.

As a navigator I was always taught 'don't issue an instruction unless it's to change road', and as a driver I completely understand that.  Especially on a motorway, being told every mile or two 'keep right' gets very old very quickly.  I'd rather be told the distance to the point at which I would leave the road I am currently on, and instructions issued for that point only. Also, it seems arbitrary when the 'keep right/left' instruction is actually called - not sure if that's an OSMand issue or something to with the nodes in the OSM data itself. Any chance we can have this as an option?

Also, the instruction 'turn slightly right' can be very ambiguous at junctions.  In line with what I mentioned above, I think for clarity having the option to just say 'turn left' or 'turn right' to indicate leaving the current road and moving on to a new road, irrespective of the severity of the turn, would reduce any confusion.  That way the driving instructions aren't overly verbose - they are clear and concise.  Of course I understand that other people might be used to having such verbosity from other driving aids, which is why I'm suggesting making them optional."

When OsmAnd plots a route, and if the user has selected the ""Snap to road"" option, it assumes that the user will always follow the route, and never be on the parallel road. 

But often this is a case of wrong interpretation: The user is on a parallel road. As a result, OsmAnd continues giving wrong directions (sometimes asking the user to take a flyover loop to come to the other side, whereas the user is already on the correct road).

Recently I observed that Uber app behaves correctly in such cases: It simply jumps to the other parallel road, and recalculates the route.

But OsmAnd does not sense this, and does not auto-correct (re-calculate) the route.

**Desired:** The **snap to road** must look for presence of nearby parallel roads, and if the other road is running close (within the accuracy circle), allow the algorithm to assume that the user is on the other road. At least provide a manual recalculation button that allows the user to snap out of the current route."

osmandapp/Osmand,open,introduce circleexit:lanes for lane recommendation before roundabouts and circular junctions,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","With the implementation in #3298, large circular junctions and roundabouts are now treated uniquely from the navigation perspective, the user is given the exit count. There is currently no lane recommendation before such roundabouts. 

Such large circles often have a sophisticated lane layout, consisting of a sequence of different ```turn:lanes``` patterns. Some are designed in a 'spiralling out' fashion, which has the effect, that queueing in a particular lane at the entrance leads you to a specific exit without changing lanes, or only changing to a new innermost lane springing off from the middle. 

Algorithmically determining the recommended lane for a particular exit might be difficult, since current tagging of turn:lanes insufficiently covers the lane transitions. While there is a proposal for ```placement=*```, it is not well adopted since it is both complicated for the mapper and the data consumer. 

Thus my idea is to have a specific lanes tag at the entrance roads, e.g. ```circleexit:lanes=n|n;n|n```. So when the leftmost lane serves exit 5 and 6, the next exit 4 and 5, the next exit 2 and 3, and the rightmost exit 1, you would map ```circleexit:lanes=5;6|4;5|2;3|1```. So, once the router has determined to take exit 2, it is easy to get the appropriate lane(s) green. The numbers in the tag should be relative to the entrance, so the exit number directly matches the Nth exit announced by the router. 

This tagging should be _in addition_ to the ```turn:lanes``` which represent the arrows painted on the ground. 

My plan would be to discuss here first for feasability, then announce on the tagging list and have a test implementation. Or test first and announce then. I'd be happy to cooperate with the Berlin circles.

_Problem description_
The new one-line “intelligent search” is unusable when offline. When I have an address, say “18 rue Gustave Eiffel, Sainte-Luce sur Loire”, there is *no way* I can find such an address with this search ; I tried.

My phone has its GPS off most of the time to save battery, and getting the GPS to work inside an apartment or an office can not always be done anyway.

Ever since the “traditional search” disappeared, I am unable to perform searches, so I zoom the map to the approximate location, and search with my eyes, after having looked for the approximate location on the computer beforehand!

This is what I was using before:
http://osmand.net/features?id=find-something-on-map#traditional_search
It worked well.

The new search presents only irrelevant results, most of them hundreds of kilometres away from where I am, and it is slow at that… Besides, I don’t get the logic of the sorting order (it seems to be related to distance, but given that I don’t know what origin is considered, I’m not sure)."

I guess it is rather clumsy that a user has to select ""Find more"" for the case nothing has been found yet (and some users may give up at this point). Shouldn't we automatically/programatically proceed with ""Find more"" if there are zero search hits?"

I'd say there's no need to illustrate the house number in such a way. 

It'd be really cool if you could discuss and change the illustration style to be consistent (like the bar) and remove the house numbers.""

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Analyzing GPX track data per split interval (e.g km-per-km analysis for runners),[],"In our new GPX track analysis we have currently omitted the previous possibility to analyze the track and performance data per a set split (distance or time) interval. Discussion with some users indicate this could be a significant regression: Runners want to e.g be able to see their running time needed, average speed etc. per each kilometer or mile.

Suggestion to solve this is as follows:

(1) Let's add ALL available numerical data for a track  (even if it is also shown on the more specific tabs) on the GPX Analysis screen's existing first tab ""General"", rename tab to ""Overview"". That solves all issues with users who need to see all figures in one condensed fashion like we had it before. (Just copy all number buttons from the other tabs below the existing number buttons)

(2) Re-introduce the split duplication of the tabs for the case when a split interval is selected (i.e. one tab per split interval with vertical scrolling, like we have now for segments already). We had this already in the new interface during development, but dropped it at some point. This fixes the pace display for runners. As all data will be on the overview tab, if that tab becomes splittable again, we have re-instated the prior functionality and avoid any regression here."
osmandapp/Osmand,open,Routing bug when using via points,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I've discovered a strange foot routing issue in Passau, Bavaria, Germany:

![tmp_29662-screenshot_20170324-082204116434805](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1040784/24284536/143f1c9e-106c-11e7-9650-dd4e1ff21ce9.png)

I would expect OsmAnd to simply follow the road from the green to the orange marker. Instead it enters an unrelated road right before the orange marker and then makes a u-turn.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,View information about individual points in a recorded trip – point viewer panel,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","There are 2 questions that I often want to know about a past trip:
* ‘Where was I at a particular time?’; and
* ‘When was I at a particular place?’.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the former question, I currently have to view the GPX file with a text viewer, search for the time, and enter the latitude and longitude of one of the points into OsmAnd, which is pretty tedious. The question could be answered much more easily if I was able to specify the time in OsmAnd and view the point closest to this time in a ‘point viewer’ panel. It would be helpful to be able to step forwards and backwards in time, i.e., view the next point or the previous, respectively, as well as be able to skip forwards and backwards in time by a time interval such as 10 seconds. The time of the viewed point may be expressed as absolute time or time relative to the beginning of the track or segment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter question is more difficult, as there can be many times at a particular location. It would be easy to select some point on the trip by viewing the point nearest a touch, but where many points are together in a stationary part of the trip, the time may be arbitrary within the period of being stationary. Being able to step by distance would allow skipping many points at a particular location. For example, skipping forward by 10-metre intervals would quickly find a point when the trip continues from a period of little movement. Likewise, skipping backward by 10-metre intervals would quickly find a point just before the stationary period. The point viewer panel would, as well as the time, also show distance into the track and segment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I also have questions such as ‘How fast was I going at that point?’ or ‘What was my altitude?’. Showing some additional information about the point would also be helpful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in summary, this is what I suggest:
* ability to select the point on a trip nearest to a touch or marker, which displays the ‘point viewer’ panel;
* point viewer panel shows these groups/rows of fields about the selected point:
  * point number,
  * times (absolute time; time into track; time into segment),
  * distances (distance into track; distance into segment), and
  * other fields (latitude and longitude; altitude; speed; etc.);
* the viewed point can be changed by specifying point number, time, or distance – selecting the point number, time, or distance rows allows to change them with forwards and backwards buttons:
  * if point number is selected then the forwards and backwards buttons step by a single point, and pressing again allows to edit the number to view the specified point;
  * if the time row is selected then the forwards and backwards buttons skip by a small time interval, such as 10 seconds, and pressing a field again allows to edit the value to jump to the point nearest the specified time:
    * pressing the absolute time allows to specify a time of a point to view using the standard Android time picker;
    * pressing time into track or segment shows an editable spinner time selector;
  * if the distance row is selected then the forwards and backwards buttons skip by a small distance interval, such as 10 metres, and pressing a field again allows to edit the value to jump to the point nearest the specified distance."

"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Licensing unclear,[],"There are a few parts of the licence that are not entirely clear.

At the beginning, the licence reads:
> The code in that repository is mainly covered by *GPLv3* (for code) and *CC-BY-ND-NC* (for artwork with restriction)
> ATTENTION: please be aware that some artwork has proprietary license.

Here, a clear distinction is made between the licensing of the code and the artwork. However, ""artwork with restriction"" makes it sound like the artwork has some sort of restriction, not that there are additional restrictions for the licensing of the artwork. I suggest using a wording like ""for artwork, additional distribution restriction imposed"". I'm not a native speaker, so I might be wrong.
The second ""ATTENTION"" part is confusing. Does this address the same artwork as mentioned before? CC-BY-ND-NC is a proprietary licence. Is this part a clarification of the artwork mentioned beforehand or does this address something else?

Then there is this part:
> * UI Design and UX work, such as layout, icons is covered by CC-BY-ND-NC 
>        - https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/tree/master/OsmAnd/res and others
>    Restriction to UI/UX CC-BY-ND-NC:
>    * Publishing applications using the OsmAnd UI/UX code to Google Play, Amazon Market or Apple Store must be done with written permission*

You are specifying a directory, but then add ""and others"". Would it be possible to add the other directories to the list so that it is complete? I suspect that the files in the directories don't contain the licence, so there could be files (code, artwork, etc.) where the licensing is entirely unclear.
In the beginning, you made the clear distinction between code and artwork. Here, you are calling it ""OsmAnd UI/UX code"". So is there source code covered under CC-BY-ND-NC or only artwork? To avoid confusion, I recommend using the terminology of the [GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html). The guidelines use the term non-functional data which may be applicable here.

Further below, these terms can be found:
>     * Map icons and their derived primitives are covered by proprietary license:
>        - © icons8.com (https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/icons/svg/icons8)

>    * Generated voice files from TTS files are covered by proprietary license:
>        - Voice files (https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice)

Could you name the licence for the icons and the voice files? ""Proprietary"" itself is not a licence.

Finally, I just want to let you know that the [Replicant project](http://www.replicant.us/) is currently [evaluating if F-Droid respects the GNU free system distributions guidelines (FSDG)](http://redmine.replicant.us/issues/1629). Replicant is committed to follow these guidelines and the guidelines require that non-functional data can be copied and redistributed, both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. It looks like OsmAnd doesn't fulfil these requirements and the project has to hide OsmAnd by default in the F-Droid app listing. This is saddening as there are many Replicant users who are happy users of OsmAnd on Replicant (including myself). I hope that you might someday change the licensing of the app in a way that it is compatible with these guidelines!

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Fix Configure map - show current track,[],"When you are recording a GPX track, you have to go to the GPX menu and not only enable the switch, but you also have to go to the list of GPX files and specifically select “show current track”.  This is another of those “double action” things you have to do to get things working. I think that the “show current track” should a) be on by default and b) displayed as an option on the menu which lets you choose the frequency (5 seconds etc) of the point recording.
These sorts of related things which must be “correct” for a feature to work should NOT be distributed in disparate parts of the UI.  If I start a GPX, then the option for seeing the track or not should immediately be presented to me. It shouldn’t be buried in some menu unrelated to the action I’m taking.
Similarly, there are parts of the UI which are obscure and require online searching to use.  For example, just to enable GPX recording, particularly the onscreen “button”, I had to go to an obscure plugin menu and enable track recording.  Yet, the UI itself has a clear and always present GPX menu with “show current track” on it.  It’s just really messy. "
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Additional reminder for contour lines,[],"The first issue is “contour lines” and getting those working.  Essentially the issue is that contour lines need to be *downloaded* before they can be used. This is not immediately obvious when you are presented with menu options which let you choose at what zoom level the contour lines appear. If there’s a menu option there, you would assume that you should be seeing the lines!  Of course, you have to go to map management and find your area and then download the contours. Ah.  This is not intuitive. I think the contour line menu option should TELL you that there are no contour line maps available, instead of letting you select the level. It’s not at ALL obvious to the inexperienced user.
Likewise, if I select a zoom level for a contour line, I should be told that nothing will appear because there are NO contour line maps!"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Missing hiking route relations,"[Label(name=""Live Updates"")]","Hi,

I noticed that some hiking routes are not rendered on the map. I'm using OsmAnd+ 2.5.4 on Android 6.0.1 (OxygenOS 3.5.6) with an OSM Live subscription.

I tagged some hiking routes with `osmc:symbol` and most of them appear on the map fine. However, I'm missing one of them which does not get rendered in OsmAnd (not even when picking `coloring according to route scope`). I think it has something to do with `osmc:symbol` but I couldn't find a list or description of the rules/symbols OsmAnd is using.

### Additional info:

Map: `Us_florida_northamerica`
Area on waymarked trails: https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/#route?id=7037710&map=15!27.0174!-80.1545 (all relations rendered correctly)

I was thinking that maybe `orange:white:orange_rectangle` is not rendered on the map but this wouldn't explain why that section doesn't appear when selecting a different rendering method. Also, another relation with the same `osmc:symbol` is visible in OsmAnd: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1163455#map=8/28.922/-82.601

I also noticed (might be related) that hiking route relation names in OsmAnd can be different. This particular one was changed 3 days ago (https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/6677191). OsmAnd renders `White loop` as opposed to `White loop (JDSP)`. So maybe relations are not updated as frequently as other map items?

- Tap on the _Distance Measurement_ Icon and select ""_Start editing_"". 

- Tap a spot in the map to set the first point =>  the message ""_Destination not set_"" comes up and no measurement point is placed: total distance remains = 0. If a destination is set, the message the ""_No Info_"" message is displayed instead.

- Disable the Accessibility plugin in _Plugins_ menu (alternative: set _Accessibility Mode_ option to ""Off"")

- Return to the map and tap the Distance Measurement icon again, then _Start Editing_ => this time, the Measurement tool works as expected.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Search by 'operator' tag,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi!

It looks like OsmAnd (Android, 2.5) doesn't check the value of 'operator' tag when you search and some relevant objects might be missing from results.

I've noticed it with ATMs - search by bank name will show only ATMs with filled-in 'name' tag.
But there is [a lot](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/amenity=atm#combinations) of ATMs with 'operator' tag instead of 'name' in accordance with official [recommendation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity=atm?uselang=en-US).

There was a discussion on this issue in 2012 and even some patch:

But if you select language of ""local names"", it behaves differently. When map is zoomed in (close to the details), the local names are used from the map of that region. When you zoom out so that the World overview map gets used by OsmAnd, names suddenly switch to the language of the OsmAnd UI. Thus observing e.g. some capital city and changing zoom, you see the name of the city change from local to a translated name.

The switch occurs when going from zoom 11 to zoom 12. You can try it e.g. on Moscow (you do not eve need to have Moscov region map). On zoom 12 the World map is used too if no region map is available and the language switch occurs too.

This leads to an initial user experience that it sometimes works and sometimes not. (It works when there was some navigation before, and the app was only sent to background. It does not work once the app was fully closed, an update installed, or the phone rebooted. If I want to hear the warnings in non-nav mode, I need to start the routing process first and kill afterwards. )

Currently there is one switch ""Voice guidance"" in Global settings that selects the language. Please provide a second switch, or a tick-box within the language selection, that switches the ""voice warnings"" on/off, to provide predictable behaviour. Having those two switches, I have four options, to hear guidance or not, and to hear warnings or not.

Until a few weeks before, it was possible to search for „Autogas“, and having selected „Show on map“, only such fuel stations offering autogas (fuel:lpg=yes) were highlighted as orange dots, even after closing the search function. I could switch those via the ""autogas"" entry in the ""Map configuration - POI"" submenu. 

This does not seem to work anymore. On actually doing the selection, behaviour is still as expected (only LPG stations are highlighted), but after closing the search window, any fuel station will be highlighted, not only those offering LPG fuel, despite in the „map configuration“ POI submenu only the „Autogas“ item is checked, while all other „fuel station“ items are unchecked. That means, in spite of my POI selection of Autogas only, all fuel stations are highlighted regardless of selling LPG fuel or not. 

Since this has been working as expected up to a few weeks before, there must have a bug come in since.

Despite purchasing and installing **OsmAnd Contour lines plugin** and the plugin being **enabled** out of the box the contours are **not visible** on the map.

The process is currently like so:
* purchase and install contour plugin
* plugin enabled out of the box, but:
  * no contours visible
  * no cues given why not (the plugin won't complain if required data is missing)
  * plugin description **does not** say what needs to be done
  * no link to the help pages (kept elsewhere within the app) from the plugin page
* go to ""Download Maps"", search for the country
  * yay! you've found Hillshades, download:
  * [maybe](http://osmand.net/features?id=contour-lines-plugin) it will work (on-line help pages suggest to search for a country first)
  * Hillshade layer enabled out of the box, but no still no contours
* go to ""Download Maps"", search for the **region**
  * make sure you tap on the region:
  * oh look! Contour lines, download

My problem is with speed_camera announcements (maybe related: https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/3423 and https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/3069 ). 
However, instead of picking some data from openstreetmap, I'm creating my own map.

Brazil got this website, maparadar.com, which got tons of speed camera, traffic lights, etc. I got the data from it, on *.csv, and tried to import it in Osmand. I remember pretty well that I was able to do it easly on older versions (but don't know which one).

Here is the process I'm doing: 
1) get the *.csv file
2) convert it to *.osm file, in a xml-like format
3) use OsmAndMapCreator 1.8 to create the *.obf file

After MANY failures, changing tons of things on the *.osm file, I tried other things, like trying the *.kml file (from the maparadar website). No success. I've tried using csv2osm (https://github.com/OSMBrasil/csv2osm), osmosis (https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis) to convert the files. Still no luck. I can't stress enough that I tried a lot before posting such a maybe-dumb-issue. I've even download the whole *.osm map from Brazil (10+GB) to try to figure out what I could be doing wrong and see if speed_cameras where different there from what I was doing. It seemed OK. I've tried to merge the data from maparadar with the Brazil-osm data. No luck. I've tried using enforcement and just node. _necadecapibiriba_ (brazilian for no-nothing).

I've enabled everything I could on the OSM: Navigation preferences > alerts and announce [radar], details, POIs, transportation, routes, nodes details.

So, I came in here, asking for help, to make this generated map to work on Osmand.

Attached, below, are some of the many tries of generating the maps.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Winter mode for offline car routing,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi,

OSMand offline car routing in mountain can be surpising in winter. For instance I would like to go from Remiremont to Mulhouse through the Vosges, France. 2 roads are available (see the 2 GPX tracks, I just removed the extension because Github won't allow it):

- the first is by the [pass of Oderen](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/740323/Remiremont-Mulhouse.via.Oderen.txt), which is the best way is summer
- the second is by the [pass of Bussang](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/740322/Remiremont-Mulhouse.via.Bussang.txt), which is the best in winter because the pass of Oderen is tricky without snow tyre and the road of Bussang is very straight, at lower altitude, so with less snow.

I think it could be a good feature to have a Winter mode in the offline routing, to take into account the specific condition of winter : road closed because of the snow, prefer straight roads without zigzags, take into account the altitude, etc.
It might be a good idea especially for tourists, who follow the GPS without knowing the country, and might be trapped on dangerous road in Winter without the necessary equipment."

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Pedestrian navigation frustratingly bad. (Route constantly being recalculated),[],"So I was trying to use Osmand for a longer trip recently. And instead of walking about 20 kilometers (which was the original route length that Osmand calculated), I ended up walking for about about 25 instead. Why? Because the route was constantly recalculated. For instance sometimes it wasn't exactly clear if I should a turn into street A (directly next to me) or street B (2 meters in front of me). And as soon as I walked pass Street A, the route was recalculates as if I couldn't just turn around. Do you know what I mean? It's like Osmand doesn't understand that pedestrians can always instantly do a U-turn anywhere without any drawbacks.  
This really needs to be fixed. There should at least be an option to not automatically recalculate the route. So if you walk too far it should simply tell you to go back.  

Just fyi, I tried to look on my phone as rarely as possible and to only listen to the audio navigation and only pull out the phone when I was unsure... but at that time the route was almost always already being recalculated. I also want to mention that it is extremely easily to overlook a small footpath in some places, you really can't compare it to normal roads."

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Feature Request: Instant point-point car navigation usability improvement,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I originally downloaded OSMAnd~ as a hopeful replacement for Google Maps... Unfortunately, it's abysmal lack of addresses/POIs make it completely unusable for point-point car navigation where I live (US-Northeast). I considered this issue for several days until I came up with what I think is the easiest/most efficient use of resources to solve this issue and make the app 100% immediately accessible/usable to the general public.

1) The OSM project currently receives data from the US TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) Map Service. - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contributors#United_States
2) The TIGER project receives it's data from the US Census Bureau
3) A Census Bureau product called Geocoder will return addresses linked to GPS coordinates and offers a REST API.
4) The Geocoder uses TIGER data and their MAF (Master Address File) to return this query.

5) This data can be taken in it's **entirety** from the TIGER/Lines Shapefiles and the TIGER/Line files FTP site found here: 
http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html
ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2016/
6) If OSM is already using the data set (or at least a portion), all that's required is to write the code to link the addresses and GPS coordinates together into OSMAnd.

Right now, OSMAnd is missing a VAST amount of potential users and contributors because reliable point-point car navigation is just not a realistic option for US users (at least in my experience). Once users can actually use the app for navigation, they will fill in the rest of the details regarding any POIs.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Unified elevation data,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Here's a suggestion for improvement of *map display*, *routing*, and *download size*. I'm aware that it would require a lot of work. Also, some of my assumptions may be wrong.

Currently, elevation information is only provided as two optional layers: *hillshade* and *contours* (isohypse). These two datasets must be downloaded separately even though they are based on the same information which is the elevation at any point on the map.

Also, elevation information is not used for routing, as far as I know (I'll gladly be corrected on this). For cars and flat regions this may not matter much, but for bicycle and hiking it is important. For hiking, a rule of thumb is to add one hour for every 400m gained or 800m descended. So elevation would influence travel time, but also the choice of the route: it may be better to go along a flat, slightly longer route than one which has very steep parts.

My suggestion would be to have the app download the raw elevation data (e.g. from GDEM or SRTM) and use that:
- to draw hill shades
- to draw contour lines
- to generate better routes for cyclists and pedestrians/hikers
- to generate more accurate travel times for cyclists and pedestrians/hikers"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Improve visibility of bicycle routes,[],"Hello,

I created a patch to `default.render.xml` that lets users choose to render ""highlighted"" cycling routes (using a selector in the menu). Result looks a bit more like the one from OpenCycleMap, and fixes an issue where the default OSMAnd bike route highlight sometimes has the exact width of the road below, thus looks just like a re-colored road (e.g. making a small rural road look like a high-traffic one).

Picture that explain it better together with the code is in the pull request in resources repo, here:

https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/pull/423

Would it be possible to merge this? Cycling ""experience"" with OSMAnd gets a LOT less clumsy (you don't have to zoom around to see whether the road is really a cycle route).

I'm not sure whether the same highlighting shouldn't apply to the mountain bike routes too. I assumed that since these are mostly off-road (I didn't manage to find a counter-example), the visibility problem won't appear in most cases, and let them unchanged.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Location ""Accuracy""",[],"> This is not an issue immediately actionable in our code, but more a documentation of research on (primarily GPS) ""Location accuracy"", and how we should treat it in OsmAnd. I will continue to edit this post to some degree. If you have anything to contribute, please do.
> 
> 

Position **Accuracy** and **Precision** are significant topics in a mapping app. Accuracy is the degree of scatter of a measurement, while precision describes how well the measurement average hits the ""true"" result. With position detection, precision estimates are desirable, but often impossible to get (when ""true"" position is completely unknown). Accuracy estimates can be obtained easier, but can be deceiving: Even when the estimated accuracy is high, the ""true"" position may still be considerably offset (lack of precision!).

GPS units report **DOP (Dilution of Precision)**, a unitless ""sensitivity factor"", i.e. the lever between the variance of ""measurement data"" vs. the variance of ""concluded position"". For GPS it considers satellite geometry only, no environmental factors or receiver characteristics.

**Position Error**: Ionospheric, multipath, and other environmental factors aside,
`Estimated Position Error = User Equivalent Range Error * HDOP`.
In the absence of deliberate biases (like the former 32m SA) UERE should be a device chipset property (the ""receiver resolution""). It is unclear to me at this point if some or all devices report this or a derived/related parameter somehow in their NMEA strings, so Android can use it. And if yes, if they report a constant, or factor in more circumstantial background. For smartphones, literature often simply quotes UERE as a constant 5m (3m at best), i.e. (in 2D)  `EPE = 5m * HDOP`.

**Android's `getAccurcacy()`** claims to report some sort of horizontal ""accuracy"" in meters (accuracy, not precision!). The documentation implies `getAccuracy()` returns a 1-sigma (68%) Gaussian confidence interval (but unclear over what data, perhaps sliding time-averaged position readings?). It is unclear to me at this point what raw data Android uses or which statistics it performs. From testing, `getAccuracy()` does in deed differ from (and is greater than) `hdop`, and is also not just `hdop` multiplied by a constant.

**Code implications:**
- [x] **(1)** Our **accuracy circle** on the map screen is fine. We show a disk of radius `getAccuracy()`. Limitations: This is accuracy and not precision. And we do not know exactly what Android factors in on different devices to determine it.
- [x]  **(2)** Our **""Precision filter"" in trip recording** is in fact an ""Accuracy filter"" (see above), and its unit is ""meters/feet"". EDIT: Done, wording adjusted and unit added: https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/commit/9176e5a37c824c547dd31c10d23a13daadd4f129
- [ ] **(3)** **Trip recording**: In our **GPX track** we report Android's `getAccuracy()` values in the GPX `<hdop>` tag, which by [TopoGrafix](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) specs is wrong (`<hdop>` is reserved for the HDOP value of the position fix). Not sure yet if we should make a change here, I guess accuracy could/should really be included in a GPX file under `<extensions>`?

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Feature request: create custom profile,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","In OsmAnd+ 2.5.4 we have 3 profiles: car, bicycle and pedestrian.

Those are sufficient in most cases, but where I live, there are no sidewalks, so the pedestrian mode is nearly never used, bicycles are a rarity, but on the other hand scooters are used by nearly everyone. I don't think it would make sense to add a separate motorcycle or scooter profile, because they are not typical worldwide, but it would be nice to have an option to create a custom profile (based on an existing one).
The reason why it would be important, is that all the route calculations' time estimation is now off by at least a 50% margin, since the traveling speed of the scooter is limited. On the other hand there are some routes which can be accessed by scooters, but not by cars, and also there are many parking lots where only scooters and motorbikes are allowed. 
These properties are now ignored, which results in sub-optimal route calculations.

at the moment all cross country ski routes have the same color (light blue) in ski map view (""winter and ski"" map style).

But this seems to result only in two small crossed lines for skating tracks and a single crossed line for mixed tracks (doesn't seem to be documented in the map legend!).

As a skater, classic tracks are basicly useless to me. With the current rendering style it is pretty tedious to distinguish the track types as I really have to look at each and every track section on its own to find a eligible way. Coloring the different grooming styles would ease this a lot. This is probably not to big a deal since the tag is already used und there are very view colors in use in the ""winter and ski"" map style at the moment.

Also the crossed lines could maybe be used for the difficulty tag?

I translate OsmAnd strings almost daily. But it happened that somehow the release of OsmAnd 2.5 still contained some untranslated strings. I translated those soon, but they are still not included even in 2.5.4.

This should not happen as it greatly reduces the apparent quality of OsmAnd to end-users.

I propose to create a process that allows translators (localizers) to finish all strings in time for a release:
1.There should be a period of time before a release of new version when the developers promise to not change/add new strings into the application. This is the string freeze.
2.Then while point releases (2.5.x) are still produced, the translated strings should still be merged into the release (e.g. if somebody translates a string between release of 2.5.2 and 2.5.3, the translation should get into the release.

For 1, the string freeze time should be appropriate for OsmAnd mode of development (I do not ask for 3 *months* which e.g. projects based on Firefox have, but then they have multiple development branches in parallel). Maybe something like 2 weeks. The important part is the imminent release is loudly announced on the OsmAnd mailing list.
For 2, if OsmAnd only has one development branch, then it would probably need to avoid development while important fixes are still pushed into the point releases. So that the strings (and translations) are not branched away from the release branch (which seems to be the case now).

It contains items I do not need and my most used item is always scrolled off the bottom of the screen. This became a problem in OsmAnd 2.5 where the spacing between the items was increased so that the items now do not fit all at once on the screen. It was fine in 2.4. but that was luck. If I had more plugins then again there could be too many items.

So I propose some way do hide items I do not need. E.g. from Video/Audio notes I only need the ""Take photo"" item but not the Take video item.

- Support OLC positions in full-text search. If a full OLC is typed, it is shown as a coordinate.

Example of short OLC (local): `CWC8+R9, Mountain View`
You can use [test application](https://plus.codes) or even google maps for displaying and parsing codes.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OSM Editing: test name=* values for too many capital letters,[],"Please test name=* values for too many capital letters

OSMAnd gives us the possibility to upload new POI to OSM (plugin). This is a great way to contribute to OSM, and I use it often.

There are quite some change-sets made with OSMand that use almost or exclusively uppercase letters for the “name” value. Example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/37042456#map=10/6.6182/2.2961 In practice, this is almost always wrong. Of course you have to use uppercase letters for abbreviations like “USA”. But from what I see in practice, in most cases people use names completely in uppercase letters like “COMPAGNIE DEPARTEMENTALE DES SAPEURS POMPIERS DE L'ATLANTIQUE”, what is wrong. Or you have half of the value in uppercase letters like in “Eglise Catholique SAINTE Jeanne d'Arc d'Allada”, what is also wrong.

The reasons might be:

- Many new mappers use OSMand for their first contributions to OSM, and they might just not know yet that writing in uppercase letters is not a good practice.

- OSMand is used on smart phones, so you don’t have a hardware keyboard like on a desktop computer, so typing is less comfortable and various special characters are difficult to type. Switching between uppercase and lowercase is less comfortable on smart phones. (Also emails coming from smart phones often have more errors that emails coming from desktop computers – also because, when using a smart phone, people often seem to care less about errors as when using a desktop computer.)

It would help if OSMand could display a warning message if too many uppercase letters are used. For a short “name” value with 3 characters, 100% uppercase letters is likely okay (“USA”). For long “name” values with 30 characters, having more than 25% uppercase letters is likely to be wrong. Osmose, the quality assurance tool, implements such a check:

- Class 803 ""Name with uppercase"" : word in capital letters.
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose/issues
- http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/de/errors?item=5010&class=803

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,[Feature request] much larger zoomfactor when driving on a motorway,[],"Hi,
when you drive on a motorway you normally drive long distance.

Abstract: change autozoom behaviour on a **motorway** independent of speed.

My personal idea is, that without a destination the shown distance on the screen 
- when driving on a **motorway** 
should be something like **50 km**. This has nothing to do with speed, even when there
is a traffic jam or slow driving I am interested in the ""big picture"", not in the nearest 100m or 500m.
Most likely I am looking for a way to circumvent a jam, and it is normally to the next exit/entry that is 15 km ahead. Manual zooming is annoying, as it zooms back after autozoom-timeout.

Also the speed sensitive autozoom causes lots or in- and out-zooms. This is specially true, when
your vehicle is a bit slower and driving 100km/h +/- 10 km/h.
- With a destination (or intermediate waypoint) set zoom should be also around 
**50km or the distance to your destination, whatever is nearer**. So you see 50 km until you destination comes into sight.

After leaving the motorway and driving in the city autozoom works great, but I dont want to change
anything in the configuration while driving.

Also the wording ""slightly turn left/right"" may be correct from the angle of turn, but is a more important move. So ""leave motorway at the next exit"" might be more appropiate (or ""leave the motorway at exit number xxx,"" if exits are numbered).

just some idea to make it less distractive while driving

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Map rendering seems to suspend during app startup,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I think it is worth investigating this further, it is the number one nuisance for users with mid-range or low-end devices, where OsmAnd really otherwise runs fine (!), but takes an unacceptably long time at startup.

This issue was not present several months ago, it is a possible regression.

Here is the experiment: Set the OsmAnd map to a certain zoom level (this will be your ""start zoom""). Then kill OsmAnd, and re-launch.

**(1)** Independent of start zoom, it will take a certain time for the favorite layer, Position icon (if there is a fast enough fix), and the hillshade layer (if configured) to display, while the rest of the map is still empty (light gray). On a Samsung S4 Mini time until all this is displayed 9 sec, quite acceptable for everyday use.

**(2)** Interestingly, if your ""start zoom is in the range 6-10, also the forest portions of the map will already be displayed at this time!

**(3)** Then it takes some additional 20-30 sec (!), where the map rendering receives no visible update, until all of a sudden all roads and other map featured are added rather quickly (roughly at the usual speed of rendering during normal later app operation).

So whatever takes so long in between step (2) and step (3) is the ""extra time"" we added at some point, which needs investigation. It must be something we somehow initialize after showing the forest in step (2).

**(4)** If the start zoom is >=10, the forest will not display after 10 seconds, so in these cases the user sees an empty (gray) map with favorites and position icons visible. (In this situation some users conclude the app does not detect the map at all, and kill the process and/or give us false feedback.)

**(5)** If the start zoom is exactly 9, the map after step (2) displays all forest areas, and the lines where roads will end up are already depicted in dark gray, before rendering seems to suspend

**(6)** If the start zoom is <=5, no forest is shown (as we do not render then), but it also takes the extra 20-30sec until the roads (or al very low zooms the national borders) are finally rendered.

The limit zooms for (4) and (5) may depend on device and screen magnifier, perhaps indicating this is merely a matter of ""how much gets rendered before the interruption""

So in summary, it seems we somehow suspend / interrupt map rendering somewhere between showing the things (often up to the forest) in step 2, and showing the rest of the map. What do we do which apparently interrupts all rendering? Can we change init order here?"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OsmAnd Editing: uploads incorrect opening_hours to OSM,[],"OsmAnd has a limited parsing of the opening_hours tag. This is understandable, the rules are very complicated and I don't think there is any application that supports the full ruleset.

However, the OsmAnd application needs to accept it's shortcoming, and be honest when failing to interpret a certain value.

One thing it must NEVER, EVER, do is modify a misinterpreted value and upload that back to OSM!

Example case: [node 1291410148](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1291410148) included opening hours exceptions for the holidays. Not the most complicated rules, but for example ""Dec 27-30 18:00+ off"" which means earlier closing times on those days. It seems like OsmAnd does not support ""off"" in combination with hours at all.

Opening this node for modification in OsmAnd, and then uploading without actually editing anything, writes the misinterpreted value to OSM.

Original value in OSM:
Mo-Fr 09:00-20:00; Sa 09:00-18:00; Dec 1-24 Su 14:00-19:00; Dec 7-24 Sa 09:00-20:00; Dec 12-22 Mo-Fr 09:00-21:00; Dec 24 **13:00+ off**; Dec 25-26 off; Dec 27-30 **18:00+ off**; Dec 31 **16:00+ off**; Jan 1 off

Value after uploading from OsmAnd (and not editing anything):
Mo-Fr 09:00-20:00; Sa 09:00-18:00; Dec 1-24 Su 14:00-19:00; Dec 7-24 Sa 09:00-20:00; Dec 12-22 Mo-Fr 09:00-21:00; Dec 24 **13:00-24:00**; Dec 25, 26 off; Dec 27-30 **18:00-24:00**; Dec 31 **16:00-24:00**; Jan 1 off

There is two things that need to change in OsmAnd:

(1) If a certain tag is not modified by the user, then OsmAnd must always maintain the original value, literally and without modification, when uploading. No ""fixing"" or ""optimisation"" done by OsmAnd. (Modifications that are not done by the user are considered ""machine edits"" in the OSM community, and should always be discussed before execution.) This original value should also be the one offered in the ""advanced"" tag editor in OsmAnd, not a (mis)interpreted one.

(2) OsmAnd needs to perform a grammar check on the opening hours value before allowing edits to it through the GUI widgets. If a value fails OsmAnd's interpretation (that is, OsmAnd does not understand every single word of it), then editing (of the original, uninterpreted value) should only be allowed through the ""advanced"" editor."

if(precision > 0 && (!location.hasAccuracy() || location.getAccuracy() < precision)) {
    record = false;
}
```

Logic in this code was inverted: points with accuracy below (i.e. within) the minimum precision were rejected, and points with accuracy above the minimum precision were incorrectly accepted. 

For example, if the minimum precision was set to 20 metres, all points with an accuracy under 20 metres were incorrectly rejected, because `location.hasAccuracy()` is true, `location.getAccuracy()` returns (say) 10, and 10 is less than the minimum precision (20).

Each of those changesets per junction, comparing multiple aerial views, mapillary imagery and own ground survey, costs me about 30-60 min. 

Today I found some other mappers competing for this rank. Good. But, when I looked at their changesets, I found them drawing one building from Bing, or even adding one address with no proper source given, in each. Uploading several changesets per minute, until they reach the number of the first rank, than hopping to another region across the world. Changeset comments ranged from meaningless to misleading. Source tags were partially wrong.

This makes peer-reviewing their changes difficult, and blows up the databases. And I don't think that these kind of changes are what the OSM-live users expect when they are paying their fee. 

A first mitigation would be to limit the payment for mappers to one region (until they start account spamming), but probably the whole system needs to be reconsidered. "

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,TTS voice not always set correctly by OsmAnd's setLanguage(),[],"# Summary

I have found an Android configuration option which unexpectedly makes Osmand UK English TTS sound
a) better, and
b) the same as every other Android TTS app, where previously I have always found it sounds much worse.

# Details

I have always found Osmand's TTS to sound weird. Osmand TTS sounds different to every other Android TTS app. My experience of the ""osmand voice"" has been relatively consistent over three phones, many factory resets, and countless updates to Osmand and Android, since I first wrote about this problem here in 2013: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/GdzC2wxQjQE
I have got used to how it sounds, but invariably any guest in my car would ask about the weird voice.

My settings are I think pretty standard for a UK user:
* In Android / Settings / Language & input:
  * Language is: English (United Kingdom)
  * Under Text-to-speech output:
    * Google Text-to-speech engine is selected. Settings are:
      * Language: use system default
      * Under ""install voice data"", I have ""English (United Kingdom) Voice set 1"" which was automatically downloaded after factory reset when any app (usually osmand) first uses TTS.
    * The ""listen to an example"" button says ""This is an example of speech synthesis in English"" in a good, pleasant, English-sounding voice. The same voice can be heard in every other Android TTS app except Osmand.
* In Osmand:
  * Display language: System (Device language) [and all text is English as expected]
  * Voice guidance: TTS voice English (United Kingdom)

Using 'test voice prompts' option I get a list of only one option: en-gb-tts
I can confirm osmand is using the right voice file using because ""attention, pedestrian crosswalk"" is spoken as ""attention, pedestrian crossing"". But it is spoken using a voice which is hard to understand. Definitely *not* the same voice that spoke ""This is an example of speech synthesis in English"". I have never heard this ""osmand voice"" from any other Android app.


However, back in Android / Settings / Language & input / Text-to-speech output / Google Text-to-speech engine, what would we expect to happen if I change the language from ""use system default"" to ""English (United Kingdom)""? Note that ""English (United Kingdom)"" *is* my system language.

As expected, this has no effect on the ""This is an example of speech synthesis in English"" output. Nor have I have noticed any effect on any other TTS Android app yet. However this change causes Osmand to use the normal Android TTS voice. For the first time in my experience, Osmand voice guidance is easy to understand.



So it looks to me like something in Osmand causes Google TTS to go wrong when it (Google TTS) is configured to ""use system default"" language.

I have about 10 country maps downloaded and several German states. Suppose I am currently in Germany and looking at a Bavaria map and I want to search for Bangkok, Thailand. If I enter ""Bangkok"" in quick search, it takes at least 10 seconds (sometimes 15 seconds) to find on my Galaxy Note 3 because it first finds and lists more than 40 Bangkok restaurants in Germany before it shows the city in Thailand. Then I tried to switch the map by searching for ""Thailand"". This also took at least 10 seconds to find because there are many restaurants mentioning Thailand in their names. Entering ""country thailand"" in quick search did not work either.
Please let me have back traditional search, for example on the Search button in the menu as you did when quick search was first released (leaving quick search on the Search button on the map). Then I can choose country Thailand by entering two characters (th) followed by Bangkok with two characters (ba).
I also tried to use Google Maps to copy the geo URL to Osmand, but searching on a url like www.goo.gle.com ... in Osmand didn''t work either, although this syntax example in shown in your help.

If so, it would be nice to have an option to change the type of notification Osmand creates.

Of course my map files were not found there. So I tried to revert setting 'data storage folder' back to 'external storage 2' /storage/XXXX-XXXX/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files. This unfortunately results in error message 'Maps could not be created in specified directory'. So it seems that I am also affected by the well known difficulties accessing external SD, since I updated to android nougat.

I tried to analyze this using logcat and compared the situation with cm13 to cm14.1 [logcat.zip](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/files/614198/logcat.zip)
There are suspicious warnings from android packagemanager `PackageManager: Not granting permission android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to package net.osmand.plus because it was previously installed without`. These warnings are (i) not unique to osmand and (ii) also occur in cm13. The only difference is that in cm13 these warnings occur only once, but twice in cm14.1

I already tried various suggestions given in related thread #1838 but without success.
Any help or instructions for further analysis welcome!

Perhaps OSMand needs to be updated according to https://developer.android.com/training/articles/scoped-directory-access.html"

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Fix loading of custom rendering files containing dashes and underscores (regression),[],"After I upgraded to OsmAnd+ 2.5.3, I noticed that my custom rendering file could not be selected. I got this toast: ""Exception occurred: renderer was not loaded"". Several people on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/w9111YDV_r8) reported the same problem.

I couldn't see any exception in logcat, so I investigated in more detail. In src/net/osmand/plus/dialogs/ConfigureMapMenu.java I could see that the toast is generated if this code returns null:

```java
app.getRendererRegistry().getRenderer(renderer);
```

`getRenderer()` only returns null if the specified renderer cannot be found, or an exception occurs. I added some debug code and found that the specified renderer could not be found, so null was being returned here:

```java
    if(!hasRender(name)){
      return null;
    }
```

`hasRender()` just checks that the supplied name exists in one of two collections: `externalRenderers` and `internalRenderers`. My custom renderer was an external one so I dumped `externalRenderers`:

```
externalRenderers: {GPX_routes_without_dashes=/storage/emulated/0/osmand/rendering/GPX_routes_without_dashes.render.xml}
```

Immediately I realised the problem. My custom rendering file is named GPX_routes_without_dashes.render.xml. Its entry in `externalRenderers` is `GPX_routes_without_dashes` but OsmAnd is looking for `GPX routes without dashes` (spaces instead of underscores).

This used to work. I think it was regressed in 7fc7b5aa373c8fdd8d65429de4c168a2b2bd4f59.

The fix is to apply the same processing to each renderer name when inserting into `externalRenderers` as when creating `visibleNamesList`."

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,osmand forgets old data directory,[],"Hi,

I have a Samsung S4 with the osmand directory originally set up on the SD card, 

`/storage/extSdCard/osmand`

First of all, whenever I open osmand now, I get the 'first steps' screen. When I close osmand than and reopen it, I usually get the main screen after 2-3 tries.

Then, it appears that osmand loses the location of the data directory periodically, and creates a data directory 'osmand' one level below where the actual osmand data should live. This has the effect that currently, on my cellphone, osmand has the data directory path set to something like this:

`/storage/extSdCard/osmand/osmand/osmand/osmand/osmand/osmand/`

I didn't do that.

I also have intermittent problems to write to the SD card while recording a track, so this might be related to #3105.

When I reset the data directory in the settings screen to `/storage/extSdCard/osmand/`, osmand sometimes works properly and sometimes it doesn't (no map shows, but other functionality seems to be fine). 

Whenever I close it and open it again later, it will usually jump one directory level deeper, with an additional osmand/ subdir. Regardless of whether it managed to display the map correctly.

Using Android version 2.4.7 from F-droid on Android 5.1.1 AND 7.0. Using the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download. I downloaded Cambodia country file from today (15.8 MB). 

1. Search for Cambodia capital `Pnom Pehn` using an English device. The city is displayed, as expected, with its name. (using either `name:en` or `int_name`, I don't know which one is used since they have the same value).
2. Zoom on the city so that the city fits the whole screen. Zoom a bit more.

## Expected:
Either `Pnom Pehn` should continue to be displayed, or some lower elements should replace it.

## Actual behavior:
`Pnom Pehn` is replaced by the Cambodian value of it eg tag `name` (រាជធានីភ្នំពេញ).

Maybe this is because English value cannot fit the screen anymore while the Cambodian one can, but I think this is a bug."

I've been using OSMAnd with Polish TTS quite a lot recently. While the quality is usually good, there's one annoying feature which sounded ridiculous to the bystanders.

It's how it reads ""turn left into 297th"" - which obviously means road #297. The Polish translation is incomprehensible (""skręć w lewo w dwieśćie dziewięćdziesiąty siódmy"").

My question is: is it possible to distinguish road numbers in ttsconfig.p so that it reads ""turn left into road number 297"", like all other navigation apps do? I can contribute the translation and figure out the .p file syntax and make a pull request if that's possible.

I believe that this can be changed in assemble_street_name in https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/voice/pl/config.p#L165 or in the CommandBuilder https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/73dcab7d0b944e54a7fb08ee0f323e9588a2dfdb/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/voice/CommandBuilder.java#L157 if the Prolog engine is not smart enough to detect a numeric string.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Improve trip recording,[],"As a carry-over from #3235, we want to re-evaluate:

**(1**) Making al trip recording setting global (i.e. the whole trip recording plugin settins screen)

**(2)** Produce no dialog upon starting a recording and create a global setting of interval. (I agree we should create the global setting, but we **should still keep the existing dialog** where a user can opt our by checking ""Remember the setting"". Because this dialog exactly enables on the fly configuration once we make the interval setting profile-independent. I use it a lot with different intervals for e.g. jogging vs. hiking.)

We have not discussed further but this article http://osmand.net/features?id=trip-recording-plugin#Trip_Logging:_Some_Basics_on_Parameters_and_Filtering contains 2 more small ideas we could consider:

**(3)** In the speed settings, introduce a line item ""speed>0"": rather simple to introduce as a line item in the current speed filter settings: This would use the GPS chipset's motion detection (it would record only points where GPS reports a speed>0). We could implement as an additional float value of 0.00001 or something, with a proper display value saying "">0.""

**(4)** For the cases where we turn of GPS between recordings, I have a feeling we might improve the recording quality by either introducing a short wait time between the first GPS fix and recording a point, or by sampling e.g. 3 consecutive points and recording only the one with the lowest getAccuracy() value."

(1) So I think we need to set the preset for the default profile to ""0"" ?  (Equally for SAVE_TRACK_PRECISION and SAVE_TRACK_MIN_SPEED, but there it currently is anyway.)

Please note that post-processing a track where points have been pre-filtered at recording time (in specialized GPX software) is more involved and less reliable when no points for the device being at rest are recorded to the file at all, as the GPS chipset's motion detection is circumvented. (I also had to adjust our OsmAnd built-in track analysis with a workaround to try discover at-rest situations while no points are logged). So we should at least provide a way to remove all filtering, if not even make this the default.

(2) Also: Changing the app profile during a recording seems to adjust the filter settings on the fly, not sure this is by design? (It is not obvious to the user and may 'cripple' recordings to some extent.)

- Often, (not always, not sure), I see the spinner turning there and it never finishes or takes very long (minutes), as if OsmAnd somehow has no access the tracks folder (screen remains empty).
- Also, when trying to stop recording and saving the track now (via the GPX widget), the widget seems to hang in status ""Save"" (The track can finally only be saved after the next app start.)
- Also: If you now go to ""Download maps / Local"", also there the file listing seems blocked, with the spinner on that screen turning continuously ...

From Fr-Su the location is always shown as closed although it is defined as open in the OSM Data.

According to http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours the OSM Data is correct. ""Because of the definition that following rules will overwrite previous once, times which span over midnight have to use additional rules which are separated by comma instead of semicolon.""
Also the opening hours evaluation tool at [http://openingh.openstreetmap.de/evaluation_tool/](http://openingh.openstreetmap.de/evaluation_tool/?EXP=Mo-Th%2007:00-01:00,%20Fr%2007:00-02:00,%20Sa%2007:00-02:00,%20Su%2008:00-01:00) shows the opening hours as they are."

![287px-zeichen_332-20_-_ausfahrt_von_der_autobahn _stvo_1992 svg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/755451/19872481/3f5c5518-9fba-11e6-851b-7635fd9ba1e3.png)

Currently it is sometimes very hard to pick the correct lane and exit when using osmand. Some other applications show destination signposts that look exactly as the ones you see in real life on the highway; it is then much easier to pick the correct lane and not miss your exit (I'm aware that osmand support `turn:lanes` tags, but even with that I find some complicated exits very challenging without seeing the actual signpost contents).

For example, this is from Mapfactor Navigator:
![zue0iwn](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/755451/19871895/56197b62-9fb7-11e6-985b-25e23a5f66e2.jpg)

The blue sign shows the same information as the real signpost and helps user navigation tremendously. Osmand doesn't currently display that. If you could implement that, that would be awesome.

> What version of OsmAnd are you using, on what device and Android/iOS version?

OsmAnd~ 2.4.7 from F-Droid (planning to switch to the paid version to support the project), Google Nexus 7 (Android 6) and Motorola Moto G (Android 5)

> Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps?

Offline maps, but with mobile data connection.

> If you have an issue related to offline maps, tell us the exact name of the map file where the issue occurs, and its edition date.

I haven't seen destination sign anywhere with osmand, and I know mapfactor navigator displays them in my area. I also tested this by simulating user position (using osmand debugging mode) and trying this route: 
https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=osrm_car&route=49.16061%2C16.57347%3B49.15120%2C16.60092#map=15/49.1559/16.5990
That particular [highway exit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/5375480#map=19/49.16038/16.59476) has correct `destination` set:
```
destination=Wien;Znojmo;Mikulov
```
The [highway directly before the exit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/289221299#map=19/49.16062/16.59294) even has `destination:lanes` set:
```
destination:lanes=Olomouc;Uh. Hradiště;Bratislava|Olomouc;Uh. Hradiště;Bratislava|Brno-centrum;Wien;Znojmo;Mikulov
```
However, when I simulate driving through that exit, I see no such information in the osmand. There's no signpost displayed on the screen (I've found reports that osmand might be actually _saying_ some of this information, but I'm not really interested in speech, I'd like to see it displayed).

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Use GPS heading (not compass) when available for marker direction arrows,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I'm using OsmAnd+ 2.4.7 on a Samsung Galaxy S5 with Android 6.0.1.

On several occasions, I've noticed that the direction arrow included in the marker ""top bar"" is based on the compass heading, not the more accurate GPS heading.

Example:

![osmand_marker_issue_1_small](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/638458/19837784/008e6ce2-9eb9-11e6-9a3e-0bef78dffe59.jpg)

As you can see, the marker is almost directly east from the current location, but the marker arrow points south west.

Several other apps like GPS Status display the GPS heading when travelling above a certain speed (usually 4 or 5 km/h):

![gps_status_small](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/638458/19837792/50cfbdd2-9eb9-11e6-9dd3-ce3ab671e26c.jpg)

This issue could be related to #3005 but there's not much detail there for me to be sure. Also, that issue talks about extrapolating position, rather than direction/heading.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new, active marker.
2. While moving (either real or simulation), observe the direction arrow in the marker's ""top bar"".
3. Rotate the phone. The arrow changes direction, proving that compass heading (rather than GPS) is being used.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,"Make airport searches search for terminals, not the center of the area including runways","[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Airports are ususally tagged as aeroway=aerodrome on a huge area than includes the runways, terminal building, parking lots etc.

If you want to drive to an airport, and search for the airport in Osmand (by name or by transportation/airport) and use the result as the destination, Osmand will use the center of the airport which is oftern many km from where you would actually want to go - which usually is to the departure area of an airport terminal, or maybe the parking lot next to the terminal. 

And worse, if Osmand do take you to the opposite side of the airport it can be very difficult and time consuming to get to the terminal because there are no roads going that way.

I think it is reasonable to expect that if I tell Osmand to take me to e.g., Copenhagen Airport, then it will take me to where the terminals are. Instead Osmand once took me to Flyvergrillen http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/173525958 . Which is a good spot to watch airplanes, but useless if you want to get inside an airplane.

I propose that transportation/airport and name searches for airports prioritize aeroway=terminal over aeroway=aerodrome.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Idea: Why Osmand should have OBDII plugin,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Osmand should have integration with OBDII adapters. Simply because getting data directly from ECU can move Osmand to another level and get improved driving experience.

How? All cars approx. since 2003 supports OBD-II. You can buy simple small adapter ELM327 (price starts about $2 ) and connect it directly into car. This adapter proviedes data over bluetooth or wifi directly into your phone. Now it's turn on Osmand, which picks all useful data and process them into enhancing navigation experience.

What can OBD-II connection proviede to Osmand?
- actual speed of vehicle (useful in tunnels or when GPS is out)
- fuel status (thx @hakuchi )
- when driving and ""Check engine"" lights up, it can offer you closest repair center
- and much more!

Who? 
We need our hero! Someone, who will write this great plugin and gets all glory!

osmandapp/Osmand,closed, THOR algorithm for OsmAnd ,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","OsmAnd needs a new routing algorithm for car mode because of bad performance. Graphhopper and OSRM do not fulfill the requirements because they don't support conditional edge-weights at query-time. This is necessary to support options like avoid highways and so on without the need for a separate CH-graph for each combination of options.

It should be investigated if THOR algorithm (Tiled Hierarchical Open Routing) which supports multi-modal routing can be implemented in OsmAnd to replace the current routing engine.

"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Double-check conceptional issues of our enriched trip recording,[],"Several issues worth checking here, let me first summarize what I think we were trying to achieve:

**(A)** The logging interval still strictly defines our **sampling rate** for when we log a point a all. (So this is our raster, not just another filter dimension.) Nothing happens between time-defined sampling points no matter what (and we even turn GPS off for sampling >=30sec to conserver power).

**(B)** Now we add an additional distance filter to check if at such a time-defined sampling point the position has a certain minimum distance from the last point logged, or else we discard it.

**(C)** We also add a speed filter to see if the point handed down from the GPS chipset has a certain (small) minimum velocity, or else we discard it. I assume what we really intend here is not really a low-speed cut-off, but rather checking if we are basically in motion, right?

**(D)** We also added a precision filter to discard points which do not fulfill a minimum quality criterion. (I guess what we really should try to achieve here is to make sure we always capture the best track which can reasonably be acquired under the given circumstances)

Here are the issues I think I observe:

**(1)** Logging is basically a device-global action and/or should be treated as such. Its parameters should not depend on the profile of some app. (It is not even clear what profile is used, because you can start logging from the notification bar now. Or you can change the OsmAnd profile after logging has started - very intransparent.)  I think we need to make all manual logging parameters global settings, and also ensure once again that whenever you start logging, the master sampling rate dialog is displayed (unless the user has set a default to not see that dialog again). I see the good intention in having profile-dependent defaults and settings, but think the complexity added kills the feature here. (And the settings are obsolete, see below).

**(2)** The distance filter was a much needed addition we now have. This is likely the only additional setting we should keep. Please note that in all reviews of our app we are criticized for being too complicated and cater for things not 1% of users use, but complicate things for 99% of the userbase. When balancing usability vs. features, we always seem to err on the ""feature"" side :)

**(3)** Speed filter: We really only want ""motion detection"", right? And even if you happen to stand at a stop light or have a short breathing break during a hike at the time the sampling is to happen (e.g. 5 minutes on backcountry expeditions), you probably wanted that point to be recorded once, rather than omitted? I think functionally there is 99% overlap with the distance filter here, where this is achieved much simpler. I vote for removing the speed filter, I see no use case. Using a low-speed cut-off for recording may produce side effects if you do not clearly understand our logic of how we sample and record, which again 99% of our users will not.

**(4)** Precision filter: Again: I guess most users would want to automatically record the best precision possible, but not filter any points on the basis of settings they do not understand (and their effect they cannot verify?) I vote for an automated solution like this: If a point fails a certain precision (say hdop>=6), lets immediately take 2 (or 4) more at a 1 second spacing, and record the best of the 3 (or 5). No settings needed.

Please note that our ""Precision setting"" is flawed conceptionally, hdop is **not** anything like precision in meters. hdop is a scale for reliability under given reception conditions, something 99% of our users will not be bothered with. (It is roughly like this: 1 = good, 6 = fair, >=10 = useless.)

So as I did look in your FAQ, but I cannot find clear information abut when HTTP is used and when HTTPS.
1. The most important question first: (When) Is any location information send over HTTP?
2. (When) Is the login data (for OSM) send over HTTP?
3. What other requests to OpenStreetMap are unencrypted?
4. What requests are encrypted?

You may thing about adding this information to the FAQ or the app directly.

In any case you should however try use HTTPS every time when it is possible. the OSM site is available in the HTTPS version for years. You might check the links I have above.

Additionally the OSM module in OSMand has the URL `http://openstreetmap.org` in it's description shown to the user. It is not really nice to see that `http://` there, as this might make users think data is send over (unencrypted) HTTP connections. I'd suggest you to either change this to `https://` or just leave the protocol out. 

Finally I of course hope you verify the ssl/tls certificates correctly as this is a mayor problem on Android.

So to summarize:
- [ ] We need more information about when HTTPS is used and when not.
- [ ] When HTTPS is not used (yet), try to use it.
- [ ] Do not use `http://openstreetmap.org` in the description.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Issues with GPS config items interoperation,[],"All the following is about GPS trip recording plugin, I think.

The case: I want to enable background GPS trip recording with some interval.
Have two alternative flows:

1)
a) Configure 5 or 30 sec GPS wakeup interval by the satellite button in top right corner. Not to be confused with general logging interval in plugin's settings.
b) Start track recording by another button in top right corner.
c) Check GPS wakeup interval: it switched to continuous unexpectedly.

2)
a) Start track recording by the button in top right corner.
b) Have to stop background mode (satellite button in top right corner) and then restart with 5 or 30 sec wakeup interval. There is no possibility to just change the interval without restart.
c) Background logging is stopped unexpectedly. The stopped status is shown only in OSMAnd notification (not on OSMAnd screen).
At the same time track recording is active and wakeup interval shown as properly configured, so the status in notification could be easily missed.

Expected behaviour for all of that follows. If there are some internal reasons, it's good to have them documented at the plugin's help page. For now it gives only simple and obvious instructions.
- Starting track recording should not unobviously reset wakeup interval. Merge these two dialogs, maybe?
- It's better to have a possibility of changing wakeup interval on the fly, without restart. Not very important, though.
- Changing wakeup interval (by restarting for now) should not stop background service.
- Three mandatory interface controls (two main screen buttons and one notification button) is too much and hard to understand. There is also some intervals in plugin's settings in addition...

To be more clear, I'm a fan of huge number of settings while they are easy enough to understand and operate.

Related ticket: https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1903

Unrelated:
I see that general logging interval has an influence on the wakeup interval (default value, at least).
Does it work in another direction? I mean, setting some value for wakeup interval affects logging interval or not?
It should affect (and be obvious), as for me, since some of the updates (either GPS fix or track file) are useless otherwise.

Remember that the user often holds the phone in his/her hands and the phone camera is directed down to the floor. So the first image is almost everytime a photo of the ground or doesn't focus the target entirely. Please fix this.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,GPX track recording: Motion detection / minimum velocity / minimum position change,[],"I'm often recoding GPX tracks, e.g. while hiking, and make every now and then a pause of a couple of minutes. Osmand keeps recording the GPX points every X seconds. Depending on how long the pause is, there are a lot of GPX points around my static position which increase the total length and altitude of the track I hiked, although I was just making a pause.
I have seen in several apps that they have some kind of motion detection to prevent this. E.g. they just save a GPX point if my velocity is greater than X or my position with respect to the previous point has changed by Y.

I tested this with [GPS Logger](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=logger&fdid=com.mendhak.gpslogger) and when the minimal accurancy is set, it produces nice lines on the map even with larger logging interval.

However, the reasonable minimal accuracy may be dependent on device and maybe even on external conditions (forest, mountains, tunnels). Maybe the condition for a nice accurancy could be something like ""wait max X seconds after getting fix if accuracy or until accuracy is getting better"" to automatically adjust desired accuracy using heuristics to guess whether it makes sense to wait a little or not.

in the latest F-Droid version (2.4.6) I was not able to find any option to avoid too steep roads and it would be good to have one (maybe even two, different for up- and down-hill).

Rationale: there are urban areas where you can go the easy way (which is longer when looking at the 2D map) and a crazy way (driving straight over a high hill), and Osmand usually prefers the crazy way.

I know there is the commercial ""contour lines"" plugin in the Play store but according to the description, it can only display the lines or shading. But if it cannot influence the routing algorithm it's not really helpful.

- moving faster than 30km/h

Then make the icons larger by about 50 percent (see attached mockup, before/after).

An additional idea would be: give the user a way to enlarge some of the status symbols. For example, the current and maximum allowed road speed.

I have a hunch - my GPS receiver is flaky, the fix is not precise, appears or gets lost every minute. When such zoom jumps happen, the speed indicator also displays random walking speed, 4km/h or 16km/h or 24km/h or something. The moments when this ghost speed changes seem to correlate with the zoom level changes.

Then make another calculation (a car or train trip to somewhere close to the target area). And when arrived at the site, I would like to reload the previous route calculation for hiking.

Right now you cannot do that. You could add both kinds of destinations to the same route plan but it's bad because the waypoints for hiking are not accessible to cars and the routing goes nuts all the time.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Incorrect highway badge shown,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Or perhaps I should say, highway badge shown in incorrect location.

What version of OsmAnd are you using, on what device and Android/iOS version?
Android Play store release 2.4.7 (2016-09-19) on Android 5.0, and nightly build 2.4.0#18549M (2016-09-24) on Android 6.0.1.  But, problem also observed in the previous play store release, as well as numerous nightly builds.

Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps?
Offline maps.  In the Play store release, I'm using your monthly standard map builds.  In the nightly build one, I'm using my own map created with OsmAndMapCreator (the 4/24 release of it).

If you have an issue related to offline maps, tell us the exact name of the map file where the issue occurs, and its edition date.
Play store version:  United States of America Georgia, Standard map, dated Aug 31, 2016.
Nightly build:  my own map of Georgia created from Geofabrik's 2013-09-23 .pbf file.

The badge I 575 should not appear where it does in the attached screenshot.  I 575 ends just above the bottom edge of the screenshot, and becomes Georgia highway 515 from then on.  I've checked the tags in OSM around the area where the badge appears, and both the ref tags and route relations appear to be correct.  The badge remains on that road segment even when I scroll the map so that I 575 is completely off the screen.

Location of the misplaced I 575 badge:  http://osm.org/go/ZQuscnO?m=
Location where I 575 ends:  http://osm.org/go/ZQr_scZ?m=

On a related note, the ""A"" badge you see in the screenshot is...unexpected.  While that section of highway _is_ part of the Appalachian development highway system known as ""Corridor A"" (and is a member of a route relation named ""A""), there is absolutely no signage along the road designating it so.

I'm only mentioning the ""A"" badge because it appeared in the same screenshot.  If you decide this is a ""won't fix"" it wouldn't be a big problem.  It's just not correct in that there's no signage reflecting that designation, even though it is a proper designation.  The I 575 badge is definitely not correct where it appears, although I wouldn't call it a high priority issue (routing and voice guidance appears to be right, it is a display-only problem).

In general we dont need any voice guidance when going straight over a crossroads junction. This is true when two roads cross (whether on car routing or bike routing), or when one cyclepath crosses another (on bike routing). There are lane markings etc which makes the ""straight over"" option easy.

Thats not true when following a cyclepath which crosses a road. This is a significant event which justifies having voice output.

Not having any voice output when cyclepaths cross roads has proved to be misleading on a couple of occasions recently. A good example is at http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/50.88221/-1.24473
When following the red arrow the voice output is ""turn left"". It is referring to the blue turn, but it is very easy to mistakenly think it means the green turn. Ideally this would say ""cross [road details] then turn left""

According to a [discussion on the OsmAnd forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/w9111YDV_r8), this is caused by someone adding [place=island for Great Britain](http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/6038068).

This ""Great Britain"" label is distracting and annoying. It appears over paths and roads, even in navigation. Examples:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Osmand Crashing when redering maps on MIUI 8,[],"Hello everyone.
I always used Osmand+ (paid version) and Osm Live on MIUI. It worked. The redering was certainly slow, but it worked more or less.

Yesterday I upgraded to MIUI 8 (with full wipe), and everything works fine, excepting OsmAnd+. Now it crashes every time it tries to render. Seems it's something at the final steps of rendering, because I have 4-5 seconds until it crashes. (Maybe near contour rendering)

I tried to activate Safe Mode and works, but it is hard, because I should be faster than the render, or it will crash before i click the option. 

I tried on other phone with MIUI 8 and it also works, seems the problem is with android 4.4.4 + MIUI 8. My phone is a Xiaomi Note 4G Single Sim.

Today I did a fatal mistake: I activated LightRS and now it renders faster and I can't activate Safe mode anymore or disable LightRS before OsmAnd crashes.

I read in some other issue that Safe Mode will disable itself by design if native code loads correctly. But for me Safe Mode is the only way I can use OsmAnd now. And anyway, I also had slow rendering when native code was working, so is not a problem for me.

I'm going to need some external way to tell osmand to not to load native code, and/or activate safe mode. For example, using some sort of config file.

Please, any kind of solution or temporal fix would be greatly appreciated, as OsmAnd is a very useful tool for me.

Thank you!

Nightly builds running on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Android 6.0.1

With the nightly builds, using US Georgia map dated Jul 31, 2016, with this morning's OSM Live update for Georgia.

With the Play store version, using US Georgia map dated Jul 31, 2016, no updates.

With the map centered here http://osm.org/go/ZQqvF2A4t?m= press the Menu button in Osmand and select search.  Create a custom filter for Restaurant and begin to search.  You should get the first screen of POIs OK, but when you press Find More and then scroll down, before you reach the bottom of the extended list of POIs, Osmand will hang for a few seconds, then crash.

I have verified that if I move the map to a location farther away, such as here http://osm.org/go/ZQrpxgQB8-?m=   then I can get a longer list of POIs before it hangs.

Note:  you can achieve the same results by just using the default Food category.  I used custom filters to try to narrow down which sub-category might be the problem.  I have not observed the problem with other categories yet.

I don't know if it's a bug in Osmand or a malconfigured POI (in which case it might still be considered a bug in Osmand if it is not able to work past malformed data).  If it is a restaurant POI with bad data in it, I haven't yet been able to figure out which one.  Hopefully a debug build can show that?

I've considered the possibility that the problem might be related to the recent opening_hours fix in #3021 but unless I can find the specific POI causing this (if it is in fact a POI problem), there's no way I can tell.

- accents: for example the nearest town from my place is ""Bélâbre"", if you don't type all the right accents, you don't find it, which is really tricky because it's many times not possible to know only with the pronunciation, so as in other systems, ""é"" ""è"" ""ê"" or even ""ë"" (only used in the west of france) should be considered the same as simple ""e"".
- more tricky: the town ""Vendoeuvres"" is written ""Vendœuvre"" in osm. we call that char ""e in o"", it's the right spelling but it's really old-school deprecated char in french and you don't even think about using it when trying to find your destination. ""œ"" is not even existing on a french keyboard!
  so ""œ"" and ""oe"" are equal
- isolated places: in my place there are more isolated farms than 'normal' addresses like number+street, here no number and street, only a farm name. all the other navigation systems can find that kind of places when looking by addresses, isolated places should appear with street names.
- region: i live on the frontier between 3 regions, it's really hard to know if the next village is in the region ""Poitou-Charentes"" or ""Region centre"" or ""Limousin"", is it really necessary to start by a region field? it's the first navigation system i try that works like that...

For people that have well-maintained address book contacts (synced via CardDAV or not) with addresses, it would be very practical to be able to use these via My Places folder called `Contacts`.

In this contacts folder, each contact/address combination should be made available. An address would be a combination of:
- Display name, e.g. ""John M. Smith"" or ""Restaurant Jimmy's""
- Address type, e.g. ""Work"" or ""Private""
- Address, e.g. ""123, Sunset Boulevard"" or ""Dorpstraat 123""
- City, e.g. ""New York"" or ""Amsterdam""
- State/Province, e.g. ""NY"" or _none_
- Country, e.g. ""United States"" or ""Germany""

The name of the place would be a combination of display name and address type, e.g. ""John M. Smith / Work"". The address should be parsed to separate the house number from the street name, an approach based on the value of country could ease this. State/province is optional and also largely dependent of the country. If one of the fields is empty (except state/province) the address is not considered to be offered.

Read-only generated examples from the data above are:
- Category: static, ""Contacts""
- Name, required e.g.""John M. Smith / Private"" or ""Restaurant Jimmy's / Work""
- Description: contains of concatenations with new lines of:
  - Country, required
  - State/Province, optional, empty line when n/a
  - Address, required
  - Number, required

Additionally, if enough fields are available but there are some parsing problems, this could be reflected in offering this address non-functional, but only with a warning indicating what should be done in terms of editing the contact in order to improve the usability of that address. Addresses should not be looked up because the availability of certain maps in OsmAnd and of the addresses in the maps can fluctuate.

**TODO:** What needs to be discusses is **when** to go from country, state/province, city, address and number in description to Lat+Lon. Probably each times a new contact/address is found or an update has been detected.

Implementing this would reduce the amount of places where address information is maintained and manually synced. It also reduces the looking up of address while driving, providing a safer use of OsmAnd. This could be developed as an plugin which registers itself in the synchronisation services of Android.

GPS alone is often not precise enough to fix onto a particular lane. Thus, IMHO the current road display could profit from: 
- directional analysis of the movement, and correlate with oneway directions
- connectivity analysis, thus assuming a transition to the next connected highway segment with high probability, while jumping to an unconnected is unlikely. This might also make the geocoding more fluent with increasing road fragmentation.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Some files can get corrupted when using multiple OsmAnd versions in parallel,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","When using multiple OsmAnd versions in parallel (e.g. stable and nightly) and using the same data folder (for reducing required storage) some files can get corrupted. This seems especially apply to files which get often re-written by OsmAnd, for example _regions.ocbf_, _poi_types.xml_ and style files located in the _rendering/_ directory like _default.renderer.xml_.

With corrupted files several different exceptions might occur on startup.

This exception seems to belong to a corrupted _regions.ocbf_:

The error messages that OsmAnd will display to the user aren't particularly helpful. Yet fixing these issues is for the user very easy: just delete the corrupted file (_regions.ocbf_, _poi_types.xml_, _default.renderer.xml_ etc.). They will get re-created by OsmAnd on startup.

Since the manual fix is very easy it seems to be a good idea to implement an automated fix in OsmAnd. If loading of one of these files fails then just re-create it and try loading it again (once). This should make OsmAnd more robust against such errors.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Turn target name not updated ahead of some junctions,[],"nb-2016-08-23

Normally the name of the street the next turn leads to is show very early, up to 1200m even on a tertiary road. On some junctions however, the current road display remains even while standing at the traffic light. The turn target is shown very briefly when already on the junction. Voice navigation is not affected, the turn and the target name are announced early enough, and pressing the turn button repeats the target name, while the street widget is still stuck. 

In this context, the blue ""current road"" arrow becomes confusing, it could be read as ""carry on""; the crosshair icon originally discussed in #2862 would be less ambiguous. 

The examples below were experienced twice in real driving, while other junctions were correct, so the bug seems to be systematic:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,(Germany) Wrong shields for tertiary roads starting with A or B,[],"Using Osmand 2.3.5, with current Germany-Bayern-Europe.obf map downloaded from within the app.

I've noticed a funny little bug with the shields for tertiary roads in Bavaria. 

E.g. in this area in Augsburg-County:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/48.4080/10.6822
there are tertiary roads that have the refs ""A 33"" and ""A 5"". Also, the Autobahn ""A 8"" motorway is close by. 
Osmand 2.3.5 seems to see the ""A"" at the beginning of the ref as an indication that the road is a Autobahn / motorway. The result is, that the tertiary roads also get a blue motorway shield with just the number ""33"" and ""5"".

Same issue close to Ansbach:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/49.2760/10.6810
Tertiary ""AN 12"" gets a blue shield ""N 12"" (the A has been cut off).

It also works with ""B"" (for primary ""Bundesstraßen"") as seen close to Bayreuth:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/49.97073/11.52803
Here, tertiary road ""BT 14"" gets the shield ""T 14"" in the same style as the primary ""Bundesstraße"" B 85.

This may only affect Germany and maybe only Bavaria (other German states have other naming schemes for their tertiary roads). I haven't checked other countries since I don't know where to look for possible errors.

Probable solution: decide the style of the shield by looking at the class of the highway, not at the letters of the ref. Use the full ref for tertiary roads.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Creation/deletion of favourites takes too long,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I am a OSM mapper and I use OsmAnd also very often for OSM mapping.
Especially because of the live map updates, FIXME layer and the background tile layer it is a very good tool for OSM mappers.
But there have been some changes, which make the creation/deletion of favourites much too slow.

There are three reasons, why creation/deletion of favourites is that slow:
1. Forced reverse geocoding.
2. Every time a favourite is created or deleted, a new packed bz2 backup is created, this takes very long.
If I remember correctly, favourites are already stored in a database and exported as GPX.
The database alone and a delayed GPX export should be robust enough.
3. If a duplicate favourite is created, an annoying message appears, that the favourite has been renamed, which I have to close every time.
This is often the case, if I capture house numbers (many duplicates).

I really hope the experience for OSM mappers could be improved.
Especially high speed house number capturing, for example if I am in a bus, tram or car, is simply not possible anymore.
Maybe make it possible to turn off this feature, which I usually don't need (reverse geocoding, favourites backup, duplicates message)?

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Walking street/parish info request,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Using latest OsmAnd 2.4 on Android 4.4.4:

While out walking I wanted to know the parish (administrative boundary) I was in. OsmAnd will display the nearest street name to the current position easily enough, but it would be good to tap that and see a more fully qualified location address. For example, nearby building address number/name (if within a certain distance), street name, nearest village/city, name of encompassing administrative boundaries (from e.g. parish) up to country level.

For example, 52.58306 1.36188 when tapped geocodes to ""The Street, Framingham Earl"", the street name and nearest place=village. However, what I was expecting to see was ""The Street, Framingham Pigot"" (street and parish, since the nearest village is in the neighbouring parish).

Nominatim gives the expected output for the reverse geocode: http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/details.php?place_id=63783996

Could something similar be done with OsmAnd to selective hide/show based on containment? It may still be useful to mention the nearest village outside the geocode.

The common thread seems to be that some setups of osmand write these files to the private data area. When the gpx tracks are ""shared"" via Google/Drive/Beam/Skype they are unreadable and the transfers fail.

For example: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/iIbByH5zUFY and http://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/07/21/cyclinggps/

Please note this is apparently depended on setup, and some people have had success chaning the storage location _before_ recording tracks.  Is there a solution for those with files trapped in private storage?

It's tagged with `turn:lanes=none|none|slight_right`, as it should be according to the blue street sign. The actual junction node is tagged with `motorway_junction`, and the exit way is tagged as `motorway_link`.

Using offline routing, TTS told me to ""turn slightly right"" when taking this exit. I'd like the voice to say something like ""take the exit"" or ""take exit 5"" (or whatever number the exit might be).

I might also have experienced TTS saying ""keep right"" in similar cases if there are no `turn:lanes` tags, though I can't remember any concrete examples to show this.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,[Feature request] Adding default speed limits by coutry,[],"The issue description from user:
There are may roadways in OpenStreetMap that are not tagged with any particular speed limit. In those cases OsmAnd does not give any speed limit information, and of course no warnings if you exceed the limit. This is a shame, because there are default speed limits, known as implicit speed limits and well documented as such: wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed) Because of this, tagging of speed limits in OpenStreetMap is generally not really needed, although possible, except on specific pieces of road where the normal default speed limit is inappropriate (too fast) and so a lower limit will be sign-posted.

Do you think that it will be possible, in future versions either of the application or of the extracted OSM roadway information, to make available the appropriate speed limits. For a start, it would be a big help already if for example roadways in France tagged as highway=residential were automagically given a speed limit of 50: i.e. when highway=residential but without any maxspeed tag, then treat it as though it was also tagged maxspeed=50 & source:maxspeed=FR:urban. Perhaps you already apply some similar logic, so as to estimate travel times when making routing choices, but didn't think it useful to display the resulting speed limits - I think that you can, and should. Perhaps you could add a parameter so that the user would decide, if speed limits are being displayed, then should implicit limits also be displayed - or not.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Simplify UI to plan, route, and navigate",[],"Following the discussion in #2958, I understand the intention to simplify the user interface for quickly starting to navigate. However I still have two steps after I found a target, first I have to press the route button, then again the Go button. Further, the interface is different when I  came from a favourite or from address search. Screenshots below. 

![screenshot_2016-08-18-09-48-21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8266355/17766793/20f5de9a-652d-11e6-8361-d447f79160fd.png)

Thus I propose to unify the interfaces as below, showing prominently the buttons for ""Cancel"", ""Plan"" (set destination), ""Route"", and ""Go"" (turn-by-turn).  Thereby, ""Plan"" is a subset of ""Route"", and ""Route"" is a subset of ""Go"", thus the buttons are ordered in this sequence. 

All fav editing and point sharing can go into the menu (reached from the 3 dots), I'd prefer to keep the setting cog wheel visible. 

An advantage is that when I select ""Plan"", the route calculation does not start immediately (which currently makes the device sluggish when I want to continue setting further destinations).  And when ""Plan"" is selected, we can get the air distance and red arrow again.

When navigating from http://osm.org/go/ZQqt9neRY?node=2692168557 to http://osm.org/go/ZQqt~l_L7?node=1894137664, OsmAnd improperly tried to direct me onto the pair of link roads leading to/from Powers Ferry Road (see attached screenshot), instead of through the intersection.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,opening_hours interpretation issue,[],"OsmAnd versions 2.4.3 (released 2016-08-11) and nightly build 2.4.0#18150M (released 2016-08-17), on Android.

I've noticed a problem in how OsmAnd handles opening_hours fields that include some of the more exotic combinations of values.  I am **not** referring to the difficulty in handling those values to display the red/green closed/open feature (e.g. the ""PH"" issue brought up in github #2610 ).

For this supermarket http://osm.org/go/ZQqt~l_L7?node=1894137664 the business hours field is:
opening_hours=Mo-Su 07:00-23:00; Easter off; Dec 25 off

However, OsmAnd displays this as ""Mo-Su 07:00-23:00; Mo-Su off"" in red, all the time, even when the store is open.  (Screenshot attached.)

I understand that it may be a very long time before OsmAnd can handle things like PH and other extended possibilities, but (to my way of thinking, anyway) it should be able to discard values in opening_hours that it doesn't know how to process, and at least show red/green appropriately.  In particular, there seems to be a bug in that it substituted Mo-Su in place of Easter and Dec 25 (which is my main point).

As a side note, would it be possible to work on adding specific-date parsing ability, so that it can handle dates such as ""Dec 25""?  Values like ""PH"" will obviously have to wait for a good solution, but I'd think a single date (or list of them) should be do-able.  ""Easter"" might be more difficult, even though it can be calculated (or found in tables) for the next few millennia, for the simple reason that it would depend on which country you are in (the Eastern Orthodox vs. Catholic/Protestant difference in calculation), which relates to the ""PH"" problem.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Online nominatim address search does not display search results,[],"Hi thanks for fixing the recent issue with the July map updates with  the new version of OsmAnd+ 2.4.3 however with 2.4.3 I am now seeing problems with searching when using Online Nominatim - Address.  I have online maps plugin enabled but when searching for a street OsmAnd+ either:

1) displays no search result (also there is no circular ""searching"" animation)
2) flashes a search result for a split second & but will not display any search results

I have tested on a Note 4 running Marshmallow 6.0.1 & another Note 4 running Lollipop 5.1.1.  The issue was NOT present in OsmAnd+ 2.3.5.  Other users have also been able to replicate this issue on other devices as detailed in this thread:

[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/1dz9y6ivKr4](url)

The error is very easy to replicate & I have found a workaround however it clearly is not supposed to behave in this way:

1) Ensure online maps plugin is enabled
2) Search for street name & town under POI tab, example Haynes Way, Rugby then select Online Nominatim Address
3) OsmAnd will switch to search screen however **no search results will be displayed**
4) Delete town, eg Rugby
5) Search result is now displayed

Many other examples of error taken at random for testing:
Old Park Road, Telford
Corporation Street, Birmingham
Felspar Road, Tamworth
Jackdaw Lane, Oxford
The Hide, Milton Keynes
Nethergate, Dundee (Scotland)
Achenkamp, Bielefeld (Germany)

Strangely addresses in Sutton Coldfield produce search results:
Clarence Road, Sutton Coldfield
The Parade, Sutton Coldfield

Leamington Spa either produces or fails to produce a result depending on what is input:
Buckley Road, Leamington Spa = no search result, unless above method is used
Buckley Road, Royal Leamington Spa produces a search result

There appears to be some form of display bug which I hope you can please fix.

Thanks

But I accidentally selected the wrong favourite to replace. Now I don't know where that favourite used to be, and I'll never be able to find that place again (well, not really, but you get it).

There should be a confirmation dialog before a favourite gets replaced so this doesn't happen. Or at least a toaster message with an Undo button - but that could disappear if you are to slow.

The functionality is needed
-  if you want to view stops the transport line comes from
- or actually view stops in your direction of travel, because in some areas transport lines are mapped only once for both directions, so what we assume as ""stops **before**"" may actually be the very direction of travel the user needs.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Suggestion on Map Drawing-Rendering,[],"For trip planning, users frequently study maps by zooming in-out, touch-scrolling to nearby towns etc., just to get acknowledged to an area they want to go to.

Currently, when displaying a new area, OSMand first draws details, as streets and roads etc., and this can take time, especially on slow devices. Names (as town or street names) are appearing only after that drawing process has finished.

SUGGESTION: SIMPLY GET NAMES BEING DISPLAYED FIRST.

With names appearing first (for example, Boulevard St. Michel) the user knows immediately whether or not he zoomed or touch-scrolled to the area he was looking for.  If not, he can scroll further without waiting each time the whole drawing process finishes.  

I don’t know whether this is doable, but it looks easy and would really improve the user experience of OSMand.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Let user modify a route by dragging some interim points,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Google Maps inserts a few white points along the routes, which can be dragged to new positions, and the engine again finds the optimum route through them. These points are NOT interim destinations.

This is an intuitive way to modify the route.

But OsmAnd does not let us decide which way to go: It forces us to follow the calculated route only.
- The only solution is to add a few interim destinations. But then OsmAnd starts announcing them along the way. 
- A flag-point is supposed to be lighter than a waypoint, but when it is added as a interim destination, it loses its light character.
- The user can also use ""Avoid road"" feature, but usually OsmAnd tries to take a diversion around the spot. Thus the user may have to block several roads to coax OsmAnd to follow the desired route.

**Desired:**
Just allow the user to drag-n-drop any section of the route, as follows:
-  OsmAnd already has some maneuver points along the route, which are listed in the **Route details**.
- Normally OsmAnd does not show these points with a marker. But I suggest they should be marked with a circle/dot. 
- Allow the user to long-press on any of these points, and move the marker, using the standard ""Move the map to change the marker position"" GUI.
- Once the point is moved, let the algorithm re-calculate and complete the route.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Bug with writing or re-reading our own GPX route files,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","- Calculate a route with OsmAnd's offline router (take fixed start and end point to rule ot GPS fix variations)
- then save the route as GPX file
- then re-read the file again via ""route by GPX""
- then save again under a different name (2nd generation file)

The resulting 2nd generation route file significantly differs from the original one (different number of turn points, different distances between turns, turns in different locations, different time estimates between turns).

The differences are only in the rte section of the file, not in the trk section.

In the 2nd generation, not all points are shifted or newly introduced, some remain unchanged. Looks like upon re-reading an OsmAnd-router generated GPX file, some turns somehow get processed/consolidated: The originally saved file may e.g. contain 40 rtep points, the re-read-then-re-saved 2nd gen file may only have as few as 24.

Possibly also cross-connected to Issue #2874 (time/offset tagging also seems affected).

I may have induced this by fat fingering Live's 'Update now' the first time it was available to me, and making it download multiple times at once. It was sufficient to crash Osmand+.
1. Is it possible to click 'Update now' on a live map you've just subscribed to, multiple times, causing multiple downloads at once to commence and confuse the heck out of the server or client side?
2. In any event, if I have completely cleaned the app's storage and start with a new vector map, are we sure that 'Update now' means that the update process iterates from 'the oldest possible live update needed and goes in order up to the present, most recent update?

So the best workaround is to see them all on the map, and then make our choice.

But there are two problems here:
**Bug#1:** the button says ""Show cafe and restaurant on the map"". But it does not show **all** cafes and restaurants: It shows only the POIs that are there in the filtered list. Therefore it is more accurate if the button is labeled ""Show search results on map"", or if the text is omitted altogether, and replaced with an icon. The old icon (a point-marker on a half-folded map sheet) is good enough for this purpose.

 **Bug#2:** In the above case, OsmAnd shows only two POIs on screen. It should show all four results. In general, all the POIs in the filtered list must be shown on the map. The map must zoom and pan to show all results at once. The POI orange disks must be full size at that zoom.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Sometimes dies during navigation,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi guys, at the beginning I have to say this is the best issue template I've seen so far, good job on this.

My problem is that OsmAnd~ (from Fdroid) sometimes dies during navigation, when OsmAnd is in foreground.
Application just turns off, navigation is dead and I have to restart it, then I'm asked if I want to resume previous navigation. 
I didn't want to report it without log, so I was waiting for it to happen. Today it crashed again, and after restart it showed me popup `Send report`, which has never happened before.

Please give us the following information so that we can try to **reproduce** your issue:
Hard to say, I can't see any pattern when it crashes... Next time I use it I will turn on logging on logcat with filter for OsmAnd

What version of OsmAnd are you using, on what device and Android/iOS version?
- Android 4.1 branded from LG
- OsmAnd~ from Fdroid, version 2.3.5

Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps?
- Offline maps England and Wales
- Car navigation, non-default settings, don't think that matters, hide houses and borders, avoid motorways
- Enabled plugin: record GPS track automatically + continuous.

I tried to send report by email, but Fdroid crashes when doing it :D so I found exception.log in osmand folder (SD card), its content:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,How to mark a zebra crossing that involves a passage through the median also?,[],"The OSM [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcrossing) prescribes that to depict a zebra crossing, we have to insert a point on a road and tag it as **Highway=crossing**.

But I am not sure whether this fits the OsmAnd way of working:

In a typical zebra crossing, a pedestrian can cross from one side of the road to the other side of the road. 

But in OsmAnd, routes are not set like that: In the ""Walk"" mode, the route is not aligned to one side of the road to mimic a pedestrian walking on a footpath on one side of the road. Rather, OsmAnd shows a purple line right in the middle of the road (just like **Car** mode), as if the person is walking in the middle of a road. So IMHO when OsmAnd finds a POI on a road, with a **Highway=crossing** tag, it won't work. 

Secondly, this idea of inserting a dot does not work with a dual carriageway, because in OSM, both halves of the dual carriageway are shown separately, with a physical separation between them. In real world, this space could be just plain ground or a barrier (RCC slab, or a garden patch). In this context, a zebra crossing across a dual carriage means the median is cut there, to let the pedestrians cross it. That idea is better expressed with a link across the two halves and name it ""crossing"".

Well, I tried this method of mapping a zebra crossing ([link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=22/12.97302/77.61693)). But OsmAnd does not recognize it.

So the question is, how should we mark a zebra crossing across a dual carriageway, which cuts across the median as well?

This is not a bug. I was thinking that a 186 MB map of the World is really huge to download. This may be ridiculous but a truth in some countries like in Africa startinf from Algeria to South Africa.
Can we generate our own base maps ?

The aim is to have a lightweight basemap.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Offline routing crashes ungracefully in dense urban areas,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","OsmAnd: current nightlies, however the behaviour is the same for ages.
Nexus S, Android 4.1.2 unmodified/not rooted
Not using any custom routing.xml yet

While the FAQ says OsmAnd has limitations in calculating routes >250km, it seems to me it is more related to urban road density. While I have little problem calculating such route in a rural area or along a long motorway, it fails regularly for ""just"" driving across Berlin.

A route fully across Berlin, that is shown by air with 30-35 km, never succeeds. It calculates for several minutes and crashes the app. If I restart and drive on, it still crashes with air distances of 20 or 15 km, below that there is a chance that the remaining route is calculated, eventually. Less than 10km mostly succeeds. The blue progress bar goes quickly towards the end, stays there until the crash comes after 2-5 min. While calculating, the rest of the app remains functional, such as rendering, displaying position and speed; GPX is recorded, however the current street name is mostly missing.

It all depends on different on different parameters: if the route goes through the centre or more peripheral, if the phone is freshly booted or not, and if I killed some unrelated background-squatting  apps with the process monitor before starting OsmAnd.

In contrast to other crashes (such as recently in re-calculation getting ""android.speech.tts service not registered"" written to exceptions.log), the app does not write anything to the log, and crashes without restarting itself.

[It is known that the calculation is memory-intense](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/osmand/cZyB7AMeYlA/5UYfWsfdAAAJ), however I wonder if the remaining memory could be better monitored so it does fail gracefully instead of crashing.. 

I would find it also helpful to produce some debug information, both on screen and written into a separate log file, with details such as air distance, which routing phase we are in, how complex the road layout is being found, and how much memory is consumed in each step. The progress bar could indicate the routing phase, by changing colour or going backwards for phase 2.

My usecase is to have GPS track of a long trip without writing an continuous track to save battery and mark only an interesting points.
Favourites are more comfortable to use than GPX plugin, but they lack most of the info.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,The card of a new point is not an effective method of inserrting the point in a route,[],"Assume that we have already defined a route with a destination point.
Long-press anywhere on the map. OsmAnd places an orange spot-marker there, and shows a card.

The card has a blue button with a flag, which places the spot in different spots on the route. 

Ideally, we should be able to place the point anywhere on the route.
But it offers just four options, using very verbose and confusing options.

See the following chart, where I have shown the original route as a horizontal line with a start point, a destination point, and a few waypoints. The chart shows five different variations of this idea.

![insertion of a point in route](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9047168/17131448/26c270c6-533b-11e6-9e54-037a20e4fe99.png)
- All the possible insertion places are shown with an arrow.
- The **green** arrows show where OsmAnd allows us to insert the new point
- The **black** arrows show the places where we cannot insert the point.
- I have used **gray** arrows near the start point, because these are rarely used positions.

To conclude, the GUI provides as many as four options, and yet it cannot place the point in many useful places of the route. For example, it is not possible to replace an existing waypoint with this point, or place it between two existing waypoints. 

We will still need the **Route Editor** GUI to do this. In that case, why should we have four options in the card? After all, these are not most frequently used options!

**Desired:** The point's own card should have just one option: To insert the point in the route as a waypoint. After that, OsmAnd should automatically switch to the Route Editor, so that the user can place all points in proper sequence, or do the **door-to-door** sorting.

Yes - manifests in app's offline maps only. Does not manifest in online OsmAnd tiles.

- Set app language to Czech (either from device language or explicitly) and/or map rendering language is set to Czech (either from app language or explicitly)
- go to a viewport that contains multilanguage highway names (e.g. these streets, but seems to be general)
- the renderer picks an apparently random (first?) language tag for rendering the name, even though there is a `name` tag. **This is the bug.**
  ![osmand_cs_jecna](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/917239/17104290/855d76ee-5282-11e6-9524-7c11bce10e05.png)

See these streets for an example (both are in the viewport here)
- https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/335024354
  name=Lipová
  name:ru=    Липовая улица
- https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27299132
  name=Ke Karlovu
  name:de=Karlshof

Why is this wrong?
The Czech name is not similar to the German or Russian names, so the rendered map is highly confusing.

What should have happened?
The renderer should ""fall back to `name`"" (like when set to English), not ""randomly pick one from `name:*`, even though there isn't the right language"".
Compare the ""Ke Karlovu"" x ""Karlshof"" and ""Lipová"" x ""(something in Cyrillic)"" in screenshots.

This bug also does not appear in online tiles - the default `name` is used everywhere:

Perhaps interesting: scrolling/zooming the map forces a re-render, which _sometimes_ gets the names right, sometimes not. Note the top+bottom ""Karlovo náměstí""/""SФMЗTHIИG SФMЗTHIИG"", even though both highways are named the same:

The turn:lane recommendation is equally important as the navigation arrows. I need to know if the shown lane layout refers to the junction in front of me, or some distant one. Not all junctions have turn lanes painted, and not all painted lanes are in OSM yet. Thus I have junctions in between that look big, but have no recommendation in OsmAnd.

   You'll see the following entry: ""Von-Linde-Straße, Sandgrubensiedlung, Altenerding, Erding, Landkreis Erding, Upper Bavaria, Free State of Bavaria, 85435, Germany"", where ""Erding"" is the town and ""Altenerding"" the district.
2. While using offline maps search on Osmand for:

   - **City:** Erding
   - **Street:** Von-Linde-Straße
3. While also using offline maps search on Osmand for:
   - **Region:** Germany Bavaria
   - **City:** Altenerding
   - **Street:** Von-Linde-Straße
### Expected behaviour

Osmand should find the street wether you search for ""Erding"" or wether you search for ""Altenerding"".
### Actual behaviour

The street is only found when searching for ""Altenerding"". Which is very misleading because naturally you would search for Erding and all addresses I know only say ""Erding"", not ""Altenerding"". Erding is not a big city. OpenStreetMaps itself is able to find that street. why isn't Osmand able to?

3. No go back to the map screen and tap the new QuickSearch button. (No need to search anything, you can just leave again tapping ""back"")

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Better Strategy to Identify Turn Types,[],"![screenshot_20160721-152640](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9047168/17083567/1a26a89c-51c3-11e6-986e-c3b531132a71.png)
For the situation above, the best way to describe is to say ""Take a U-turn"". But OsmAnd says ""Take a right turn onto x road, and then right turn to y"". This is technically correct, but confusing.

![screenshot_20160721-101252](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9047168/17083577/50480a4c-51c3-11e6-916c-eb941882be94.png)
 This is best described as ""take a left turn"".
But in practice, OsmAnd says ""take a **slight** left turn"", based on the first segment only.

This is also another example of left turn, which is called ""slight"" left turn by OsmAnd.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Unable to reorder waypoints by dragging,[],"In version 2.3.4 I am able to reorder the waypoints by dragging the icon with the four horizontal bars. 
In version 2.3.5 this functionality doesn't work for me. I can only tick on the icon and move the waypoint up/down or remove it. Dragging the waypoints is much faster for me and therefore more convenient.

Steps how I create the route:
1. Select ""navigation arrow""
2. Select 'From:' - 'Favorite...' - pick favorite
3. Select 'To:' - 'Favorite...' - pick favorite
4 Scroll over the map, long press a road, select ""waypoint flag"" (the one in the blue circle) - 'Add as first intermediate destination' or 'Add as last intermediate destination'
5. Select ""navigation arrow"" - 'Via' (the ""orange waypoint flag""
6. Order waypoints in appropriate order by dragging the icon behind the waypoint (four horizontal bars) **<-- working in v.2.3.4, not working in v.2.3.5**

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OSM Live: enhancements (Update All button),[],"I'd like to propose a few enhancements for OSM Live. 
1. optional: Update on WiFi only and/or on power only

It would be nice if there were options for limiting live update to available WiFi connection and/or power supply but still be able to invoke it manually if necessary.
1. Update All button

If I feel the need to update my maps, I have to to it 16 times for each German state. I don't need that very often but it would be nice if there were a Update All button.
1. Update can't be stopped or paused

I'm often in regions with bad mobile reception. The update is supposed to start nightly but it seems that it starts in the morning. If I forget to stop it – which is only possible by killing the app from the android settings – it drains my battery and still doesn't update when the perception is bad. It would be great to be able to pause or skip the updates – even deactivating live update from osmand has no effect on an ongoing update.

And thanks for the great work.

1 - 
I open a pgx file (with wpt which include name and desc tags) with a file manager to start it with osmand.
Then Import it. Now I have favourites with name tag, but desc tag is lost.

2 -
I have a gpx file in dir import (or a subdir of import), same situation: file with wpt which include name and desc tags.
I use function ""GPX-track"" to open this file. This POI has name AND desc tag until now!

Be aware: favourites may have desc tags in osmand.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Different names of cities depending on use of regional or global map (offline maps),[],"Currently names of cities are displayed in local names on regional maps (zoomlevel >11) and names with display language (""my own language"") on global map.
For a lot of situations this is quiet good, but in some cases this different language is irritating.

When I am traveling I often use paper maps additional to osmand for orientation. On these paper maps all names are in the language of the mentioned country.
This differs from the names of osmand on zoomlevels when global map is displayed. I often can't find a city due to a very different name on the other (of these both) maps!

My suggestion:
Please add a new option flag with the content:
For global maps use local names (like in regional maps) instead of names in display language (which is default).

This would help very much.
Thanks Peter

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OsmAnd+ crashing since latest (July 1 2016) map update,[],"Hi. Since the latest monthly map update for England dated 1 July 2016 I'm seeing ""OsmAnd+ has stopped working"" error message every few minutes, often less.  OsmAnd+ did not crash when using the June maps prior to the July update.

The crash occurs either during navigation or driving in ""browse map"" mode with no destination set.  Others have reported crashes by simply manipulating the map.  The destination is irrelevant as the crash occurs regardless of the destination, however should you wish to test, the first route I observed crashes with the July map was from departure Lat 52.60085 Lon -1.68302 to destination Lat 52.47364 Lon -2.10563

I have run simultaneous side by side tests to the same destination using a Note 4 on 6.0.1 Marshmallow, a Note 4 on 5.1.1 Lollipop & a Galaxy Tab 3 on 4.4.2 Kitkat & OsmAnd crashed on all 3 devices.  All 3 devices were running OsmAnd+ 2.3.5

During the test process I also set a destination but remained at home & did not travel.  In this test OsmAnd+ remained stable on all devices & did not crash during the 30 minute test period.  The crash does however occur during a simulation using OsmAnd Development & Debugging plugin.

I have tried:
- Re-downloading maps
- Clearing app cache & data
- Uninstall/reinstall app
- Factory reset device & start from scratch

Please see this thread for further crash reports & additional information:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/QCsaE48ITRU

A user has also reported the same issue with Republic of Ireland map.  It seems potentially there is an issue with the maps whilst they are being compiled.

Thank you

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Routing through roads with tag barrier=toll_booth and ""avoid toll"" option",[],"Hello,

Lately I was driving through Czech Republic and on one section of the road there was a problem with routing. It told me to turn right instead of driving straight (longer distance). It turned out that the problem is the ""barrier"" tag on the road. When option ""avoid toll roads"" is unchecked then everything is OK. I attach screenshot with both variants. I think that Osmand ignores the toll=no option.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Suggestions for the new on-screen indexed search function,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Reporting for OsmAnd~17497M, running on Android M (actually OxygenOS 3.0.2)

I noticed some new features in the on-screen indexed search:
- much faster (results appear as we type) 
- allows us to specify the city/suburb to be searched (localized search)
- direct access from the screen, rather through menu.
- It has now become global search (not ""local"" search any more)

It's fantastic!

However, it can be improved even further:
1. Please add the ""show on map"" functionality, like the old search (I hope it is WIP already!)
2. Allow the user to long-press on some search-results and then show only those POIs on map. The map should zoom and pan enough to show all selected POIs at a time.
3. Allow user to enter the name of a city/suburb/locality only and browse the map.
   (He may not want to search for a specific POI by name, or search for POIs of a specified type)  
4. Make this new search available in the **Directions** dialog, so that the user can search for the POI and mark it as a waypoint/destination.

The same is true for mtb routes, but text alignment along winding paths often makes it unreadable. So may be rendering of mtb:names only on hi-scales (z16-17) is a partial solution (now mtb captions emerged even on z11 when only city names are displayed).

Since a few days ago map downloading in OSMAND on Android (version 2.3.5 from Play Store) is extremely slow. So slow in fact that it is impossible to download any larger map. I managed to download the world base map over night, but downloading Spain Cataluña for example (which is where I am located) is impossible. After many hours the download simply gets stuck at some random low percentage.

I tried two different Android devices and the wifi over which I am downloading is otherwise working just fine.

This is a severe problem as it makes an offline maps application completely useless if you can not download maps.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,"Major roads should be rendered from world basemap at z>11, but on special background","[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","From z12 and higher, world basemap data is not being rendered anymore. From reading #1777 I understand that this is intended. However it leads to a situation that when driving along a calculated route (for which worldmap data are considered) goes through a region that has no detail data loaded, the roads suddenly disappear, and a device fault is assumed. I understand that the basemap data might have a simplified geometry. 

I suggest one or more  of the following improvements:
- render major roads (and other available data) from worldmap in higher zooms, 
- render a special background pattern (warning colour, hatching, or even the words ""base map"") behind the roads
- render such special background only, as a warning to zoom back
- adjust the automatic zoom level to perform that zooming back automatically while driving.

In the screenshot below it is still obvious that you are running out of data, but in a higher zoom the map gets suddenly blank:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Incorrect maxspeed values,[],"Sometimes somebody in Iran adds incorrect maxspeed values like ""60.70.80.90"" or arabic letters. This breaks map creation of the whole country. After last live update process iteration we can't just regenerate map with new data. Map can be generated only during monthly generation process. We need to handle this situation and remove incorrect tags but don't let map creator crash.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Need Assistance Testing BT SCO Init under Android v4.2 and v4.3,[],"I need some quick support testing something on Android 4.2 and 4.3, but do not have any hardware actually running  these Android versions.

Maybe someone running Android 4.2 or 4.3 and using our nightly builds could run this quick test and report here?
- Use an OsmAnd nightly build dated 2016-07-13 or later
- On the device, activate Bluetooth (no need to connect to anything, but it should be on)
- In ""OsmAnd / Menu / Plugins"", enable the OsmAnd Development plugin (unless already enabled)
- In ""OsmAnd / General Settings / Voice guidance output"", select the 3rd option ""Phone call audio (also tries to interrupt car BT stereos)""
- In ""OsmAnd / Settings / OsmAnd development"", select the entry ""Test voice prompts""
- On the language selection dialog, select ""en-tts""
- Scroll down and tap the very last button (11.1) at the bottom of the screen

You should see a toast message on screen. I would need to know if the toast looks like what I framed in red on the screenshot attached, or if you see any ""NO"" with additional detail?

After the test, please disable the Dev plugin, and revert your selection of ""Voice guidance output"" (Media is the default) and the language selection under ""General Settings / Voice guidance"" to your needs.

Thanks, much appreciated! - Hardy

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,BT audio output does not work correctly after route recalculation,[],"While testing the new feature in the nightly to pass BT audio via SCO ( #2590 ) I have encountered a bug
- Driving normally the feature works as expected
- When one deviates from the route and osmand has to recalculate the route a message starts to play, but the bluetooth channel is interrupted after 1second.
- After that the audio output is not working anymore.

Assumptions:
Sometimes there is some audio output over BT, for example when the audio message is long enough. Most of the message is truncated however and you only hear the last couple of seconds of it. I assume the message lenght from the interrupted route recalculation message is stil stuck in a handler, and when calculating the current output signal shorter messages can't anymore get through. Restart of route, app or BT does not help.

Remark: First time I have encountered this I tried to turn off BT and on again, but the BT slider on the phone got frozen (slider in on position, but disabled) After trying to restart the phone I got stuck in an optimize apps loop and had to wipe all data to get back into android UI.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,OSM Live shows incorrect update size,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Using OsmAnd~2.4.0#17414
In the **Live Updates** tab, there is a **Live Updates** switch.
Tapping on the label of this switch shows a list of status for the downloaded maps.

If we tap on any one region, another card pops up to show the live update status.  
This card shows the update size. For India map, this is always 8 -11 MB, even if I update the map manually several times a day. However, the actual download is over so fast that I am sure that it must be a few kB only.

In other words, I suspect that the update size shown in this card is wrong. **[BUG-1]**

BTW a manual update should reset the update size to zero. But this does not happen. **[BUG-2]**

To confirm this, immediately after doing a manual update, I edited OSM and added a few POIs (using OsmAnd and ID editor). These changes cannot be more than a few bytes. Yet the update size is still at 8 MB.

Considering that the entire country map is only 500 MB, the daily updates of 8-11 MB sound excessive! At this rate the India map would exceed 1 GB size in a few weeks!

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Bugs and suggestions for the POI-Editor dialog,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","**Suggestion-1:**
In the **Advanced** tab, OsmAnd lists _all_ tags (and _only_ tags).
So this tab should be named ""Tags"".

**BUG-1:**
In the **Advanced** tab, OsmAnd lists each tag and its value in white boxes.
If I add a new attribute, it shows tag+values pair (e.g. ""shoes:women"") in **Tag** field, and the **Value** field is left blank. This leaves the user under wrong impression that the value of the tag is not set yet.
**Desired:** The ""tag:value"" pair should be split and populated in their respective fields.

**BUG-2:**
If I tap on the **Cancel** button, OsmAnd pops up a dialog:

**Are you sure?**
Any unsaved changes will be lost. Continue? 
Cancel     OK

The user may be confused when he sees two ""cancel""s consecutively. 
- What does ""Cancel"" actually mean: Cancel the previous cancel, or cancel the POI-editing?
- What does ""continue"" mean: Continue editing, or continue on your way out?

**Solution:** Instead of ""Cancel/OK"" buttons, show ""Return to POI / Quit"".

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Search Sometimes Slow When Returning to the Search Screen via BACK,[],"I have been watching this for a while but am not yet sure how to reliably re-produce:
- Go to Menu/Search/POI, tap on any category.
- The search results will start to be displayed really fast (mostly instantaneous).
- Now tap on one of the search hits: It will get indicated on the map, and its context menu will popup.
- Now tap the device's (hardware) BACK button (a frequent use case!) twice: First tap will hide the context menu again, second tap will bring you back to the Search/POI/category screen.

Now, even though this is the very same screen which initially swiftly produced search results, sometimes (often) this screen will remain with the spinner on and not display any results for about 15 sec or so. 

It feels like either there is no list adapter refresh displayed for a long time, or there is still a previous async task running and the system first waits for its termination. The latter seems unlikely, as this is similar to #2657, and there I had already introduced the fix to terminate the Async search task in  onDestroy(). That fixed #2657, but the issue I describe here remains.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Speed cameras not working since OsmAnd 2.3,[],"Version: Osmand Plus 2.3.x on Android (tried all 2.3.x, included nightly builds)

Offline maps used: official italy-emilia-romagna.obf and unofficial maps made with OsmAndMapCreator of the same area

Point of the map: all speed cameras mapped off road in an enforcement relation, i.e. http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=44.84957&mlon=11.56487#map=19/44.84957/11.56487

Routing used: OsmAnd in-app offline routing (any route passing for those points)
Routing profile used: car

Enabled options: show speed cameras, speed cameras alert

Since OsmAnd shifted from 2.2 to 2.3, **speed cameras mapped as off road nodes into an enforcement=speed_camera relation** (classic three points role=from,device,to where the speed camera is ""device"") don't generate an alert any more. An icon, neither.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,OSM Live feature: Update reporting is faulty ,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I am using OsmAnd ~2.4.0#17407M, on OnePlus 2 running OxygenOs 3.0.2 (which in turn is based on Android M 6.0.1).

I have enabled **OSM Live (beta)** feature.

I observed two different problems:

**Case-1:**
Last map change: Jul 9, 2016 10:30 PM
Last map update: Jul 10, 2016 5:30 AM
(The time stamps are approximate, as I remember)

I selected **Update Now**, OSmAnd downloaded two files.
**BUG-1** If the last update of the map was done after the last change to the map, why did OsmAnd update the map at all? 

**Case-2:**
Last map change: Jul 10, 2016 5:30 AM
Last map update: Jul 10, 2016 8:49 AM
Update size: 13.3 MB

(This data is accurately reproduced from my screen)
I selected **Update Now**, OSmAnd did not download any files.

**BUG-2** From the report, it is obvious that the last update was done after last edit to OSM, my device already has the latest OSM. Then why does OsmAnd show 13.3 MB update?? Also, if it really has that much data to download, why does it not download it when I select **Update now**? 

---

**BUG-3:** If I tap on the **Live Updates** label, OsmAnd pops up a card that shows the latest report for India. This is a hidden functionality (easter egg). Most users will not even realize that this functionality exists. It should not be hidden.

---

**Desired:** If OsmAnd has updated the local obf file with the latest version of OSM, and there are no more edits to be copied down, OsmAnd should disable (gray out) the **Update Now** button.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Difficult to use map markers in a journey,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","We have already a closed issue about naming the flags. The wisdom is that if naming is allowed, then there is no difference between a Favorite and a flag.

That's good logic. 

But the remaining logic is not compatible with this logic.

I think the best application of flag markers is to plan a rapid-fire trip.
So imagine a few flags are already planted on the map.
1. When we tap on each flag, the context menu is too big+complex. We don't need a choice of last/first destination points, destination, etc. We already have a waypoint editor for that, where the user can do the same thing visually, and fast. The context menu should simply add the waypoint.
2. In many cases, OsmAnd cannot resolve the address. In that case, the spot is known as ""No address determined"". If you have >2 flags like this, the whole purpose is defeated! Which is which??
3. The original flag color is shown only on map, but not in the **Destinations** dialog. This is a major bummer. For example, the Destinations dialog shows them all as orange flags. The quick identity is lost.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Usability: Simplify our Route Setup (once again),"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","OsmAnd recently came out 5th place of 5 tested free smartphone navigation apps in a big computer magazine. When scanning their results, it seems this is almost entirely due to what they call ""awkward usability"".

I have discussed this with a colleague, and the findings are as follows:

(1) On the ""Route setup"" screen,  after ""From:"" and ""To:"" are selected, there is no obvious way for a user to add intermediate destinations. google maps e.g. offers an obvious ""+"" sign to enter more destinations.

(2) On the ""Route Setup"" screen, we fork to a second screen ""Waypoints"" via the ""flag"" button. Only this second screen offers basic functionality like changing the order of destinations. We strongly believe these 2 screens need to be collapsed to one screen, combining their functionality.

(3)  On the ""Route Setup"" screen, we are still missing functionality when selecting or changing the ""From:"" or ""To:"" locations (future also ""Via:""): The pull-down menu offers to select from Favorites, Select on map, or Address search, but we should offer **all** search mechanisms.

(4) Our map screen is missing a ""Search"" button: The **primary functionality** of a navigation app is hiding behind menus or other clicks and taps!

Looks like with these measures we could align our UI with what most users seem to expect and how other apps conventionally offer it, while still preserving our wealth of functionality (which is often superior to other's.)

"
osmandapp/Osmand,open,Enable synchronisation of favourites,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","(This request resembles #1613 but the export/import from that issue would not be sufficient)

This request: please make it possible to synchronize favorites among devices. This is not a request to implement the synchronization itself - I can understand that it is impossible for Osmand to support all possible solutions (external SD card, DropBox, OneDrive, Google Drive...). But the way Osmand handles favorites at the moment makes it very cumbersome to perform any form of synchronization, even with a third-party app. The request is to modify the Osmand behaviour to allow for easy synchronisation, and preferably allow automated synchronisation (e.g., via a third-party app).

Some background: I'm a huge fan of Osmand and I'm using it extensively on holidays. It's great to have an offline map/navigation app. I use the favourites a lot to mark the location of hotels, train stations and other points that I want to visit, have to change trains or buses etc. Especially in countries where you cannot read or understand the local language, having a map  that tells you whether you are close to your target is very practical. So while traveling I tend to add, move, remove and rename favorites a lot.

I'm using Osmand on two or three devices (tablet, new phone for safe areas, old phone as backup and for less secure areas), more or less at the same time. The tablet is great for planning itineraries, the phones for navigation and ad-hoc route planning, and the tablet is also a backup in case the battery of the phone is empty. But then it should be easy to distribute changes to the favourites made on one device to the other two.

With the current Osmand version that is impossible, or at least it is a nightmare.

Exporting the favourites is possible. Go to the list of favourites and use the share option to export the file. It is possible to save the favourites.gpx to Dropbox, or to save the file to an external location (memory card/USB stick that is connected via USB). (It is not possible (on Android 5.x) to save the favourites to a file on the internal/external SD card, probably because of security issues).

The main problem is importing the favourites, because Osmand always prefers the data on favourites that is stored in its internal database. There are several ways to import the favourites.gpx:
- Double-click the .gpx file. Osmand is one of the options to open the file, the select the option to import the file. This will import all favourites from the file, but the favourites already present will not be deleted or modified. You've got most of the favourites twice; only new or renamed favourites are present only onces, as are the favourites you wanted to get rid of. This is not the solution.
- You can delete all favourites first. That's a bit of a nightmare, as you have to be very sure that you do not throw away any modifications that were not yet present on the other device. Then double click the .gpx file and import it. All favourites are present in the correct categories, but the colors associated with the categories are lost. This is not the solution.
- Copy the .gpx file in the files directory of Osmand, force Osmand to stop, restart Osmand. Now all new favourites are present, but the existing ones are still present and they do not get updated as Osmand ignores the data for those in the .gpx file.This is not the solution.
- Delete all favourites, save the .gpx file in the Osmand files directory, force Osmand to stop restart Osmand. This works!

The last one works, but it is quite cumbersome and there's plenty of room for error.

Personally, I would prefer a third-party app solution: create an app that synchronizes two versions of a favourites.gpx (allowing for changes in both versions), and updating the collection of favourites in Osmand. (I could make such an app, I've built similar software.) Such an app could automate the process, but... Osmand won't allow that. If only _all_ favourites were writen to the favourites.gpx, then such an app could read the data without user intervention. If only Osmand would (have an option to) use the data from the _external_ (favourites.gpx) file if it exists instead of from the internal data file, then modifications could be communicated automatically to Osmand. If only there was a way (e.g., via the Osmand api) to _reinitialise_ the favourites from the external data, then such an app could do its work without the user having to force Osmand to stop.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Feature request: traveler mode plugin,[],"When you travel for a long distance (especially with bicycle) you need to know where you can find some amenities along the road, such as:
hotels\motels\campings,
bus\train stations (long-distance tickets),
road cafes,
groceries shops,
water wells\springs\water taps.
Normally you don't need to see them, because in cities there are lots of them and usually it is better to see them only in the close view (as it is now).
But while travelling, it would be really useful to see those things enlarged, so, probably for this purposes it would be nice to have special mode in osmand, named probably ""traveler mode"" or something in main program or in external plugin (preferable).

- The speed limit should be that of the road currently driven.

I don't know how the lanes view is implemented, but I guess this is a very quick fix, right?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,New roundabout navigation looks weird on 4th exit,[],"2.4.0#17177M 231 OsmAnd-master-nb-2016-06-23.apk (morning) / screenshots in live traffic

The roundabout drawing looks weird when it recommends the 4th exit, like bouncing off the middle.
3rd exit looks better, but misses the fact that the roundabout has 5 arms. The recommended exit number is correct. Maybe you draw the arrow with an angel >360 deg?

Situation shown is [this roundabout](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.51262&mlon=13.32193#map=18/52.51262/13.32193), routing towards Bismarckstr, coming from Hardenbergstr in the first and from Std.d.17. Juni in the second case. 

Another issue is this recommendation for the 1st exit, which in reality is about 90 degrees to the right, shown as going straight over. The junction also has 5 arms as the previous roundabout.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Updating french ""GPS signal lost/restored""",[],"Hi,

The french TTS voice for GPS signal lost/restored is a bit flaky : for lost signal, the voice says ""Signal GP S restauré"", with a noticeable pause between ""P"" and ""S"" which sounds very awkward.

Also, GPS is only one of several positionning systems, along with GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo (in the future), and also an indian one whose names escapes me at the moment, so speaking about ""GPS signal"" may well be milsleading or inaccurate. GPS is NOT a synonym with ""satellite positionning"". It's merely one of several systems

I hence suggest rephrasing to :
- ""Satellite positionning lost"" (fr : ""Position/localisation/emplacement par satellite perdue"")
- ""Satellite positionning restored"" (fr : ""Position par satellite retrouvée"")

Also, what about the future, when precise location (as opposed to Android's ""coarse location"") will be accessible via extensive wifi/Bluetooth mapping and won't require satellites ? Why not go even further and rephrase to :
- ""Position lost"" (fr : ""Position perdue"")
- ""Position restored"" (fr : ""Position retrouvée"")

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Search > Location, add formats: ""DDD.DD,DDD.DD"" and Open Location Code","[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Under ""Search > Location > Format"", it would be good to add ""DDD.DD,DDD.DD"", so that numbers in that format can be entered. It works for example on google maps, and often coordinates are given like that. I've found that I have a coordinate ""DDD.DD,DDD.DD"" on the clipboard, and then need to split it, to fit into the dual ""DDD.DD"" boxes.

The second format I'd like to suggest is the ""Open Location Code"", a relatively recently developed ""postcode-like"" encoding for coordinates, see http://openlocationcode.com/. I guess the format isn't widely used, but it was developed by Google Zurich, and Google Maps does support it. The code to go to/from Open Location Code is available here https://github.com/google/open-location-code/tree/master/js/src and is easy to adapt. In my opinion, it would be good to support.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,Enable automatic night mode when in a tunnel,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Day mode can be rather bright in tunnels. I suggest adding an option to the Map Mode menu (Day, Night, Sunrise/Sunset and Light sensor) to enable night mode when in a tunnel. This feature is present in other navigation apps, e.g. IGo.

Before you suggest just using the light sensor for this, there are two problems:
1. Not all devices have light sensors (e.g., in-car head units with Android - I have installed OsmAnd there and am currently experimenting with using OsmAnd as my main in-car navigation app).
2. The light sensor threshold is not adjustable, and frequently it shifts to night mode even in bright daylight, when e.g. driving through a heavily forested area (where the ambient light is still bright enough that night mode poses a problem).

Using tunnel detection outside navigation might require enabling ""snap to road"" functionality outside navigation.

Currently using OsmAnd 2.3.5 (though point 2 above, the light sensor complaint, comes from an earlier version - I haven't tested that in a while.)

I suggest adding an option to the voice guidance settings:

```
Disable alert on GPS Signal lost/restored

```

The ""In tunnel"" option would mute the ""GPS signal lost"" if it occurs inside a tunnel or some seconds after exiting a tunnel. Furthermore, if the GPS signal has been lost in a tunnel, the subsequent ""GPS signal restored"" message should also be muted.

The ""Always"" option should be self-explanatory.

_Wait!!! shouts the Cerebrum [2]. This is just the navigation screen, the traffic lights are still red! Stop!_

Honestly, I had the temptation to drive on a couple of times while checking the _turn_ or _turn:lane_ indicators, and seeing the yellow-green transition. In the nightlies a few weeks ago, the indicators changed from yellow to orange, and I liked that a lot more. Any other colour would also do (blue for example), except green.

The [Cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum) (""little brain"") is responsible for sub-concious planning and trained motion patterns. Responding to traffic lights is certainly such a trained pattern.
In the [Cerebrum](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum) (""major brain""), the concious actions are planned, judged and performed.

In OSMAND, at least when you're online, there should be a simple option to type, search, and find. One issue is that as soon as you type into the search box, you're presented with 
""Search by name""
""Online Nominatim - Places""
""Online Nominatim - Address""
and it's not clear what these do (to the non-expert).

Another issue is that even after searching in OSMAND, you still have to tap ""find more"" to find results. If you search (e.g.) for a major capital city, that doesn't really make sense.

Clearly, the ""POIs search"" (partially a ""browse"") is very helpful, as are ""address"", ""location"", ""favourite"", ""history"". Maybe a ""help screen"" could be added in the short term, to help users find their way?

For example: at high zoom levels the roads disappears in the Osmand from repository. (32.11609;34.79337) This LatLon is not the same as the screenshots but in that point you can see the same problem.

OSMand from repository:

I remember scratching my head twice about how to save a favorite. The second time I remembered there was some trick to it, but could not remember what it was. Anecdotally, I also did a quick usability test and showed the screen to two friends and asked them how to save the favorite. Neither of them noticed the Save button. One of them eventually suggested a Done button in the keyboard, which does not save the favorite. The other one would have tried ""Replace"" (which doesn't look much like a button either).

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,More flexible/different freemium model,[],"I am a happy noob contributor to a few FOSS projects via translations, minor changes, feedback and such. In those situations I'm happy to donate, but don't really like it to be forced.

One of those projects is OSM in combination with OsmAnd. I'd be happy to also provide a monetary contribution, but the current system forces you in  nasty way: OsmAnd has a max of 7 downloads. When it's done it's done, and so I have a few remarks around this:

1) How does the live updates subscription work together with limited downloads? (I suspect this limitation is lifted, but there's no info on the main pages)

2) The total lifetime max of 7 updates renders the free app somewhat pointless in a year or two (in regular use, could be 0,5 if you're an active OSM contributor). I would rather see an open source project takes a little more flexible freemium model:
- rather than having a lifetime maximum of 7 downloads, have:
- maximum number of _simultaneously installed maps_ (eg maximum one region at a time, the world overview map excluded), and/or
- maximum number of _downloads per timeframe_ (say max 1/2 download(s) per year)

3) To at least give users a warning before deleting a map in case they have no downloads left (#2691)

_I started to think about this when I deleted a map to afterwards download it again, so that I could check if the latest version of a map still had some particular errors or not in navigation. I thought I was contributing to the project, but it felt like being punished for it. What I'm hoping for is an open discussion here following this experience._

However, if the measurement unit is changed in the ""General settings"" (e.g from kilometres/metres to miles/feet), the elevation unit here changes immediately but the speed unit does not.  The speed is still displayed in the old unit even after returning to the home screen and back to OsmAnd.  The only way to get the speed displayed in the correct units is to kill and restart the OsmAnd app.

This happens whichever way the unit is changed, whether by an explict choice from the ""Unit of measure"" option, or implied from the ""Driving region"".

osmandapp/Osmand,open,can't use NLP to update location while navigation route is active,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","The GPS on my Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini (G800H) does not work (this device is known to have hardware issues with the GPS), so I was hoping I could use UnifiedNLP with Mozilla Location Service to get updated positions via WiFi. I live in a large city with tons of WiFi networks everywhere, so I think this could be practical.

In CyanogenMod's locations settings I have ""Battery saving"" (WiFi and mobile networks only, no GPS) mode selected, but OsmAnd doesn't respect this while navigation is active. I can calculate a route using my currently location as a waypoint using UnifiedNLP, but OsmAnd displays a warning that says ""The background navigation service requires a location provider to be turned on."" Thereafter, OsmAnd only attempts to use my broken GPS, but not UnifiedNLP. While the route is active, pressing the crosshair in the bottom right of the screen doesn't work, but it does after the route is dismissed. Auto centering the map doesn't work either. It would be nice if OsmAnd would respect the OS' location setting, at least when pressing the crosshair button, if not for automatically updating position while moving too. It would also be nice if there was an option to limit how often an updated location is requested while navigating to limit battery and data usage.

osmandapp/Osmand,open,feature request: caching rendered tiles,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","There is a substantial discrepancy in how long it takes to show different areas when moving the map around using prerendered tiles versus vector data as the main map source. Downloading tiles for an area and configuring them as the underlay alleviates the issue of seeing large gray patches when moving the map quickly. But it is still annoying to have to wait for my phone to render every time to have the map show all features in the ways I have configured for my personal preferences.

I think the user experience could be improved by adding an option to cache tiles rendered from vector data. There could be options to limit the size of the cache or how long tiles are kept in cache. The cache would automatically be cleared when the user changes any option in the ""Configure map"" menu that affects how the map is displayed. It may also be helpful to be able to render tiles for an area in batches using a similar UI to that used for downloading tiles (a menu item that appears when tapping a point on the map and pressing the ""..."" icon) within OsmAnd without requiring the use of the Map Creator tool on a separate device (which also doesn't offer the same options as OsmAnd).

This seems to occur for all beanshell map sources.

The core issue seems to be inside beanshell - for some reason, variables can't be evaluated.  Eg. the following code would fail:

String a = ""foo"";  // succeeds
String b = a;  // fails

However methods can be invoked:
String b = a.concat("""");  // succeeds

Variables can be defined with a value, but not reassigned.
String a = ""foo"";  // succeeds
a = ""foo"";  // fails

I suspect the proguard config might be breaking beanshell, but I have no leads how.

I was hoping to be able to at least fix the defaults to work with the broken beanshell, but I'm not sure it's possible.

Ideas welcome.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Adding new GPX waypoint takes too many taps,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi all, 
first off, thank you very much for Osmand, it's very good!

Often, I use Osmand to record a gpx track and information about things that I want to add to the OSM database later with JOSM. Sometimes I take a photo or audio note, but often I want to write a short note to myself. For this, I use gpx waypoints. Since the interface updates, the procedure to add a gpx waypoint has gotten more complicated:
1. long-tap at the desired location (not always my current position)
2. tap the three dots on the bottom right
3. tap ""add GPX waypoint""
4. tap the last field (note?)
5. tap ""save""
6. tap screen again to see the whole map

I believe only step 2 has been added, but maybe also the 6th step was not necessary before?

Would it be possible to speed up that procedure somehow? 

Unfortunately I can't think of a good solution: expanding the A/V-notes widget would only make it quicker for the current location. 

Maybe allow customizing the pop-up that appears on long-tap? Having a ""mapper preset"" to show the most important buttons for mappers, or a fully customizable mode, that lets people choose what will be in the pop-up?

"
osmandapp/Osmand,open,"Usbility issues with the ""POIs along the route"" workflow","[Label(name=""Observed"")]","There are several usability issues with the **POIs along the route** workflow.

**Problems in the planning phase:**
1. **Often it is impossible to reach the POIs on the other side of the road:** When driving on a major highway (or a city road), there are no median breaks. If we want to reach a POI on the other side of the road, you have to drive several km, find a U-turn (or a flyover), and come back. After visiting the POI, the driver has to go several km in the reverse direction to find a U-turn. It may not be worth going through this large loop: You may get many more POIs on your own side of the road. Therefore, there should be an option to ignore the POIs on the opposite side of the road. 
2. OsmAnd presents a list of POIs along the way. If you tap on any of those POIs, OsmAnd switches to the map mode, auto-centers the map on that POI and shows a marker there. Now we can add that point as a waypoint. This is a nice feature. But it assumes that you will do it only once: If you go back to the list and tap on another POI, OsmAnd fails to auto-center the map on it. You have to pan the map manually to look for that spot.
3. In the POI list, the second line of any POI shows the distance from origin and offset from route. And there is also a nice icon that shows the direction (left/right). Instead of keeping it gray, can we have it color-coded? (left=red, right=green, as in the lighting code used in ships/aircraft). This will help us focus on the POIs that are on the desired side of the road.
4. When this icon was not there, the offset was a signed number (+ means right, - means left). But this icon shows us the direction, so the +/- signs are not needed. Remove them.

**Problems in the navigation phase:**
1. During navigation, the next upcoming POI is displayed at the top of the screen. But this list does not show direction icon (left/right). OsmAnd should show this icon, so that the driver looks out in the correct direction.
2. When the POIs are close together, the audio announcement is too chatty, This can be reduced to a comfortable level and made human-like, like this:
   
   2a. The announcement says ""Poy restaurant xxx"" (it cannot pronounce the three separate letters in ""POI""). This is annoying. In fact, we don't need to hear this prefix ""poy"" for each POI. So drop it.
   
   2b. The audio announcement is not in sync with the way we think: If we can see a spot through our windshield, we say it is ""up ahead"". If we can see it through the front windows of the car, we say ""it is passing"". If we can see it through the rear windows of the car, we say ""it has passed"". But OsmAnd says ""passing poy <name>"" even it is ""up ahead"". Generally, when we are driving a car at speed, a ""passing"" spot is as good as gone: We generally let it go and focus on the next one. So OsmAnd should give us correct cues.
   
   2c. It is illogical to say ""continue for 300m to pass poy xxxx"". Instead, say ""xxxx is 300m ahead, on left"". It is short and sweet; and includes the direction, so we can look out in the right direction.
   
   2d. At present, OsmAnd allows us to list POIs of only one type. Thus there is no point in announcing the same type for each POI repetitively: It just increases the word-count of the announcement, and slows it down (especially when several POIs are announced together).
   
   2e. Often several POIs are located close to each other. If the car is traveling fast, we may reach multiple POIs together. In such cases, announce them together. For example, ""McDonalds, KFC and Barista coming up."" Or just mention the count ""Four restaurants ahead"". (The driver may want to slow down and make his choice.)
   
   2f.  When we are driving along the route, we may want to see which POIs are available next. But OsmAnd does not help us here: Its POI list shows the whole list of POIs along the entire route, from start to finish. It is impossible to tell which POIs have ""fallen behind"". Just like how OsmAnd shows the purple line only for the remaining route, it should show POIs only for the remaining route.  
3. Often the driver cannot simply turn off the road to reach the suggested POI: He has to take a certain lane. But when he is driving, he does not have the time to figure this out. Therefore OsmAnd should manage this navigation to POI: If the driver selects a POI (by tapping on the top of screen), OsmAnd should instantly re-route to that POI.

But often I would like to have the possibility to show the vector map's lines (streets), points (pois) and labels at the highest layer overlaying even the overlayer map.
Is it possible to use a layer configuration like (top) vector map's streets, pois and labels, (mid) transparent raster map and (bottom) vector map's polygons or underlay raster map?
If no, would it be an idea to introduce a middle layer for raster maps shown underlaying the vector map's lines, points, labels but overlaying the polygons?
In total Osmand would provide the following layers:
1. Overlay map,

Or to introduce (b) a menu button close to the refresh and search button (top right corner) in the Manage map files menu leading to the same results by filtering the available maps (like when using the search function to search for the region/country of interest).
This would easily help to identify which maps are required to download and would provide a quick access to the available maps for the current region/country of interest.

This is essentially created by doing e.g. a ""Search by name"" over a large area. It looks like after OsmAmd at one point had to perform such a ""very big search"", search performance for all subsequent searches can be extremely affected, and then even things which normally took only seconds to show up, like a POI/Wikipedia search with 1km radius, or even just showing the initial  ""big city list"" after tapping a region in the address list screen, can take like 3-5 minutes to pull up (before that just showing an empty list and the spinner).

As the node has no address information attached to it (some intelligent OSM users removed these), OsmAnd tries to derive the address, and arrives at ""Barfüßerstraße 10"". This however is grossly incorrect, and there is an easier way to determine it, since the shoe store node is part of a way (technically ""one or more ways…"") which have addr:\* tags, such as way 50223573.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Poor routing with ""Shortest way"" enabled","[Label(name=""Offline Routing"")]","OsmAnd appears to make poor routing choices when using Shortest Way.  I've noticed this on several occasions, but I wanted to wait until I had a very clear example to use.
- OsmAnd release version 2.3.5 (2016-04-28) and many nightly builds, including 2.4.0#16999M (2016-06-02)
- Android 5.0 on Samsung Galaxy S5, and Android 6.0.1 on Samsung Galaxy S7
- Using OsmAnd's offline maps.  On the S5, the United States Georgia April 30, 2016 map.  On the S7, the United States Georgia April 30, 2016 map with the latest Live updates.

Problem occurs with both Car and Bike profiles.  (Pedestrian profile routes correctly.)

Steps to reproduce:

For the Start and End points, I select the hamlet Henderson, Georgia http://osm.org/go/ZHF91YmU-?node=154364175 and the city Vienna, Georgia http://osm.org/go/ZHFsjbyI-?relation=119829.  I've tried it routing in both directions.  For my testing, I did not bother to select a street, I just used the town nodes.

For routing options, I begin with all of them unselected (i.e., none of the ""avoid"" settings selected, and I use Fastest way instead of Shortest way).

For Car profile, results are as expected:
OsmAnd routes me to the nearby freeway I 75, along it, and then off at an appropriate exit to reach my destination, about 20 miles.

For Bike profile, results are as expected:
OsmAnd routes me along primary road US 41/GA 7, about 19.5 miles.

Next, enable the Avoid Motorways setting.  OsmAnd recalculates the route.

For Car profile, results are as expected:
OsmAnd routes me along US 41/GA 7, about 19.5 miles.

For Bike profile, results are as expected:
OsmAnd routes me along US 41/GA 7, about 19.5 miles.

Next, enable the Shortest Way setting.  (You can do this with or without Avoid Motorways enabled.  The results are the same.)  OsmAnd recalculates the route.

For Car profile, results are NOT as expected:
OsmAnd routes me along US 41/GA 7, which is not the shortest route.  It _should_ route me along US 41 until it reaches Old National Highway/Old Vienna Road (depending on which direction you're going), then along that route, until it reaches US 41 again, about 17.4 miles.

For Bike profile, results are NOT as expected:
OsmAnd routes me along US 41/GA 7, which is not the shortest route.  It _should_ route me along US 41 until it reaches Old National Highway/Old Vienna Road (depending on which direction you're going), then along that route, until it reaches US 41 again, about 17.4 miles.

Pedestrian profile _does_ use Old National Highway/Old Vienna Road in the route.  Simply select it to see the route I expected the Car and Bike proflies to use.

I will note that in the current US Georgia map file, Old National Highway and Old Vienna Road are classified as Residential, with no road surface or maxspeed tags.  I recently drove that route to capture data about it, and I'm using that information to update OSM (in progress).  Even so, I would expect the Shortest Way option to choose that route without my updates.

1. Have OsmAnd running, started via its shortcut in ""All apps"" (or a shortcut you may have on the home screen).
2. Switch to some other app, e.g. an SMS, where you tap a location (e.g. google maps or osmand.net) URL, and select OsmAnd to perform the ""Open URL"" action. -> OsmAnd pops up and correctly displays the location.
   3.Now tap the home button to put OsmAnd (or should I say: this instance of OsmAnd?)  in the background 
3. Go to ""All apps"" (or use an OsmAnd shortcut on your home screen) to return to OsmAnd.

The instance of OsmAnd you are looking at now behaves weird:
(a) Long-tapping on arbitrary locations on the map produces the orange marker, but no context menu pops up. 
(b) Tapping the orange marker itself does not produce a context menu
(c) Going to search, searching something, then selecting a search hit returns to the map, but still displays the last orange maker. Map does neither pan the map to the location of the search hit, nor mark it, nor produce its context menu.
(d) Same as (c) for e.g. going to favorites
(e) Sometimes: The Search/POI tab will show all pre-defined search categories duplicated, tripled, etc. (I think an additional set is added for each time a new OsmAnd instance is started via the URL method.)

I think we end up in a situation here where there are 2 instances of OsmAnd somehow ""overlapping"". Killing OsmAnd in the task manger remediates the situation. Tapping the Back key often enough to put you on the home screen, then tapping an OsmAnd shortcut there remediates the situation, too.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Easier on/off switching of POI,[],"The process of switching POIs on/off currently involves more steps than switching ""underlay map"". The suggest is to make POI display the same as (e.g. for) ""underlay map"".

Explanation: To switch POIs on, these steps are required:
1. Tap configure map
2. Tap POIs
3. Potentially scroll
4. Tap OK.

If POIs are switched off, and back on, the complete process needs to be repeated, making it hard to switch POIs on/off easily.

By contrast, e.g. for underlay ""underlap map"", the underlay map itself is remembered, and can be switched on/off (tapping on the right) without needing to re-select the map (which can be done by tapping on the left). The process should be the same for POIs.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Fix confusing ""Configure map"" interaction between ""World/Car/Bike/Walk""","[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","The current ""configure map"" options have confusing interaction between ""World/Car/Bike/Walk"". The rule seems to be the first menu item under ""Show"" doesn't depend on ""World/Car/Bike/Walk"", while the other two sections ""Map rendering""  and ""Other..."" depend on  ""World/Car/Bike/Walk"" as follows: if a setting in ""Car/Bike/Walk"" has never been altered, and the setting in changed in World, the corresponding setting in ""Car/Bike/Walk"" also changes. If the setting in ""Car/Bike/Walk"" has been altered, it's independent of World. This is confusing.

My suggestions would be to make all ""Configure map"" settings specific to ""World/Car/Bike/Walk"" (including the ""Show"" section, i.e. including POI), without any interaction between World and the others.

If some interaction between World and the other settings is desirable to other users, then either:
- when you change a setting in World, there should be a popup ""Copy settings to other views? Yes, no, never, always"" or similar. 
- or, each setting within ""car/bike/walk"" should have an additional option: ""same as world"".

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,New Feature: Interrupt Car FM Radio or Car CD for Navigation Voice Prompts,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hello, this seems to be an issue for more people, see links below.
Problem:
- The Phone is connected to the car audio, which is playing for example radio.
- When receiving a phone call, the radio is interrupted, and the call routed through the car audio system
- When OsmAnd outputs TTS guidance messages or beeps, the radio is NOT interrupted, regardless of the voice output option (media/audio, notification, phone call)
- When switching to bluetooth audio source on the car audio, the voice output works. But in that case on cannot hear radio or CDs anymore, of course...

Note: Sygic offers the same settings, and there the routing as a phone call correctly interrupts radio playback and plays the voice message. (and it also offers a preamble of a predefined length of silent output, so that the message is not truncated while the BT connection is being re-established)

When looking into the code, it seems that:
- all BT handling is just a passed setting to android.media.Audiomanager (in activities.SettingGeneralActivities.java the setting updates the CommandPlayer class
- routing.VoiceRouter.java seems to have a hardcoded MediaAudio.STREAM.MUSIC setting

For instance if I look up Wingepark, which is located in Rotselaar, it's showing me the street as ""Wingepark (Wezemaal)"".  But it's not located in Wezemaal, the centre just happens to be closer.

Note that Wezemaal is a subdivision of a the municipality of Rotselaar.  That is, the municipality of Rotselaar exists of (among others) towns Rotselaar en Wezemaal.  In this case they even have there own zip code, but that's not always the case.  When looking up an address and you're at the city level it's only showing Rotselaar and not Wezemaal, so that's fine.  But when showing Wingepark it shouldn't be showing anything related to Wezemaal.

If you look up ""Aarschotsesteenweg"" instead, it also shows it as being located in Wezemaal.  But it's actually located in both, and other towns. At some borders the numbering restarts, but it's the same street name.  When I look that up, it's showing me house numbers like 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 82, 126, 130, 134, 136, 140, 184, 186, 188, 190, ..., 213, 224, 300A, 320, 341, 365.

It's possible to see that osmand is calculating a route that is both longer and slower.

I can't see anything wrong in OSM data (and we can confirm that there isn't any problems in the optimal route, since it's possible to use it if we create an intermediate point).

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Better consolidation of turn situation at big intersections needed,[],"We have ""turns"" in our list of route directions (in ""route details"" and in the left widget mostly displayed as ""go straight"", sometimes as ""slight turns"") which need to be viewed in connection with other turns nearby, particularly if they are part of the same road or motorway intersection.

They should not be voice-announced or displayed as separate turns, because the driver views the whole intersection as one situation. Also, indicating separate turns for these turns in rapid succession delays the indication of the ""real turn which matters"" until the very last moment, often until after the turn lanes for the turn have already started.

A possible solution is to discover these turns which happen close together, and mask detected turns other than the ""important turn"" at an intersection in our list of route instructions by isSkipToSpeak()=true.).

Brief illustration of how the issue affects our navigation quality: What would normally be one segment all the way to the next ""real turn"" is subdivided into one segment before (mostly showing as ""go straight for x meters"") and after (""in y meters turn left/right"") the interim obsolete turn, while the better navigation info would indicate only the turn which matters to the driver ""turn left/right in x+y meters"", (ignoring the interim ""go straight"").

Situations are as follows: Turn A is turning (left) onto a larger primary road. I seem to observe this always with larger primary roads which are mapped as 2 separate parallel oneway segments. In the real world these would a have a divider in the center. The next  turn (turn B), can be right or left) after that, but is, say, 600m further.

In approach to turn A OsmAnd produces 2 bogus announcements: 
- (1)  In the makeTurnIn prompt for turn A OsmAnd falsely adds ""...then keep right/left"" (where right/left actually depends on what turn B is). I am not sure why this is added here, as turn B is still far away and we normally suppress this.
- (2) In the makeTurn prompt for turn A OsmAnd again bogus-announces ""...then in 10 meters turn right/left"" (looks like in all cases ""10 meters"" is used here.), even though turn B is >TURN_IN_DISTANCE away, and there is no turn in 10 meters.

In both cases left/right seems to correctly depend on the 600m away nextNext  turn B, but somehow the logic works as if we had a ""ghost turn"" immediately after turn A, like where you select lanes or the divided street.

After turn A is completed, no further announcement referring t the bogus ""ghost turn"" will sound (only later the correct prompts for turn B).  (Probably because the 10 meters have passed already then, see issue (3) below).)

I found no error so far in voiceRouter.java, and suspect this could have to do with the stack of route-infos we pass to it, that maybe some ""go straight"" or lane selection process at the beginning of these divided segments triggers the bogus ""then"" prompts.

I now also feel like a 3rd error I have observed for a long time is connected to this:
- (3) When you approach (straight) the beginning of a divided primary highway, and you need to continue straight for say another 600m, then take a left/right turn, OsmAnd at the beginning of the divided road seems to announce ""turn left/right"", where again left/right depends on the 600m away turn.

These are for example _sidewalk=none_ ([used 255k times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/sidewalk=none)) and the synonym _sidewalk=no_ ([used 120k times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/sidewalk=no)), _sidewalk=both_ ([used 227k times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/sidewalk=both)), _sidewalk=right_ ([used 111k times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/sidewalk=right)), _sidewalk=left_ ([used 49k times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/sidewalk=left)) and _sidewalk=separate_ ([used 12k times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/sidewalk=separate)).

Proper handling of these values could look like this:
- Assign a really low priority to ways tagged as _sidewalk=none_ and _sidewalk=no_ (a synonym) because there is no sidewalk available and walking on the road is usually dangerous. Ideally this low priority may also differ depending on the type of the road since walking on a primary road without sidewalk is way more dangerous than walking on a residential road. But I think the latter suggestion is like putting the cherry on the cake and not really needed.
- Assign the same low priority to ways tagged with _sidewalk=separate_. This tag means there _is_ a sidewalk available, but it is mapped as a separate way. Thus the current way should _not_ be used for routing.
- Assign a high priority to ways tagged as _sidewalk=both_. This priority should be higher than for ways without a sidewalk tag in order to prefer safe routes.
- Assign the same high priority to ways tagged with _sidewalk=left_ or _sidewalk=right_, but only to the corresponding direction. Not sure how difficult this is to implement.

Supporting these additional values will greatly improve foot routing in well-mapped areas.

They are present if the track or lane is only on one side of the street. Typical values are _lane_,  _track_, _opposite_ and _opposite_lane_ similar to the regular, already supported cycleway key.

Supporting these two additional keys will improve bicycle routing in well-mapped areas.

I have spent many hours researching web posts, looking at render code examples, and testing my coding attempts but still can't get it to work properly.  Also posted this request on OsmAnd Google Group with no responses.

I want to create a ""depends"" render file that will render (off-line) paths and tracks tagged with mtb:scale in different colors.  I'd also like to be able to specify custom path effect and stroke width for different zoom levels.

I know this goes at the top: renderingStyle name=""mtb-scale"" depends=""default"" defaultColor=""#f1eae4"" version=""1""

When saved in the OsmAnd rendering folder and selected from the Map Style menu, the functionality I want is:

If the tag ""mtb:scale"" for a path or track = ""0"", render that path / track in color X.

If the same tag = ""1"", render feature in color Y.

And so on, rendering different path / track colors for mtb:scale values 0-6 (I know how to code for the color values).

Even more helpful would be a simple code example that also varies the pathEffect and strokeWidth for different zoom levels.  I know how and where to save the render file on my phone.

Thank you in advance to someone for helping me figure this out!  Once I get it working properly I may propose it for inclusion as a standard vector renderer option.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Use maxspeed:advised like maxspeed:advisory in routing.xml,[],"When looking for a fastest car route, Osmand uses estimated speeds for each way.  In issue #1664 the tag `maxspeed:advisory` was added to [routing.xml](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml#L221) as a source of speed information. `maxspeed:advised` is also used to convey the same information, so could be treated the same way.
`maxspeed:advisory` is used [2850](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/maxspeed%3Aadvisory#overview) times and is documented on the [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed:advisory)
`maxspeed:advised` is used [6141](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/maxspeed%3Aadvised#overview) times but is not documented on the wiki.

An example of where this results in wrong routing is in Edinburgh. From the [intersection of north castle street and queen street](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/606316) to [the east end of Cumberland street](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/641386). The route goes down Howe street and St Vincent Street, and all the way along Cumberland street, across Dundas Street.  It should go down Queen Street Gardens East and Dundas Street.  The west section of Cumberland Street should be avoided as it is narrow and cobbled.  It is tagged `maxspeed:advised=20 mph`.

Also, it seems odd that routing.xml has a speed of [45 for tertiary roads](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml#L230) but [50 for other roads through residential areas](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml#L252).

When cycling from Zwijndrecht train station to Rotterdam (both NL) I missed some instructions and ended up [here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.85840&mlon=4.54363#map=18/51.85840/4.54363). From there, OsmAnd sent me over [this 'street'](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/159401954), which is not the most convenient route: the indicated street is actually pavement around the dressing rooms & canteen of the football club. It is not an ongoing path and you have to cross a kerb. As you can see in the image below, there's a bike path left from all the football fields which OsmAnd probably have taken with the following proposal implemented.

Therefore, I'd propose:
Avoid pedestrian streets in route calculations, unless a route point/destination is on that pedestrian street. I would do that always, although I can also imagine an extra option ""Avoid footpaths"" like there already is 'Avoid stairs' (both may be badly translated from Dutch).

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Crashes during navigation according to GPX route.,[],"I used Osmand+ for the first time for navigation using an externally created GPX route. I used a bicycle.

After a while the app crashed. I was driving quit fast at the time, so I may have missed one of the points making up the track. The fact that after this first crash Osmand tried to get me to turn back and redo a section of the route seems to point to this.

Later during the same trip, Osmand crashed again and kept crashing over and over again. When I had the time to quietly look at this I saw a question indicating the route was lost and asking me whether I want to continue with the route. This seems to default to yes after which the app crashes again. After I selected no, the crashes stopped.

This makes the app unusable for this kind of navigation for me. If I miss a point, but am still on the route, navigation should just continue where I am, not trying to redirect me to the missed point and most definitely not crash.
Also it should be possible to take a detour without losing the route or having to answer questions. There might be traffic conditions or just an interesting thing along the route causing a detour. Just (using a different coloured line for example) redirect to a suitable point on the route, without asking a question which requires interaction which may not always be possible during driving/biking. And again it should not crash. Losing a route is no reason for crashing.

It would be comfortable if these options also appear if the ""Offline vector maps"" are selected as main map and raster maps are activated as overlay/underlay maps to download/update these raster maps. Regardless of whether ""Download map"" or ""Update map"", I suggest that the subsequent menues to download or update should provide at least two checkboxes (one for overlay and one for underlay) to select whether (1) the raster map used as overlay map, (2) the raster map used as underlay map or (3) both raster maps shall be downloaded or updated.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Roads not showed at high zoom level,[],"I noticed that very often the Map Renderer of OSMand map doesn't draw part of the roads.

https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1248
https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1385
https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1686

In my opinion this is caused by the rendering algorithm. 
The actual rendering algorithm doesn't draw a way if none of the nodes that compose the way are showed on the screen. Is it correct?

This problem shows more often when the zoom is high (>17). This confirms my theory because with high zoom level the probability that a straight way doesn't have nodes shown on the map increases significantly. 

Is that right? If yes, does OSMand 2.3 correct this (I am using 2.2)?Or is someone handling this correction/problem in a future version?

I'm fairly sure this is a map-related problem. I still have an older (4th March) map of Northern Ireland, which uses the same road signage as England. Shields on A roads there are displayed correctly.

Other countries might be affected too. With the updated Singapore map, shields on motorways don't seem to be shown correctly. Note the SLE, TPE and ECP shields here:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Route action yellow arrows obscure road information,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","OsmAnd overlays routes with yellow action arrows at turns, roundabouts and other places.

Unlike the purple route overlay, these yellow arrows (which are actually a small yellow arrow joined to a path shaped along the route) are fully opaque, so they obscure details beneath.

The problem is most noticeable for short routes with many turns, which is common in urban areas. Often street names are completely obscured, as are road or path types, for example:

![opaque_yellow_arrow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/638458/15075852/75d9a8c8-139e-11e6-8ed0-7d1c7b0949b1.jpg)

Please make the yellow arrows semi-transparent so details beneath can be seen.

I tried adding an alpha component to nav_arrow in res/values/colors.xml, but this made no difference.

I made some changes to net/osmand/plus/views/RouteLayer.java:
- In `initUI()` I added:

```
    actionPaint.setAlpha(125);
    paintIconAction.setAlpha(125);
```
- In `updatePaints()` I added:

```
    actionPaint.setAlpha(125);
```

With this change, the arrows are semi-transparent:

(I don't know why the arrowhead is lighter than the path connected to it.)

Please make the arrows transparent. You don't need to use the amount of alpha that I did--I just used a relatively high value to make the change obvious.

BTW: I would be willing to experiment with changing ""routing.xml"" to tweak bike routing, and I was wondering whether I can edit routing.xml and make osmand use it without recompiling the App from the source code. I found advice on this at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/osmand/JmMQ0bQV68I/8PZlDwTtiOAJ: 

> https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-jni/blob/master/java/net/osmand/router/routing.xml
> 
> Put it to /sdcard/osmand

However, `/sdcard/osmand` does not exist on the Android device I installed osmand on.

Is the existing `/Phone/osmand/` just as well?
And can you hint on what in routing.xml would need to get tweaked to make the bike routing ""more car like"" in above example?

I'm currently using offline maps, but I'm trying OSM Live.

When I choose ""OSM Live"" in the menu, I get to the OSM Live screen, but an error is displayed: ""error: SendToken error: user id is not found"" (see attached screenshot).

I can click the ""status"" field and get to the parameters of the subscription, but clicking ""enregistrer les modifications"" (save modifications in english I guess), I get the message ""Error: error"".

Since then, without me noticing, people has submitted many translations to the Transifex project. For some reason, I didn't receive email notifications for the messages people sent me on Transifex. Recently, one of the translators contacted me by email asking about the current state of affairs.

I would want to merge all these translations on Transifex into OsmAnd, so that they don't get lost. I pushed to Transifex the changes to the source file and translations, and then pulled the translations from Transifex into my working copy.

What I'm afraid of is that it might be the case that some of these translations are wrong because they are based on an out-of-date source. Maybe we could only merge translations that are on Transifex but that are not in master, so we don't override correct translations in master with out-of-date translations from Transifex.

Together with that, I would propose removing the Transifex configuration (at `.tx`), and the Transifex project altogether, and leave the Weblate project as the only source for translations.

Basically this uses the asynchronous resampling to provide nicely spaced arrows and route markers - start a route, and zoom in a bit - you should see orange arrows and purple marker arrows over a track, dynamically adjusting as you change zoom level. The code is heaps smaller than the existing code, but there are a few things I have disabled/not implemented - specifically the different paint contexts for shadows and the like, which I do not understand.

I am aware that these changes have come along at a busy/inconvenient time for the project, and that nobody really has the time/inclination to use what I'm doing. I really needed a bit more interactivity and feedback to keep up the enthusiasm; it's just too difficult to work with, without someone to assist... but I guess it's just not the right time as there are other things happening.

USB-OTG access to USB memory sticks and SD card readers is widely available. For devices not supporting OTG there are options like USB/cardreaders which provide FTP/UPNP/Samba over WIFI in the $10-20 range, also some MIFI devices have card readers and support that. 

Those can be used without explicit support from OsmAnd by copying the map files with a file manager but it would be nice if OsmAnd would do that better:
- sync locally available maps with USB-OTG device,  making sure the newest version is in all places
- fetch maps for current region from USB-OTG into local storage if possible
- download regions (which won't fully fit into local storage) to USB-OTG storage
- remember which locally available maps were backed up to USB-OTG and can be removed from local device

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,GPX waypoints in Directions From:/To:,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi,
I love to use Osmand for planning my trips. I manage several GPX files (currently in Osmand called tracks) with GPX waypoints since it is easier to share these files with desktop applications than using groups of favourites from my point of view.

My suggestion would be to add the possibility to choose from GPX waypoints of active GPX files (""tracks"" shown on map) when selecting ""From:"" and ""To:"" in the Directions menu:
Currently Osmand provides the possibilities to choose ""My position"", ""Favourite..."", ""Select on map"" and ""Address..."". I would love to see ""GPX waypoints..."" there too.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Option to create new GPX file,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi,
I love to use Osmand for planning my trips e.g. to foreign countries. Therefore I manage several GPX files (currently in Osmand called tracks), one for each country/region, and add GPX waypoints I might be interessted to visit when I am on the trip. ""Add GPX waypoint"" and selecting an apropriate GPX file (or track) for creating a waypoint works perfertly fine.
But starting to plan a completely new trip is a little bit tricky as long as I cannot find an option to create a new (empty) GPX file within Osmand. 

My suggestion would be to add the option to create a new empty GPX file:
1) It would be very helpful if Osmand will provide an option ""New empty GPX file"" or similar in the GPX file (or track) selection menu which is shown when choosing ""Add GPX waypoint"".
2) At the moment I think it does not make sense to add ""Create a new track"" or so to ""My Places"" > ""My Tracks"" as nobody would have in mind to create an empty track, I guess. But maybe in future handling of GPX files (including tracks) will look different (for example refer to [#2451#issuecomment-209286353](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/2451#issuecomment-209286353)). If so I would be pleased to see such option in the corresponding menu.

PS. I know that Osmand supports managing waypoints as favourites in multiple groups/categories and I like the way how these groups of favourites can be hidden. I still prefer to use separate GPX files because it is easier to share these files with desktop applications or other devices from my point of view.

This notification suffers from three problems:
1. The first sentence is redundant: When the device is locked, it does not matter if the app is running in background or in foreground. The user does not need to know this. Just omit it altogether!
2.  The second sentence is important, because it is supposed to tell the user what to do. But it breaks off after ""GPS..."". So the user never knows what it tries to say! What is he supposed to do??
3. If I tap on the notification, my phone says ""tap again to open"" at the bottom of the screen. But if I tap the notification once again, the phone shows me the dot grid, and asks me to draw my screen unlock pattern. Thus the very purpose of having a notification is lost. I expect OsmAnd to come up directly without my unlocking the screen first (like how we can use the Camera app without unlocking the screen).

I would propose:
- split Austria to: Vienna metro region,  rest of eastern Austria to/including Salzburg and western Austria

I'm wondering why Osmand has weird behavior on certain crossings and roundabouts.
It sometimes tells me to make a complete loop in a roundabout, then quit on the (for instance) second exit (so, it tells me sixth exit in case of a for-roads roundabout).
In some other cases it tells me to take a road with no clear reason: for instance, on this route

it tells me to take the first crossing row on the east (heading south), then turn left and go on, instead of the correct routing shown on OSM.
On the inverse, making the west-east route, it asks me to turn right into the crossing, then come back on the same road.

I'm a cyclist and often I plan routes with OsmAnd. It would be very useful that spot/roads to be avoided would be permanent and managed in a section, as the favorites.

It may be that,  for a user like Me, a particular spot is always to avoid  and he never want to go through.

I tested last nigthly build and avoid 'spot' ( [#2113](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/2113)) works correctly, avoiding only a part of the road. But restarting the application, spots to avoid are erased, and new calculated routes pass through them.

It would be nice to be able to set the points to avoid either temporarily (as now), or permanently, in a sort of black-list you may manage (as favorites).
In case of permanent avoid-spot, they should be shown on the map.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Tile download bug - can someone explain this?,[],"I still think the tile downloading has a bug. Please consider this log sequence... (edited for clarity)...

So we have 10258 start loading twice in 0.013 seconds. Then...

04-04 20:09:01.115  22614-30244... Downloading tile : http://tile.osmand.net/hd/14/14927/10258.png successfull 502 ms

Tile 10258 has successfully downloaded about a half a second later, then...

04-04 20:09:01.441  22614-30325... Downloading tile : http://tile.osmand.net/hd/14/14928/10258.png successfull 815 ms

Another 10258 tile (we made two requests, after all) has loaded, a fraction of  second later.

04-04 20:09:01.457  22614-30326... Downloading tile : http://tile.osmand.net/hd/14/14927/10259.png successfull 832 ms

And finally 10259 has arrived. I see this ALL THE TIME. Multiple downloads of tiles for which a request has already been made. There's no server interruption or dropping - this case clearly shows two copies being requested, two copies being retrieved successfully. Having a bit of a guess here, if those numbers (e.g, 22614-30326) are thread IDs, could it be that multiple threads are not seeing that a tile download request has already been made by another thread, thus causing multiple downloads?

I just think this is inefficient in data usage and speed/bandwidth.
If this is not a bug, could someone please explain to me what is happening?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Announcing: Turn around in stead of turn left/right,"[Label(name=""Offline Routing"")]","![2016-04-02 14 18 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15076257/14234426/da60a3d0-f9e2-11e5-82b7-1ae9b4c9c3a0.png)

It is [this location](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.07573/4.82049)

When there are two left (or right) turns close after each other, OsmAnd announces ""turn around to  streetname...."" (in Dutch: ""Keer om naar ....) not even specifying left of right.
Also the wrong streetname is used.

It could be better to show and say ""turn right and immediately turn right again"" (of left..)
A ""turn around"" should only be used for a real U-turn when the names of the streets are the same.

This was changed about half year ago - before that it was okay.
It also happens with two turns to the right.

Another example: on [this location](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.08987/4.87933)

The point is not added to list of roads to avoid.

Not in the new manner:  Long tap on point on the route; Three Dots from ContextMenu - Avoid Road

The route is calculated again, but the blocked roads still used.

Shortly after the Avoid Road was added to ContextMenu all was working fine.
The new way to set a Blocked Road was a real improvement, with icons on the map showing all blocked locations.

It would be very nice to dismiss this dialog automatically after a few seconds, similar to the dialog asking whether to continue the previous route. Otherwise this dialog blocks the map. It also blocks the mentioned dialog about continuing the previous route which usually gets dismissed automatically, but not if the exception dialog is present. Sometimes it's not possible or very cumbersome to dismiss the dialog manually, for example if the phone is contained in some casing.

Unfortunately I haven't found a simple way to reproduce them but I hope these backtraces are still kind of useful. The crashes happen both after startup (either instantly or a little later during panning) and during routing.

Maybe the cause is just my phone having too few RAM. It's a Huawei Y300 with Android 4.4 and has a total memory of 512 MB but of course the available free memory is way less than that.

If in OsmAnd you first start a GPX logging, say with interval 30sec, so that the background service is started with interval also set to 30 sec., and you then start a navigation in follow mode, the bg service interval does not seem to be updated from 30sec to ""Continuous"", hence the backkgrund navigation will be carried out with the 30sec interval.

Maybe this accounts for one or the other navigation issue we have heard about late or missing turn instructions, screen not coming on in time, etc.

It's setup so that newer stuff (distance markers, rainbow altitude, speed, etc.) can later be 'plugged in' as new classes, inheriting all the good stuff from this minimal set.  The set includes asynchronous line culling, and supports 'current Track' (which should not be culled). 

Features are basically asynchronous line reduction to minimise points and improve visuals at lower zooms, and very very very quick screen drawing of tracks. Did I say very quick?

Once you come back you can click on map source and select the sources, just like GPX option.  It is very confusing for new users to realise you have to turn on map source to see aything, especially when it doesn't look like a ""turn on"" type thing in the menu.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Render/Zoom/Refresh ordering,[],"I think there's a small bug in the process of rendering/zooming.
What I think is happening is that there are a number of ""zoom"" levels which require complete redraws/renders because, for example, the tile sets are completely different. These are powers of two different from each other. Between those levels are ""scaled"" images of the lower level. So when you zoom in, you see alternating next zoom level, or a scale of the existing level. That's all fine.
But if you look at the zooming in this video:  https://youtu.be/WkT1JFqYjPc
At around 26 seconds I zoom in and the arrows become visible for the first time. If you look carefully you see them briefly ""big"" arrows, and then back to the correct size. What I think is happening here is that as I zoom in, the scaler first kicks in to show the current data at the higher zoom scale (that's OK) and then the arrows are drawn, and _then the screen is refreshed_ and THEN the zoom scaler is reset, and _then the screen is refreshed_ so we see the new zoom level at the unscaled version.  This is wrong, because it shows the arrows (and anything else) briefly at a magnified version unsuitable for the zoom for which it was drawn. The correct solution, I think, is to reset the zoom scaler just before the first refresh.
I hope this makes sense and you can understand what I'm trying to explain.
TL;DR - scaling should not flash big and then revert to correct size.

Osmand renders State and County routes with the same shield which can be confusing as numbering can be similar. To fix this I think either the rendering should fall back to the older ""CR *""

The template for a standard county shields are [2 digit](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MUTCD_M1-6_template_00.svg) [3+ digit](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MUTCD_M1-6_template_000.svg). The name and county words are probably not needed, only the route number.

So.... why are tiles being downloaded, and isn't this a huge bandwidth/time waste?  As you can see, many of the tiles are being downladed more than once, too. This seems like a bug to me, especially when the screen is completely static and all needed tiles are already shown!

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Extreme Slow rendering with OSM Live,[],"Since enabling OSM Live some days ago, rendering became extremely slow. Taking nearly half a minute to fully render a screen makes OsmAnd unusable.

This seems to be similar to issue #1843, but since that issue was closed long ago I assume it was fixed.

Screenshot with rendering statistics:

The base map I use is from The Netherlands from March 5, 2016. And I have the following files in the OsmAnd live folder:

After removing the files from the OsmAnd Live folder rendering speed increases enormously:

In this example I used Amsterdam, but other cities and rural areas are also slow.

But you may not pay close attention to these messages (or may lose track over time, whether the GPS fix is available or not).

Now if you tap the ""Next turn"" icon, OsmAnd should respond that the GPS fix is still missing. Instead, it reads out the last known distance to the next turn (that's the same status when the GPS connection was lost).

But when the screen is turned off, OsmAnd announces only the ""GPS signal is lost"" message, but does not announce when the GPS signal is recovered. But it resumes the voice-assisted navigation.

Strangely, when I unlock the phone, OsmAnd immediately makes the pending ""GPS signal restored"" announcement. (But the actual GPS signal was recovered long ago!)

A major issue with this is, you never know if OsmAnd will alert you about the next turn, or are you on your own??

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OsmAnd+ hangs during route planning and extra destination selection,[],"I'm using OsmAnd+ 2.3.3 on a Samsung Galaxy S5 running Android 5 and I have similar problems as @Barrocas in issue #2363.

I can't reproduce the exact problem in that thread but I think it's linked to what I've found below.

I've noticed OsmAnd becoming unresponsive in several cases. **First case**:
1. Long-press the map to bring up the context menu.
2. Press the blue navigation button _before_ the address lookup has completed:
   ![osmand_unresponsive](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/638458/14107641/4b1fc0f0-f5b1-11e5-84af-ca1d1594a2db.jpg)
3. Result: OsmAnd hangs and is unresponsive until the route is calculated. (Most of my routes are under 50 km so calculating the route is usually quite quick, but this is still a regression.) logcat shows that the route finding doesn't start until after the address search completes (`RouteProvider Start finding route from Location...` appears _after_ the address search in logcat).

**Second case**: OsmAnd hangs when trying to view the list of steps in a route by pressing the button to the right of the estimated time:

![osmand_route_planning](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/638458/14107616/2bd3163e-f5b1-11e5-86a7-7f15eae95016.jpg)

logcat shows that each time the button is pressed, another address search is done:

If we trust the durations in here, this took around 8.6 seconds. It felt much longer. Another minor problem here is that the > button/arrow isn't disabled on the last step of the route.

**Third case**: often (but not always--I can usually reproduce after force stopping OsmAnd with adb using `am force-stop net.osmand.plus`) after creating a route, when long-pressing the map to select another intermediate point, the app hangs:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Clearer voice instructions for (a) lane guidance and (b) entering a flyover or underpass,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","By and large, OsmAnd provides human-like voice instructions.

In the following two conditions, the sentence needs to be improved, though:

**1. Approaching a flyover of underpass:**
When we are supposed to take a flyover or underpass, OsmAnd should tell us to ""go up the flyover"" and ""go down the underpass"". This results in clearer meaning.

**2. ""keep left"" vs ""take the left-most lane""**
Often the voice instruction is a little vague. In Bangalore, we have some flyovers where the center lane enters a flyover, while the left and right lanes split up the road and turn left and right. So a ""keep left"" instruction sounds vague, and does not fit the scene ahead of us. (keep how much left??)

Instead, it should say ""TAKE the left-most lane"" or ""TAKE the middle lane and then enter the flyover""
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Getting quick voice instructions from OsmAnd about the upcoming junction,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","After I switched to a 5.5"" phone, even my old phone mount is unable to handle it. My second car does not have a mount for a phone at all.

Thus I have to leave the phone down on the co-driver's seat and rely on OsmAnd's voice guidance (which are usually sufficient).

But this creates a new problem: The FM radio of my car may mask any voice instructions from OsmAnd, and I may miss a turn instruction.

On the other hand, OsmAnd often keeps silent when we are supposed to pass straight through a road junction, or a multi-lane situation. 

So at each crossing or fork, I face a dilemma: Did I miss the voice instruction from OsmAnd, or does it want me to go straight??

At such times, there should be a gesture that forces OsmAnd to respond with a voice instruction, about what to do with the upcoming junction.

For example, imagine that a double-tap on screen evokes ""keep going straight"" voice response. 
Or it could be ""take the left lane and then go to the flyover.""

This feature is different from tapping on the arrow icon (at the top-left corner of the screen).
But equally useful.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,New GPX track rendering and animation/overlay package.,[],"WHAT THIS PROVIDES:

A generic rendering/draw of GPX tracks that allows multiple 'renders' to be included as a part of the draw of any TrkSegment. These 'renders' include the basic track drawing, but also other options such as dashed lines, rainbow-coloured altitude indication, speed indication, arrows to point direction, animating 'lines' showing direction of movement, and dots/text showing 1km (or any other) distances along tracks.  It's very extendable and incredibly cheap in terms of processing speed.

For a view of some of these operating on this version of the code, see [https://youtu.be/aRGCNLmBAlk] this video.

`Additionally,` all of the above have automatic asynchronous track resampling - either via line culling of
Ramer-Douglas-Peucer (implemented for the base track draw at different zooms), or an actual resampler that takes a distance and steps off and creates a new track with points spaced exactly that distance apart along the original track. The asynchronous resampling/culling willl automatically enable the new (optimal) track display when the background task has completed.

This is completely up to date with the master branch as of an hour or so ago!

Two modified files
- GPXUtilities
  Added some fields to WptPt to enable distance measurement on tracks and colouring for altitude/speed
- GPXLayer
  Installed the new track rendering with examples (commented/out)

Two new files
- AsynchronousResampler.java
  Implements line resampling and culling asynchrnonously for all line drawing
- Renderable.java
  Set of classes for drawing different kinds of gpx 'renders'
  - normal with automatic Ramer-Douglas-Peucer line culling
  - conveyor-belt type animation of segments on a path
  - altitude colouring of a path

My phone is in English (United States) and I switch the ""Voice guidance"" to German in the ""General Settings"".  This works great for one navigation, then the next time I setup a navigation, it switches to Dutch.  First, just the voice switches to Dutch, then after a while, the preference itself will show that Dutch is chosen.  This happens every time, so now I just set up my navigation, then switch the language to English, then back to German, and I get the German voice.

We do seem to have a bit of a language/terminology/understanding issue.

What I've done here is honour all the requests you have made, as far as I understand them.

Specifically, the custom .gpx ""zoom"" is honoured with auto-scaling - those tracks which specify ""zoom"" will automatically become big/small as you zoom in and out. All other tracks do not - the track width is left to whatever the rest of the code has set it to (ie., either a single width for all zooms, or different width for each zoom - via an XML description).

However, there is a switch to enable auto-scaling on all tracks. This would be useful, for example, in the case where there is just the one width set for all zoom levels and you WANT it to scale. It's useful to ME because I can continue testing/reviewing the GPX track stuff. It defaults to OFF.

Please note the comment about why scaling doesn't work when you change track width - the hash on updatePaints preventing that code running more than once, and thus preventing knowledge about the width change getting to my code. Point is moot, really - as you will not be running my code in that situation, anyway (well, unless you turn on the autoscaling). But that's why it didn't seem to work when you tested.

For the record, I'm planning to do some experiments with colouring of tracks
- bringing in elevation data from the GPX
- bringing in time data 
- using these to indicate altitude/speed via colour changes

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Reworked GPX display.,[],"1. GPX track colour can come from .gpx file (as before) via <extensions> block. However, this was previously
   on an entire-track basis. Since the reader code also worked when an <extensions> block was placed inside a <trk> or
   <trkseg> block, I have honoured this implicit arrangement.  So, if an extension containing <color> is inside a <trkseg>
   then that segment will be drawn in the selected colour. If there is no colour specified for a segment, it will draw
   in it's parent track's colour. If the parent's colour is not specified, it will draw in the GPX file's colour. If
   none is specified then the default OsmAnd colour is used.
2. Track width is also configurable on per-segment. I added <zoom>1.0</zoom> into the <extensions>, so if you put
   that in either a gpx <trk> or <trkseg> then you will get scaling of the width of the drawn segments. The zoom is
   relative to default size, so 1.0 is 100%. To draw double-thick lines, use 2.0, or half-width 0.5.

With (1) and (2) you can use one or both inside the <extensions> block.

The reasoning for the above is that you may wish to have some tracks marked with easy and difficult sections, or
by different surface types, etc., By putting colouring capability in segments you can do all of that.

3) Reduced points for speedups.  Huge GPX files with hundreds of thousands of points could potentially slow the UI down.
I have implemented point-reduction at runtime so that tracks are displayed using the minimum number of points required
to maintain visual integrity. Code is inside GPXLayer.java and uses Ramer-Douglas-Peucer algorithm. Selection criteria
for culling points is based on view zoom level.  The culled point set is cached, so the line reduction only happens when
there is a change in zoom, or number of points in the original line. The reduction could theoretically replace the
""offscreen"" culling code, because that code has a number of bugs;
- e.g., 1) lines just offscreen are clipped but you can see curved ends on them when they shouldn't be.
  2) some lines that should be onsceen are totally culled. I have a sample track demonstrating this bug.

My preference would be to simply rely on the point culling to give great perfomance and drop the segment onscreen checks.

4) Scaling based on view zoom - the line widths are modified according to the view zoom modified by (2) the track
zoom. Now when you zoom right out, you don't get a large block of ""mess"" - in fact tracks are legible right down to very
small sizes (zooming right out).  It's a lovely thing.

Foreground navigation runs equally well on both devices, including TTS-voice-announcements that come ""at about the right time"" on both devices.

But ""sleep mode"" aka ""background"" navigation runs well only on the Note 2, while on the Elephone Q, it seems that only very seldom (like every other minute or so) the location is updated, resulting in voice announcements that come far too late, long after a turn should have been taken.

Another symptom is that on the Note 2, when leaving sleep mode (by pressing the key), the GPS indicator shows immediately that there's a GPS lock, while on the Elephone Q, when leaving sleep mode, the GPS indicator always says ""0/_n_"", indicating no GPS lock, and it takes a second or two until a GPS lock is again established.

So it seems that for whatever reason, GPS positioning is turned of most of the time when the display is off, only on the Elephone Q. 

I have looked for any options regarding GPS activity in sleep mode, but didn't find any, not even in the Elephone Q's comprehensive ""engineering mode"" (YGPS, invoked via _#_#3646633#_#_).

Any idea what could keep Osmand from keeping GPS ""alive"" while sleeping?

It looks to me there is no easy way to know if a road / track is usable by car during winter, because it depends if it already has snowed or not.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Simplify GPX file import steps,[],"While fixing a small bug with GPX2favorutes import (https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/commit/8365f70eb5cd084b571b8ea3c7015285abc9145e) I notice that we probably have an obsolete wiggle in our file import process:

Here https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/helpers/GpxImportHelper.java#L70 we fork to either handleFavouritesImport (if the file name in question contains ""favorite"" or ""favourite""), subsequently user has the choice to either import wpt points contained in the GPX file to favorites, or simply copy the GPX file to the osmand/tracks/import folder. Otherwise we fork to handleGpxImport, where the file is directly copied to the tracks/import folder without interim choice dialog.

I think the second case is obsolete. Instead, we should always, regardless if the file name contains 
""favo(u)rite"" or not, show the dialogue offering the choice between ""copy"" and ""import to favorites"".

Making the appearance of the dialog dependent on the file name is not obvious to any user, and serves no functional purpose, I think?

I suggest replacing lines 70 - 75 of GpxImportHelper.java by simply the following code: (The handleGpxImport case deleted here is automatically forked to later after the dialog):
        } else {
            handleFavouritesImport(intentUri, fileName, saveFile);

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,POI information need some fixing & visual improvements,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Searching for and displaying a POI will show extra info about it such as website and phone number. However the look and feel is not quite right:
- For POIs which have both a website and wikipedia entry, the wikipedia url entry takes priority over the poi webpage url when really they both should be displayed. And the full wikipedia URL does not have to be shown, just an icon or text linking the url. [Example screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12941728/13277034/65385850-da93-11e5-99c7-67053786e946.png)
- Urls would look cleaner if they were stripped of the http:// and any trailing /.
- For phone numbers, depending on the format, the number is not properly parsed and linked for handling by external applications. eg the format (123) 456-7890 works fine but 123 456 7890 does not. Ideally the entries in OSM should conform to a standard format but in reality that can't be expected. [Example screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12941728/13277034/65385850-da93-11e5-99c7-67053786e946.png)
- Ideally raw tags should be cleaned up to a more human readable format. For example see ""Cuisine: coffee_shop"" should really be Cuisine: Coffee Shop.
- Instead of explicitly writing out tags for boolean features of a place (eg ""internet access:yes"" or ""drive-in:yes"", wheelchair, etc) it would look cleaner and easier to read if they were represented as icons indicating 'yes' or 'no'. Then can click on the icon to get the meaning of the icon or more info.

- Images arn't loaded but take up large blocks of space. So remove them (or since they link to the image in wikipedia, then have an small clean icon indicating an image.
- TOC and reference links don't do anything. They should be re-written to navigate the article.
- With the dark theme, the article summary looks fine but the full article still has black text on white background which is inconsistent with the theme and irritating to read in the dark.
- The article summary should be stripped down such as removing images, image descriptions, TOC.
- Some numbers in the article summary (eg 2006) act as URLs which are opened as phone numbers.
- Link to to full online wikipedia article should be easier/faster to get to (less clicks). Maybe for consistency have same as the rest of the POIs with the link in the details (ie have the ""Wikipedia"" label as a link to external apps similar to phone numbers and websites. related: #2273

Maybe the coastline - in areas where it crosses the 180th meridian - is incomplete in the osmand map data and the missing information is replaced by some higher order shapelines?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Position hops between GPS and last Passive/Network ,[],"This is happening on an Android 4.2.2 device.
It may or may not be relevant that the device runs the UnifiedNLP Legacy Network Location and the PersonalWifiBackend

This used to happen sporadically and a reboot of the device would correct it.
Since some update of osmand it happens all the time. Sorry I can't be more specific. It's only now that I am convinced that the behaviour is constant. 

When I open osmand it will usually show the position as determined by wifi APs and as soon as the device acquires GPS lock, the position begins to hop between the wifi and the gps position, this happens about once every second. This can be annoying if there are no currently known APs as it can cause a jump of large distances as one moves away from the last know wifi based location. 
If there are wifi APs about, the position will constantly jump back to the last position when the AP was observed, which is consistent with how personalwifibackend works, but it's very annoying.

I have no idea where to go looking in the code, and I note nobody else reports this, but then it is a special case. I'm reporting the issue in case it might grab somebody's attention. 

As I said it may or may not be an osmand issue, but I am only observing this behaviour with osmand. Maybe something to do with the way it polls the location?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Specific car routing map style,[],"I feel a difficulty and need to have a specific style for driving mode (using a car) in osmand and I think that it needs a map style for this.

It should prioritize, whether possible, driving and highway related stuff:
- exit numbers/names (`highway=motorway_junction`)
- highways's `ref`
- `amenity=fuel`
- `highway=services`
- `highway=rest_area`
- `emergency=phone`
- `barrier=toll_booth` (with a possible different color when the highway has `toll=yes`)
- `traffic_calming`

Pedestrian related objects (`highway=path`, `highway=footway`, `highway=steps`, etc) shouldn't be displayed.
Most probably polygons should be ommited as well (`landuse`, `building`, etc), together with shops/amenities, `leisure`, etc.

I think that MapQuest Open style does a good job in highlighting the highways, `ref` and `motorway_junction`, for example:

Since we don't want to listen ""attention"" for 11 times, nor it's benefical to have that amount of aural warning, osmand should group identical nearby objects and issue just one warning for a group.

It seems that permissions in Android are a mess now (it asks to allow access to the storage, to read the maps, access to location, etc).

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Keep green flag for starting point when defining a destination point manually.,[],"_Issue similar to #2192:_

Preparation for reproducing issue: (seen on 2.3.0#15657 from 09-02-2016)

Have NO destination and NO waypoint defined inside Osmand app, and have NO GPS fix.

When defining a STARTING point via long tap on the map, via three-dots-menu and then choose ""Directions from"" ... I can see the starting point with the green flag, covered by the orange round position marker, with the ""Navigation Menu"" where you can choose car foot bicycle etc. OK.

According to the user interface intention I can now define my destination by tapping the ""Select destination"" field, by choosing a Favourite..., Selecton map or Address...

This also works fine, and after some seconds, the route is calculated wit that purple line.

BUT now imagine the case where I have defined only the starting point via the green flag, and I dismiss the dialog field (with the icons for car, bicycle, foot, from: to: Distance, Time, the X, flag, gear wheel and the Go field) because I want to scroll first to quite another part of the map or find POIs manually in my destination area.

So you have the map again covering the whole screen, and only a start defined with green flag.

Now I decide to define my destination point manually by a long tap anywhere on the map. So the dialog box with Location, icons for favourites, waypoints, share and the three dots comes up.

The only way to define the destination now is to select the blue circle with the white arrow symbol.

When doing this, the green flag and so my starting point is **deleted**!

**Why??**

I have to define my starting point *_anew *_from the dialog box!

What is the reason for ""deleting"" the green flag, and not keeping it like the destination flag or waypoint flag?
Are there any technical reasons?

Because I really would appreciate when a defined starting point is kept by osmand, to do a free route planning.

Starting point and green flag could be overridden when navigation is started by user via Go-button or similar, and when Osmand app HAS a GPS fix.

So please:
Keep green flag for starting point when defining a destination point manually afterwards.

PS: also when having a green flag on the free whole screen covering map, and then choosing the ""navigation"" button (white button in the bottom left corner with a grey square and a white arrow inside), the green flag gets deleted also! Why?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"[Feature Request] time average of ""Current Speed"" and orientation ""Moving Direction""","[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","**_1.) Time Average of ""Current Speed"" display:_**
Especially during walking the speed calculated at the basis of the GPS signal is very inaccurate and unsteady although I walk very steady.
The displayed ""current speed"" in the right upper corner (if activated) could be massively improved, **if a time-average function is implemented**.
This could be done by providing e.g. 1/5/10/60/300 second intervalls in which the calculated speed is averaged. An easy GUI implemtation could be a long-tap at the speed display to toggle between these values displayed then inside the symbol.

**_2.) Time Average of orientation speed if  ""Moving Direction"" is selected:_**
Especially if one moves fast through very sharp curves (lets say a double 180° curve) it makes no sense that the map orientation follows the movemente instantly if ""moving direction"" is selected.

A better way would be **time-average rotation of the map**, to allow fast changes of direction and only if one stays at a new direction the map should be orientated. 
This could be done by providing e.g. 1/5/10/30/60 second intervalls in which thedirection needs to be changed until the map orientation is also rotated. An easy GUI implemtation could be a long-tap at the ""moving direction"" symbol to toggle between these values displayed then inside the symbol.

It could also save some CPU power if less orientation-rendering has to be performed.

It would be great if these improvements could be implemente in the next version of OSMAnd.

It drives my completely crazy while playing arount with a route optimization. I needed to change the profile from car to bike everytime after I canceled the route mode.

In my opinion the ""standard profile"" should only be activated at program startup and not during normal usage, as the user normally don't changes the kind of vehicle between two route calculations.

A main problem for me was the **missing tool-tips** (with normally should appear with a long-tap at the questionable symbol in modern piece of software).

Without these tooltips I had to click every and every symbol to discover its functionality (which provides in the case of routing and waypoints massive room for improvment in comparison to v2.1.1) and sometimes don't have the possibility to go back easily.

The OSMAnd GUI now follows the principle ""learning-by-doing-and messing-up"" instead of ""learning-by-reading"" which I would much prefer!

Similarly if the `opening_hours` was `mo-fr 07:00-19:00; sa 12:00-18:00; su 14:00-17:00` all the time information would be taken from `su`

One thing I've noticed with the street name search is it searches with a ""begins with"" algorithm.
The problem that this causes is in French the street type is at the start i.e. Boulevard Montclair. Where in English this would be Montclair Boulevard. This causes problems when you don't know if the street is: Rue, Boulevard, Avenue, Impasse, etc

One solution would to allow results that contain what your are typing and not necessarily only starting with it.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Improvements to mtb stylesheet (use mtb:scale=0 and class:bicycle:mtb),[],"Some small changes could make the OsmAnd [mtb stylesheet](http://osmand.net/help/Map-Legend_default.html) much better:
- Use a separate color for mtb:scale=0. Right now, it is impossible to see the difference between a trail with mtb:scale=0 and a trail without mtb:scale (which could be anything between 0 and 7).
- Use a highlighting based on the class:bicycle:mtb (see [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Class:bicycle)) tags, to highlight the nice trails and hide the ugly trails.

In general, consider using the colors of [mtbmap.no](http://mtbmap.no/#15/63.4306/10.3329), which fits better with the colors people are used to from e.g. skiing maps / piste maps. See [mtbmap.no stylesheet](http://mtbmap.no/assets/legend_retina.png). This stylesheet works excellent and is more easily readable than your current mtb stylesheet, in my opinion.

However, such grades (+/-) are described on the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mtb:scale#How_to_Map_it_-_Usage.2C_Tags_and_Values), and although they are not extensively used, they should be rendered.

Have NO destination and NO waypoint defined inside Osmand app, and have NO GPS fix.

When defining the destination point via long tap on the map and pressing the blue circle button, I can define a destination.
Then I can return to normal map view in order to pan, zoom and scroll the map like I want. The chequered flag for the destination point is still visible. Fine!
So I can do route planning like I want without loosing destination point.

Same is possible for waypoints.

Further consider this:

clear destination point and all waypoints if still defined.

When defining a STARTING point via long tap on the map, via three-dots-menu and then choose ""Directions from"" ... I can see the starting point with the green flag, covered by the orange round position marker, with the ""Navigation Menu"" where you can choose car foot bicycle etc. OK.

BUT when I now tapping on any position in the map (or chooseing the ""X"" button in the bottom left corner of Navigation Menu, the green flag DISSAPPEARS.

Why?

What is the reason for ""deleting"" the green flag, and not keeping it like the destination flag or waypoint flag?
Are there any technical reasons?

Because I really would appreciate **when a defined starting point is kept by osmand**, to do a free route planning.
Starting point and green flag could be overridden when navigation is started by user via Go-button or similar, and when Osmand app HAS a GPS fix.

So please:

The idea is to prompt the user when he is driving: A card shows the next POI/Favorite.

But this design has the following drawbacks:
 1 The user has to delete a huge number of points</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;(or else he will keep getting pop-up reminders while he is driving, which is annoying and distracting)</br>
 2 While setting up the route, the user is expected to plan everything in advance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we do many unplanned things along the way: </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;We get hungry/tired on the way. We run low on gas. Then we start looking for a right kind of POI.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the design should be such that the driver can find any types of POIs whenever needed.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This search should not distract him from his driving.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Imagine him asking Siri, ""where is the nearest gas station?"" and getting directed there...)</br>

**_Suggestion:**_
Remove the POI+Favorite lists from Route Editor altogether.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, provide a button in Navigation mode, where the driver can quickly call for POIs of certain type with only 2-3 taps.

**_Desired:**_ 
Let the user tap on the left side of the card (area that displays (a) the icon of the place, (b) the distance+offset and (c) the name of the place.)

Immediately, OsmAnd should add that point to the route, and recalculate the route.

The  **_overflow**_ button in the card is meant to be used while the user is driving. But this is not useful at all: If he taps this button, he is presented with a bewildering list of destinations, POIs and Favorites. Clearly, he cannot deal with the complexity while driving. So why is this quick control provided??

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Functional Issues with our downloaded regions layer,[],"While Issue #2152 refers to our download maps screens, this Issue refers to how we indicate the download status of regular maps by dyeing them on the map at zooms 4-6:

(1) Without Internet connection, all activated maps are always reported as uptodate, while their update status is actually ""unknown"".

(2) Without Internet connection, deactivated maps are not indicated at all

(3) But with Internet connection, deactivated maps are suddenly reported also (at least after the All downloads list was refreshed), but are always reported as outdated, even if they are uptodate.

(4) There are maps which we changed or which do not exist anymore. Examples are Mexico_centralamerica (is now Mexico_northamerica), or Italy, or Africa (we now only offer Region_italy, or Country_africa). Whoever still has these maps: They are always reported as uptodate, while their ""true"" status is actually ""not found/identified on server at all"".

These points (particularly (3) and (4) triggered this issue, surprisingly), confuse some users because they think they have maps ready, which they actually cannot use (deactivated ones, (3)), or do not see maps which are actually indexed ok and are usable (4). Then they find they cannot rely on the whole DownloadedRegionsLayer at all (1+2).

We either need to
(A) Fix what we actually wanted to achieve by color-coding the regions here, i.e. consistently show all a regions, and also consistently indicate when regions are deactivated, and when their update status is unknown
(B) or we should strictly simplify all this to a ""coverage only"" functionality, by simply only showing all actually indexed standard maps here, regardless of their update status. (Maybe or not indicate deactivated ones in a second color).

For now I am leaning towards (B), because
- having many different overlay shading colors on the map screen (we already have uptodate, selected, being-downloaded, and now would also need unknown, deactivated, and possible combinations of all these) is extremely confusng and not helpful. We have no good legend either.
- Plus: Detailed status requires looking at more map types like Wikipedia etc. anyway, which we cannot code here.
- Plus: Maps get outdated within days (because we update regularly), so for the majority of users who have many countries present, they are all shown outdated most of the time, so color-coding for them this is not very useful information. (Most will use this layer only to see what they have and what not, and to select new regions for download).
- And for those who are interested in their update status on a day-2-day basis, they will probably use our new OSM Live mechanism anyway, and check status on that screen.

"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Revisit ""Manage map files""",[],"I have observed many users struggling with the way we display our screens for ""Manage map files"".

The primary confusion comes from how we structure the 3 different screens:

(A) The ""All Downloads"" screen is structured ""Continent""/""Country""/""Map types"", often with further subcategories ""Regions""/""Map types"".
- (A1) Needless to say: Some categories overlap, and lead to users having overlapping files of the same type with no obvious way to detect this.
- (A2) Depending on the level you are on, list entries can represent files itself, or can be headlines which can be drilled down further.

(B) The ""Local"" screen is structured ""Map types""/ ""Country-or-Region"" only, all entries directly represent files.

(C) The ""Updates"" screen is simply a flat list with the map type indicated in the line item itself.

This creates the following issues:

(1) When you go from screen to screen, the structure changes with every tap.

(2) Our icon color coding can also not be consistent, of course: While e.g. ""orange"" next to something which represents a file means ""updateable"", ""orange"" next to something which represents a headline (and can be drilled down further) seems to only represent that you have the corresponding country-wide standard map present (while sub-country level standard maps or other country-wide map types present locally under that headline are ignored for the color assignment), right? As a result, the icon next to ""Germany"" on the ""All downloads"" screen always remains white no matter what you have downloaded for Germany, because there is no country-wide standard map.

(3) On some screens the dates for the items represent the server date, while on others the date of the local file. On no screen can you see both for direct comparison, this most-needed functionality is missing.

All this is not very obvious. I honestly think that a ""less is more"" simplification approach is better here:
- Why not use (and this partly goes back to what we had for years) only one screen
- With the elaborate structure of the ""All downloads"" screen
- Add 2 buttons to it ""Display only locally present files"" and ""Display only updates"", but when one of these filters is in place keep the tree structure. (Maybe expand it all.)
- The details for each file item should show, maybe in 2 lines, both the local file data and the server file data
- When the ""Local"" filter is set, expanding all files into one list on one screen but with the ""Continent"" / ""Country"" /... hierarchy shown, better facilitates spotting overlapping files. But we should also provide an automatic way to do display this, maybe mark overlapping files with a purple ""overlapping"" remark.

(4) As a secondary finding: The level on which we provide downloads is not very consistent, particularly for the SRTM downloads we often provide many very small files for provinces (while all other map types are provided on country level), Algeria can serve as an example here.

An app using the Intent ""google.navigation:q=<address>"" is starting osmand, but osmand cannot recognize the address and doesn't parse it. It seems, only google.navigation:q=<lat>,<lon> is supported by OsmAnd. Some apps unfortunately don't provide a geo-intent so OsmAnd cannot be used for routing.
Following https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/intents ""geo"" is for searching a location and ""google.navigation"" is to navigate to the given point or address. I believe OsmAnd should fully implement the ""google.navigation"" intent to ensure full interoperability with other apps.
Since OsmAnd can use ""geo:0,0?q=<address>"" it should be pretty easy to implement the additional Intent. Other routing-apps like here are working properly.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Compass 90 degrees off on Samsung Galaxy Camera 2,[],"Hi,

My device is a Samsung Galaxy Camera 2 (EK-GC200, Android 4.3)
With ""Map-orientation=To compass"" the map is always displayed 90 degrees off.
The North on the map is always heading to the East.
I have calibrated many times - that makes no difference.

In car-navigation I mostly use ""Map-orientation=to direction of movement"", so that's no problem.
But wih hiking and exploring the 90 degrees off is really annoying.

Are there more devices with the same problem?

To be honest: a lot of the G-Playstore Compass Apps have the same problem.
Like ""GPS-Status&Toolbox"" 
and ""AR Bearing+Baseplate Compass"" from Appyhand
and ""inViu GPS-details""
I raised issues there, but no reaction from those devs.

But some other Compass-apps are working real fine.
Like ""3D Compass and Magnetometer"" from Plaincode.
and ""Compass & Spirit Level"" from Crunchy ByteBox

I suppose it has something to do with landscape being the default screen orientation on startup of the Galaxy Camera.

    Triangular (not filled, orange) / Rectangular (orange)

I think there should be an incremental update on the maps. There are some ways to do this, which should be tested which is more effective, and causes less server load.

I don't really know how the new maps are generated, but there should be something like an update schedule, e.g. update end user offline maps once a week.
- Use rsync to update
- Maps on the server can just stay as they are, only an rsync server needs to be set up.
- Update process on the client won't change so much
- Any update path is possible. The more changes, the more data to be transferred. But never more than a full update
- Will demand CPU load on the server, maybe this is the problem
- Use binary updates
  So for update 1 in 2016, there is the file 201601.map. To get your local version 201552 to update, you just need to download and apply 201552201601.diff and you are done.
- Small updates
- No CPU server load (only once during creation)
- Needs creation of the incremental update files. But this should be scriptable
- The map will take about 2.5x the space during update (old mal, new map, diff file)
- Use sqlite updates
  Also the same like in binary updates, but create update scripts.
- Might break the sqlite file on error.

So any change will have the need to change the client, so I did not list it for the options.

If, on the other hand, after a fresh app start you wait say 30+ seconds before starting the first context menu / reverse lookup, all is fine. The first as well as all subsequent lookups will then speedily either produce a result, or immediately report that no address can be determined.

The issue is observed with latest nightlies. Our nightly of Dec 5 did not have the issue yet (there only the very first lookup failed if it was too early, with subsequent lookups working ok).

We do not indicate the fact if Avoid... roads are set, this sometimes leads to strange routes and pointless support cases.

We could at least eg indicate it on the Settings screen of our route config functionality if Avoid... roads are active, e.g by changing the button text label from ""Select"" to ""Edit"", and/or by changing the (construction sign) icon color to red or similar.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,De-clutter Drawer menu again,[],"Recent developments have blown up our drawer menu, I suggest before our next release we shorten it again as follows:
1. ""Waypoints"": Delete, now obsolete. This is a sub-function of the Directions functionality only and can now be logically accessed from the nav config screen. In addition, we also have other ways to delete waypoints, e.g. long-tapping them using context menu.
2. ""OSM Live"" clearly is a sub-function of Manage map files, and should be a tab on that screen with no seperate drawer entry.
3. ""Builds"" is a developer functionality and should move to the dev plugin settings only, remove from drawer (even if it is only visible with plugin enabled, it still clutters our drawer)

I think implementing these will not only shorten our drawer menu again, but also sort access to our functionality in a more logical way, and optically create a ""cleaner"" and simpler look for our UI.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Extreme slow search for addresses,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Maps: Netherlands
For some reason the search for major towns is Fast (name list is updated, with every new character that is typed).
For the smaller towns/villages this does not work which is a pain (waiting up to 2 minutes) as those do sometimes happen more often. Also ZIP code search is extremely slow, while this should also be easy for the same method as the mayor towns. 
And off course the overhead of looking up the list once and index it, or create an alphabetically sorted derivative is faster when info is requested.
Getting an incomplete Zipcode will be a real pain if the wrong one is chosen from a list, as the search needs to be redone, for each attempt.)

Only the second update makes sense (It is dated 29th December 2015).
But what is the first update?? There cannot be a ""00"" date!

Even after both updates, the ""Last map change"" status has not changed.

The same is true the other way round if you activate an active region (with green overlay) you have a button ""Download"". It would be much nicer to have a deactivate option here.

If you are online and select a deactivated region there is a check for updates of the map and for inactive maps it is offered to ""Download"" or ""Delete"" them, but not to activate them. If the deactivated map is out of date ""Update"" and ""Delete"" are offered. In both cases the ""Activate"" option would be nice to have.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Using webp for all res images?,[],"Osmand apk with last releases inflates rapidly. :(

I've checked latest release apk contens and it looks like it carries several screenshots in webp format, therefore I conclude OsmAnd is able to recode webp images.

But most of images are stored as png. As an experiment I tried to recompress them as webp in lossless mode:

```
shopt -s globstar
for f in **/*.png; do
    cwebp -lossless  -o ""${f%.png}"".webp ""$f"" && rm ""$f""
done
```

Uncompressed res directory size was reduced by 6MB:

```
$ du -sb osmand_*/res
17163415        osmand_png/res
11262620        osmand_webp/res
```

However it looks like png images are compressible a bit, so in zip archive space savings is just 4 MB:

```
$ ls -1s osmand_*/res.zip
17484 osmand_png/res.zip
13656 osmand_webp/res.zip
```

Switching to lossless webp for resources seems like an rather easy and effective optimization for me.

But what fails regularly is the assignment of he correct village/town/city to places where only a street name resolution is possible (i.e. no house numbers in OSM, or nearest house numbers too far away from the point tapped): See screenshots below as an example, but this happens very frequently: The screenshot with the house number assigns the correct place name (Au-Haidhausen is the correct part of Munich [though not the postal address, but that's another issue]), while tapping on a nearby place in the same street where no house number is resolved produces ""Dachau"", a town about 20 miles away where also a street by the same name happens to exist.

But when OsmAnd places a marker on the map, it only records only the location(a); and not the direction of our camera (b).

This detail is critical when we don't remember the place well.

**Desired:** The marker for any type of notes must have a direction-pointer, which points in the direction the camera was pointed at. 

This will also allow us to stand in one place, turn around, and take multiple snaps; thus capturing all details in all directions. Then the markers will tell me which photo records which direction. 

This applies to even the audio notes, because we are usually facing the object while talking about it. So the phone usually points to that object.

My method is to pass through a new area, and take photos with OsmAnd.
Then return home, and look at the details of each photo, and then create POIs.

Usually each photo gives me several POIs (shops that are vertically stacked on different floors).  
So I have to zoom in different parts of the photo and look at the details.

But OsmAnd's native photo viewer is too small for this purpose. It also does not allow me to zoom in. That's why I prefer to watch the photos in an external app (e.g. Google Photos).

But OsmAnd does not allow me to open all my photos directly with this app.

So every time I end up wasting one click.
1. On map, find the photo marker, and tap on it.

Note: ""ул."" is abbreviated from ""улица"" [ulitza], meaning ""street"" in Bulgarian. So, ""ул."" is same as ""str.""
Some streets in Bulgaria are named in the following manner:
name=""ул. Победа"", which means ""Pobeda str.""
In German is common ""straße"" to appear at the end: Kreuzstraße

So, somewhere in the Search function there is a filter, which truncates street names from OSM starting with ""ул."" , but this filter truncates first 4 letters, assuming (but not checking!) that 4th letter is a space.
For some weird reason in some names space between ""ул."" and the actual street name is missing like:
""ул.Победа"". (Yes, there is no consistency in the naming of streets)

On map window that name is shown in full : ""ул.Победа""
But in Search function same is shown like : ""обеда""

Removing ""ул. "" from street names is a good feature, but should be done more carefully.

One suggestion: remove ""ул."" (3 characters) and after that remove leading spaces if any.

They have reported only 1 cosmetic issue so far: When the context menu comes on, the blue button with the ""Direction"" icon in it does not display on the top right corner of the context menu, but instead on the top right corner of the map screen (obstructing the right column of the map widgets there).

And we can create new POIs in large numbers with this simple method:
1. As we pass through a new area, take photos as notes attached to specific location.
2. Later on look at each photo, and convert it into one or more POIs.

Over the past months, I have used this technique and created a lot of new POIs.
But this procedure has a major limitation: It requires us to do the roaming and shooting ourselves.
No person would be able to roam far and wide to capture photos in this manner.

The solution is to allow us to import geo-tagged photos taken by others.

Now any user can import photos taken by himself and his friends; and convert them into POIs.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Feature request: Fuel economy routing,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have""), Label(name=""Offline Routing"")]","It would be nice to have fuel based routing.

This would require the following changes:
- Adding a path-cost calculation based on fuel-time-ratio (more on that later). But I suspect most of that code is already in place since we can choice between distance-cost and time-cost routing.
- Ability to add speed / fuel-consumption at different speeds in the settings. (Linearly blend for speed-fuel points that have not been set.)
- Ability to set breaking cost (hybrid cars have reduced breaking cost) (Might wish to disable this item for now if OSM doesn't take into account deceleration, stop signs, lights etc...)
- As a result of the request above, ability to select different vehicle profiles, in case they use 2 or more vehicles.
- Slider in the route visualization to change fuel/time ratio.
- Ability to set max-speed (to limit speed on highways, due to fuel considerations). This setting would also be useful for vehicles that have a technical speed limit !!! : such as scooters, and light EV vehicles.

About the fuel/time ratio:
The most fuel economic mode for a lot of vehicles is driving at (I think) ~40 km/h, of course travelling at this speed is not realistic. As such the fuel-cost VS time-cost ratio slider is required. What it should do, is linearly blend the speed-cost and the fuel-cost routing. So if the slider is set all the way to fuel side, you get a ~40hm/h route. If it's all the way to speed side, you get the identical result as if you picked fastest route routing.

In rough pseudo code:

```
//Calcs the routing cost of a piece of road
getSegmentCostEconomy(){
     global fuel_time_ratio;
     float time_cost = this->getSegmentCostTime();
     float fuel_cost = this->getSegmentCostFuel(); // <- Actual fuel cost calculation goes here
     cost = fuel_cost * ratio + time_cost * (1-ratio);

1. OsmAnd provides no visible/audio hazard warnings at junctions, where incoming traffic can suddenly appear in front of the driver at high speeds.
2. At junctions, the driver should be warned to avoid the lanes closest to the merging side lane.
   OsmAnd does not do this.
3. The top bar often shows only a manoeuvre (such as U-turn icon), but does not show the road's name.
4. OsmAnd often fails to snap the route to the road. The route line often jumps across roads. 
5. Often a flyover/underpass has exit lanes just before it. In such cases, OsmAnd does not direct the driver to take the proper lanes.
6. Before exiting from a road, we have to change lanes. But OsmAnd does not guide the driver to execute this lane-changing operation well before the exit comes up. Changing lanes at the last minute may be dangerous!

For example, Bangalore has many roads where there is the main road, flanked by a service road; and a stilt (elevated) road overhead. All three roads run in parallel, almost overlapping. But each road has a different set of junctions with the other roads.

In such situations, OsmAnd often shows the current position on the wrong road, leading to wrong directions ahead. Worse, it suddenly corrects itself, and snaps to a different road. The directions again change abruptly. This makes driving extremely unpredictable and dangerous.

**Desired:** Allow the user to long-press on the blue circle/triangle (which shows the current location), and trigger a context menu, which tells OsmAnd which road we are on. After that, it should stay snapped to that road, and not snap to a different road.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"In search by name mode, OsmAnd ignores the distance criteria; cannot set it manually",[],"When OsmAnd is in ""Search by name"" mode, it ignores the distance limit, and finds matching POIs from much longer distances. 

This is undesirable, because we are looking for a _local_ POI; not a namesake POI from a neighboring city, state or country!

Desired: OsmAnd must respect the distance limit.

Also, if we edit/change the search string, OsmAnd does not reset the search distance. For example, suppose that I was searching for _string_1_, and have expanded the search range to <500 km. Now if I change the search string to _string_2_, OsmAnd will search for this new string, but it will not reset the search distance to <1 km: It will launch this new search in <500 km area directly.

For example, take the real life examples of  ""Sarjapura"" and ""Sarjapur"";  ""Maruthi"" and ""Maruti"".

This forces us to search repeatedly, using different combinations of letters and spellings as trial and error, but with no guarantee of success.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Proposal: Separate the add POI to route screen,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","This is in connection with the new proposed layout of ""Route Editor"".

I was looking for any possible hickups in that new design, and found this:
Currently the **Waypoints list** screen allows us to see POIs and favorites.
Then the selected points are added to the route.

Well, this approach needs a clean up too.

I remember that the core idea was to use this while we are already driving along a route.
In that case, this feature was supposed to show us the POIs that we need quickly, and without getting distracted from our driving.

For example, while driving, we get hungry, and look for a POI that provides food (restaurant, store, cafe, anything!)
But we also realize that we don't have cash, so we look for the nearest ATM along the way.
And all this must happen without our grappling with our phone.

Also, once we make our selection, the display must go away.
(Keeping this panel on would distract the driver.)

In short, this is the counterpart of another feature: ""The next segment is blocked. Find me an alternate route!""
Both these features are needed while we are driving, and should be available when needed.

In other words, this dialog is not meant to be used when we are planning a route.
During this phase, we should be using the newly proposed ""search and add"" option.

Also, as we drive along a route, this feature should keep finding POIs of the selected type(s).
But once we select a particular POI, it also means OsmAnd should stop looking for more POIs.

With that logic, I propose the following changes in this feature:
1. Remove it from the ""Route Editor"", and present it directly on the main screen
2. It should be visible during navigation mode only.
3. User should be able to switch it on easily (provide a gesture/button during navigation mode)
4. An audio alert should tell the driver about the next approaching POI/favorite.
   e.g. ""Next gas station 400 m ahead, on left.""
5. If the user ignores it and passes it, OsmAnd should pick the next one along the route.
6. When the user makes up his mind to approach a particular POI, he would double-click anywhere on screen.
   Immediately OsmAnd should add that POI to the route, and recalculate the route.
   It should also toggle the feature off.

1. It does not show the distance along the route (naturally, because the route is yet to be calculated)
   Even if it were to show the distance along the route, this information would not be useful to the user.

Thus, this column can be eliminated in the present design.

In fact, in my proposed layout of the **Route Editor** GUI, I had included the distance column.
But now I have realized that it has no value. 
Therefore I propose that it should be dropped in the future design too.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Proposed layouts for the ""Route Editor"" dialog","[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Hi

Currently OsmAnd uses multiple dialogs to manage the points (start point, waypoints, destination).
The whole Information Architecture is very intricate and confusing for the average user.

Further, the **From** and **To** points are defined in a rigid manner; and are not interchangeable.
This creates further complication.

I propose to eliminate this complexity, and use a single dialog called the **Route Editor**.
(see attached file, which contains two _separate_ alternative designs).

All operations can be carried out in a single place:
- Adding points
- Giving meaningful names to the points
- Shuffling their order manually
- Automatic route optimization (""door-to-door"" sorting)
- Deleting all selected points in one stroke. 

Note that I created the diagram just to illustrate the idea. So I left out some buttons (e.g. Navigation mode, settings,). It is easy to visualize them, though.

I personally like the second proposal, because it is much simpler. 
Yet it is more intuitive in visualization of the route. 
Plus, it can swap the start and end points very easily; thus creating the path for the return journey.

- when tapping on objects on the Favorite, POI, or Downloaded Regions layer or other overlay layers
- (and of course when tapping on a results item on a search result screen, or the ""Show on map"" button there)

But we use long-tap to bring up the context menu for locations which are not objects of any overlay layer.

To the normal user not thinking about ""layers"" this is not obvious and awkward!

I guess we would produce a much snappier app handing if we abolished long-tap and made it all short-tap?

(It may also be a necessary unification if we ever wanted to combine to show address location and POIs around a selected (by short tap :-) ) map location in one multi-selection menu). We better think about creating a new handling now with te context changes we put in r2.2, rather than changing again later.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Leave address and location search only via ""Show on map"" - Let's temporarily fix for 2.2",[],"On the Search address and Search location screen, under some conditions we still show the bottom icon bar displaying icons for ""Directions to"", ""Waypoints"", ""Show on map"", and ""Favorites"".

I suggest that in order to create interim consistency with the rest of our new context-sensitive UI, we delete this icon bar, instead consistently show a ""Show on map"" tick mark (or icon) in the top right corner of the search screen, tapping of which displays the location on the map and opens the context menu for it (exactly like we have it for tapping on any other location data now elsewhere throughout the  app).

The way we have it now, it is very inconsistent: Under some circumstances, we show the tick mark (like when you are on the street search subscreen), but on other occasions we show the bottom icon bar (like when you enter the address search tab from a neighboring search). When exactly we do what is a little unpredictable and actually also depends on the use history of the screens.

I have watched many new OsmAnd users trying to perform one of our main functionalities, the navigation to a street address. And the issue (and inconsistency) of how to leave the search address screen via the bottom icon bar (with icons not known to them) after finding an address/location via Search was the main showstopper they encountered. I think we could make an interim easy fix for this and get the app more in line with our new UI behavior in release 2.2, even before we actually tackle the search functionality later in 2.3.

I got the osmand source to see if I can implement a zip archive, I still get some issues to build but begun to browse the source, I saw that there is an .extra.zip file format, what is it for? there is no comment in code describing the purpose of the file...

I suppose that the entry point of creating an offline tile source is OsmandRasterMapsPlugin::onItemSelected but it seems related only to the plain folder tree osmand tile database... 

this isn't related but I saw a srtm plugin, in which I'm interested (for creating contour lines, slope information layer and some other stuff) what is this plugin for?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Map tiles loading too slow if not in navigation mode,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Sorry for the title, I was not too sure on how to name that. 

When I am opening the map without any navigation just in order to see where I am driving through (as I think that maps real art, I like doing that quite often) the map centres it self by my GPS-location. When driving, the current map tile moves stepwise according to my driving speed which is fine. When I am now driving, say, to the west, I am getting a light grey border of some millimetres on the left side of the screen until it gets reloaded. Not too disturbing but when I am driving, say, to the north west, I am getting two borders of my screen flashing all the time which is kind of annoying and distracting. 

I guess that an easy solution would be to have a map tile of 110 % the screen dimensions loaded all the time which would compensate the moving in any direction sufficiently. More sophisticated and maybe less data consuming could be a preloaded margin as function of the current moving speed. But that would be some more work on programming, I fear. 

Just a ""nice to have"" I would like to share with you. 
Thanks for that great tool and my kind regards!

This issue is the number one issue why currently tapping on so many map locations produces ""Address not yet known"": Because of unnamed bike of foot paths in the immediate vicinity.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Improve GPX navigation with TCX addon,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Osmand has long offered the ability to navigate GPX files.  The preferred GPX file, GPX Track, does not provide street name annunciation.  TCX,  a variant of GPX created for Garmin devices, does provide this information and more.  I propose that Osmand allow the upload of TCX files.

Using a route planning service such as RideWithGPS, a bicyclist or motorcyclist can plan a ride that is then shared with many others through an online service.  The planned event includes a printable cue sheet with turns and street names.  This ride can be exported as a GPX or TCX file.  The TCX file includes the cue sheet as well as the GPX track file.

Adding TCX compatibility to Osmand would provide a dramatic increase in the utility of the app.  It would merge the street name annunciation capability of the main Osmand navigation function with its secondary ability to navigate GPX tracks, but without street name annunciation.  Please consider this as an extremely important upgrade.  

Archived issues have addressed this desired function, but have not correctly identified the problem and the solution.  Adding TCX compatibility will provide the user with the ability to navigate a planned route using street names plus additional words (e.g., rest stop, caution, water) included in the cue sheet development process.

I have taken a look onto my SD card and even deleted the file. Under /storage/external_SD/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files I can only find a file World_altitude_correction_WW15MGH.extra which I have deleted (with no effect to the problem). 

Is there some way to get rid of this behaviour? Thanks in advance!

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Commit POI - OK and Cancel button sizes,[],"On previous versions (10-11-2015) the 'Ok' and 'Cancel' buttons on the 'Commit POI' context (or for example the 'Cancel Route') were big and easy to tap, because they shared the context box available horizontal space between the 2 options (yes or no).

Probably due to the color changes with the recent issue of Android 5.0, the buttons are now smaller,  in the same size as the text they contain.

So in the 'commit POI' context box, the 'Cancel' is bigger, and the 'Ok' is rather small. 
It would be better if they were the same size, as in previous versions, since the 'Ok' should be the primary choice, and the 'Cancel' just in case it was pressed by mistake.

Tapping a spot or POI , opened the spot options, where there was a big blue circle with the 'turn right' signal. 
Taping it would set it as the destination, and proceed to route calculation. Nice and simple.
To add a waypoint, we could choose the desired waypoint location, and tap the smaller 'flag' on the bottom bar.

Now all changed again, the blue circle pops-up 4 more options, like navigate to, set as destination, add as waypoint... But this adds more steps to what was simple.
And tapping the bottom flag (previously to add a waypoint) now sets it as destination?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Showing GPX tracks: speed and/or height,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I really like the feature to show a recorded GPX track and get marks for distance or elapsed time.

What I currently miss is information about speed or height. 

Speed and height may be not so easy to show as distance or time because they are non-monotone, and it's not trivial to decide when to show a mark for speed. When it chanced a certain amount? I have no good idea.

One thing that could work would is color coding speed or height. The color of the track is not fixed, but every segment is colored by according speed or height value. Maybe both height and speed can be visualized, painting the left half oft the track for speed, the right for height. If still a color is needed to tell different tracks apart, an outline of a fixed color could be used.
Something like https://mycarta.wordpress.com/color-palettes/ would be a color palette to differentiate even small changes.

With speed, maybe some filtering is necessary when point distances are in the range of the accuracy. I noted that my phones position solution is sometimes jumping, and as speed is the ratio if distance per time, this could result in jolty speed results. Maybe some smoothing will help in that case, but of course that needs testing.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"New target zoom concept for ""Show on map"" operations",[],"We are in the process of re-working our UI to the effect that tapping any location on e.g. a search results screen (POI, address, favorite, etc.) always first displays the location on the map, then a pop-up bubble offers all possible subsequent actions.

When displaying the location on the map, we always immediately zoom in to a ""neighborhood"" zoom level, arbitrarily set to 15 or 16 for most of our operations. And if the map is already zoomed in further than that we leave it at that zoom.

This is the ""old fashioned"" behavior internet map searches have to apply because they mostly have no history or context of what a user previously viewed or where they are located. Hence when for instance clicking on the ""Where are we"" widget on a hotel web site, the programmer has to make an assumption whether users clicking on that want to primarily see the hotel's neighborhood surrounding, the part of town, or the long distance ""how to get there"" map.

Being a map app, we can do better than that, because we know what the user previously viewed on the map, and can assume that users often first want to see a target location with respect to a previously viewed location (which will often, but not always, be their own location). What I am saying is when e.g. looking for a gas station, a restaurant, or a mountain peak name, users are mostly first interested where something is with respect to themselves (or another previously explored location), and the actual neighborhood view is secondary at most (or irrelevant, like for gas stations or mountain peaks).

As a result I suggest the following:
In our new UI, let us split the process of viewing found locations into 2 steps:
- The first tap on any location search result displays the location on the map at a zoom level such that the last map location viewed by he user (which can be the current position or another location the user previously explored, like a city center) fits on the same map screen. So the first view will be a perspective of the location searched with respect to the previously viewed location. (Almost like we first show the whole route for a newly calculated route).
- If subsequently the user taps on the location title in our new context popup bubble, the map will zoom in to the neighborhood level (say 15 or 16, let us make it consistent), much like we have it today.

This may sound unconventional, but may prove to be a true innovation beyond the old-fashioned ""static"" way of always showing the neighborhood map? And I think it also improves over the classic map search behavior of context-less internet map searches.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Make our map fully interactive,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","**Edit:** See suggestion further below: Rather than what I originally suggested here, I think a great feature for our app would b to make the map fully interactive by having an always-on transparent POI layer. The list-display and selection mechanism for when you tap an area with multiple overlapping POIs is already in place for the POI layer, so WYSIWYG should not be an issue.

As originally reported in Issue #1841:
It would be nice to not only display the street name (finally address), but also see a short list of the say 3 or so closest POIs when long-tapping anywhere on the map, maybe as selection list under the details section of the Context bubble, or similar to how we already have it for the POI layer when user taps an area with several close-together POIs.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Screen power profile,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Although there's a 'Turn screen on [and off]' option that uses the Device Admin to turn the screen off almost immediately after a navigation point, I'd like the option for it to use some of the standard screen power profiles instead - turn screen off as per normal Android time-out (to allow some observation of the app after a navigation point) and the Dim Wake Lock option that allows the screen to dim to a very low level after the normal Android screen time-out (this would be ideal to allow constant use of the app while allowing some powersaving).

Because the screen is coming on at each navigation point, the screen would effectively stay on during lots of navigation.

Along with these power profiles, it would also be nice for the screen turning on automatically to be optional.  The navigation could then be visible for a few mins, then fade or turn off even if more navigation is happening, but audio can continue (if enabled) and if I feel like it I can turn the screen on for a while.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Turn screen on,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","This option has the sub-text 'Turn on device screen (if off)...'

Firstly, this needs expanding to include that it also turns the screen off.

Secondly, for me (probably because OSMAND is on the SD Card), it keeps loosing the Device Administrators privilege.  When OSMand is started (or navigation starts) with the 'Turn screen on' option turned on, it should check this privilege is set and warn with the option to jump to the Device Admin screen.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Failed to load 'Qt5Core' on 2.2.0 10106D nightly,[],"Hey,

I'm running a nightly on my maguro with CM11 and noticed that starting car navigation crashes often with the following error. I also noticed these crashes on previous nightlies.
It seems to happen only when starting navigation from a high-detail map view (e.g. 'world map' view) and then switching to the car view mode (which happens automatically due to the start of the navigation) where many details are hidden.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Context menu: Some remaining issues with Favorite operations,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Issues found as follows:

(1) When CREATING a new favorite, the ""Replace"" button is very visible on the top of the dialogue, while the ""Save"" button is elsewhere, much less visible on the top of the screen. Both need to be moved next to each other (suggest top of the dialog, as top of the screen moves outside the visible area when the keyboard appears, which is also awkward).

(2a) When EDITING a favorite, a slightly different problem exists: The ""DELETE"" button is on the top of the screen, and not visible any more after the keyboard pops up.

(2b) Also when EDITING, any changes to the text fields (like the name) become immediately effective when tapping the devices back button or even just tapping the map (unlike for all other operations where we usually have a ""Save"" button). I suggest (2a) and (2b) need to be fixed consistent with (1): Move all operation buttons to one obvious place (like top of the dialog), and make sure it remains visible even when the keyboard is up. 

(3) Side note: Many users miss the confirmation buttons for dialogues on the top of the screen, the Waypoint dialog is another notorious example. The little confirmation tick mark appearing in the top right corner of the screen after e.g. removing some waypoints (via the ""Edit"" then ""X"") is often overlooked, so users tap the device's BACK key instead, and silently loose their deletions, and wonder why. Not sure yet how to fix, it seems like an intrinsic weakness of the new UI. Maybe we need a popup confirmation dialog asking whether to apply the savings if a users made edits on any of our new screens screen then leaves without saving them!

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Current open issues with the new context menu,[],"Open issues, as a reminder or us:

(1) Tapping the Waypoints button (can easily occur accidentally) will  immediately and without further confirmation set a waypoint (which is comparably cumbersome to remove again). All other actions we have correctly require a second tap for confirmation, and this must also be implemented for setting a waypoint. I suggest we re-instate the old interim menu asking for confirmation to replace the destination, or add as first or as last waypoint.

(2) The ""..."" menu should also contain an item ""Show POI description"", because currently how to display the e.g. Wikipedia or other POI descriptions is very hidden.

(3) Has ""Navigate from"" been deleted on purpose? (Another possible candidate for the ""..."" button)

(4) If possible, it would be nice if (e.g for residential addresses) the city/town/etc. could be shown below the street name, not just the LatLon.

(6) Tapping near a named road, but with an unnamed e.g. pedestrian or bike trail next to it (between the tap mark and the road) will result in the road name not being displayed. We could think about ignoring unnamed lines and instead displaying the named road name if it is close enough to the tap mark.

(7) It would be nice to not only display the street name, but also see a short list of the say 3 or so closest POIs as a selection list under the details section.

(8) Tapping the Share button currently FCs OsmAnd.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Some remaining issues with our Download screens,[],"We have made great progress with our new ""Download indexes"" UI, for documentation here are some remaining issues I still observe:

(1) On the ""Updates"" tab, we should, just like we already do it on the ""Local"" tab, add the country name of any list entry which represents a country's sub region. E.g.: Local tab shows ""Italy Lazio"", which is good, but the Updates tab only shows ""Lazio"", which should be improved. 

(2) We somehow lost the ability to Deactivate /Activate hillshade, contour line and Wikipedia files (on the Local tab, of course)

(3) Order of group categories on the Local tab: Proper order should be (consistent with All Downloads tab):
  (a) Standard maps (is ok)
  (b) Standard maps - Deactivated   (TODO: now here we have Contour lines - Deactivated, if you have any)
  (c) Online and cached tile maps (is ok, but hillshades are also shown here, do we want to change this?)
  (d) Contour lines (is ok)
  (e) Wikipedia (is ok)
  (f) Voice prompts (TTS, preferred)
  (g) Voice prompts recorded) (this is now still swapped with f above)

(4) Local tab: On smaller screens longer group category headlines like ""Standard maps - Deactivated"" are truncated because we only allow one line. We must either allow multiple lines, or we could simply put all deactivated items into one group category called ""Deactivated"", and distinguish them only by their icon.

(5) The group category headline ""Online and cached tile maps"", unlike the other groups headlines does not show the total size used (in MB  GB, etc.),  we should add it.

(6) OsmAnd force-closes when the screen is rotated while on any of the tabs.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,SDCards are not working with OSMand,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","I am having issues with getting OSMAnd to use my SDCard for data storage. It worked on my android 4.4, but after my upgrade to my Z5 that is running 5.1.1 its not anymore. It defaults to: 
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/ which is the internal storage of the phone which i DON'T want to use since I already have a lot of mapdata on my SDCard from the S5. 

However I get a an error that OSMAnd can't write maps files to the folder when I try to change it to:
/storage/(name of SDCard)/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/ which was the folder that OSMAnd used to use. 

I have been googling the issue and when Android 5 was released THAT was the intended behaviour, google however has since then readded SDcard security into the system so that individual apps can ask for permissions to have access to certain folders. It works by popping up a file manager and asking the user to select the root folder that you want to grant access to on the SD card, and any folder further down that particular branch is what OSMAnd would get access to. 

OSMAnd however doesn't do this and it should, as the latter is the new intended behaviour and how its supposed to be so that people like me can use their actual SD card and not phone internal memory.

More on the issue can be found here:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Offline Address Search: ability to search in all the active maps needed,[],"Dear sirs,
recently, I noticed that National map for my country (Italy) is no more available.
I think this is because the package has grown in size so that it cannot be easily  handled anymore, so I'll have download a set of regional maps to cover the territory, instead of one large package .

There is a big limitation in this solution: address searches can be made only on a certain map, which requires one to know exactly in what region is located the searched address. 

Until a few days ago, the problem was solved by using National Address lists, and it worked fine, unfortunately also address files have disappeared from the servers, so that searching for an address can be very difficult now (just an example: try searching for a village named ""Valle Superiore"" among all the 20 regional maps of Italy... without using Nominatim service, of course; personally, I believe that any user would resign soon)

I think that an alternative solution should be implemented if address files are not used anymore, such as extending offline address search to ALL the maps which are in ""active"" status in the device, or maybe locally build an address list from the ones included in installed maps.

Best regards,
Max - Italy

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Road only maps does not cause green fill at zooms 5-6,[],
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Android - Add POI - suggestions to improve usability,[],"I'm using Android version, and I do add POI while driving (not advisable, I know), but I'm not the only one doing this ;)

With the current night build, I have to follow these 10 steps:
1 - long press the spot on the map, that opens the 'spot options' (I don't know the correct name, or how to call that menu)
2 - tap the 3dots,
3 - choose 'Add POI'
4 - tap the name value to open the virtual keyboard
5 - write the name
6 - tap 'back' phone button to return to the context menu
7 - tap the 'POI Type' value to open the virtual keyboard
8 - write/choose POI type (i know what I want to write, it's easier than going through the categories list)
9 - tap 'Send' virtual button
10 - tap the map screen to get that 'spot options' menu out of the way, to see the map again

So if the process of inserting a new POI is made easier, it will be better for us all.
Those 10 steps are a nice number, but could be made simpler.
Previous versions were simpler in menus, but we had to scroll some, and that doesn't help either.

So for start:
Suggestion on step 1 - make the 'Add POI' readily available on the 'spot options', right after the long press. 
Please mind that I do realize that not every user is going to need the 'Add POI' function, so to be fair, I understand if this option stays away hidden under the 3dots sub-menu, even though it would really make my life easier (and all other mappers) if it was readily available at step 1, we would skip 2 steps in the process.
More so, because with the 'spot options' sliding from the left side (current night build, using the phone in landscape mode), there is a lot of blank space unused in the menu.

Suggestion on step 4 - when we choose to Add (or Create) a new POI, the POI editing/adding context opens up, with the name=value blinking the cursor, but we still have to tap on it, in order to open the virtual keyboard, so that we can type the name.
Since most of the phones are Touchscreens without real keyboards, could the virtual keyboard be already opened when the 'edit/add POI' context pops-up?
That would have the same use, but we would need one less click to be able to write the 'Name' value, since the virtual keyboard would already be opened and ready for typing.
That would skip another step in the process.

Suggestion on step 6 - Following the 'make things easier' line of thought, and to make the insertion faster (as I sugested in #1439 ), when adding the 'Name' value, with the phone placed in landscape mode, there used to be a virtual button to click 'Next' (and it would go to the POI_Type) that is now replaced by a 'Send', but this is not good, since we first need to insert a 'POI Type' to be able to send a valid OSM POI information.
The 'send' button is great in the 'POI_Type' value, but the 'Name' value should maintain the 'Next' button.
In portrait mode, that 'Next' or 'Send' button is placed at the bottom right corner of the virtual keyboard, very handy to speed things up, but same as landscape mode, only needed to be a 'Next' when writing the Name value, and 'Send' when inserting a POI_type value, and it would just be excellent.
That would skip another 2 steps in the process.

Suggestion on step 10 - after tapping the virtual 'Send' button (step 9), I'd like to return straight at the map view, If i'm navigating, I do like to see the map.
The chosen spot itself can still maintain the orange/brownish circle/teardrop, as if the user needs to use it again, he just has to tap it.
The 'spot options' menu is huge, sure is nice to be able to tap with fat fingers, or even a trembling phone on a rolling car, but since it has been used to 'Add POI', the menu could be out of the way, it doesn't need to stay opened and occupying more than half the screen.
That would skip another step in the process.

So, after all this, the 'Add POI' could be made in just 6 steps:
1 - long press the spot on the map, that opens the 'spot options'
2 - choose 'Add POI', virtual keyboard opens up ready to type
3 - write the name
4 - tap 'Next' virtual button to go to 'POI Type' value,  virtual keyboard stays open, ready to type
5 - write/choose the POI type
6 - tap 'Send' virtual button, and it's done!
with the menu out of the way, we are back at the map view.

Hope I have made some sense, sorry if I didn't use the correct designations for any menu/option, but I think this is understandable.
Most of the suggestion are also appropriate for the 'Modify POI' context, since it's basically the same. 

Cheers and keep up the great work! :)

after installation. Disabling external storage allows for better app sandboxing

restriction.

I've experienced 2 issues with OsmAnd while trying to do this:
-   External storage read/write permissions are required on the first app run.
  This is ostensibly due to some sort of first-run initialization that
  assumes external storage access (see the logcat output below). Once
  internal memory is set as the OsmAnd storage location, the app can run
  successfully without the external storage permission.
-   Using the ""External storage 1"" directory (e.g.,
  `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/`) does _not_ work
  whenever external storage access is restricted. However, access to this
  directory should be free via [`Context.getExternalFilesDir()`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getExternalFilesDir%28java.lang.String%29) on
  Android 4.4+ (see https://source.android.com/devices/storage/#permissions
  for details).

Here's the error I'm seeing when running for the first time (with storage
restricted):

Actually you can find highway=rest_area , when you are using OsmAnd for navigation on highways.

In Germany, Austria, etc. there is a big difference between ""rest area"" where you cannot eat and refill fule and a ""service area"" where you can eat and get fuel too. 
These ""service areas"" are called ""Raststätte"" (highway=services) , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_area#Germany_and_Austria.

I'd like to request to add the ""service areas""/ ""Raststätte""/""highway=services"" to the default list of POIs in Osmand.
So you would be able find the nearest service station for refueling and food when driving on a highway.
It would be nice to have this visible also, when you select POI category

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,night builds - widget for recording 'Audio' note disappears,[],"Also reported here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/QcLJlD2fkHI

Hi, in the latest night builds, the recording widget (in the right side, top bar widgets) sometimes just disappears. It shows up again on app restart.

So, if it disappeared, once I choose a spot to record an audio note, long press to get the menu, ""record audio note"", it starts and says to press the widget to stop recording, but there is no visible widget.

Bug still ocurring in today night build.

Discovered that the ""Record Note Widget"" shows up as expected when app starts, but if the phone (and screen) is rotated, it disappears instantly, and only shows up again after Exiting and restarting the app.

To repeat the bug:
I'm using the night builds.
Enable plugin for Audio/Video notes.
Choose ""Audio"" as the default for note recording.
A new widget with a microphone symbol and the word ""start"" shows up at the top right bar (along with the speed, distance, altitude, etc).

Rotate the phone (UI and map rotate accordingly).
The mic ""start"" widget disappears.
It only shows up again after Osmand close and restart.

If a phone call is received while navigating, the widget also goes away.

I've downloaded various versions to test this issue, and checked that it only happens after v2.2.0#11879M from 2015-07-03, this is the last night build that the widget works as expected (not disappearing).

At lower speeds tire noise (assumed linear to speed) and engine RPM  (possible surrogate acceleration) will be more significant than wind noise but I assume the volume adjustment would be most important  for speeds where the wind noise prevails.

Adjustment should be probably disabled if music is playing, it is safer to assume that music volume was manually adjusted.

Also realized that many (most?) devices have a microphone which could be in theory used to estimate noise level.

I still do not understand why in the phrase ""onto 'Market Square'"", the internal command is 'street(p,"""", """", ""Market Square"")' (market square as 3rd argument to street()).
In the phrase ""onto 'Bridge Avenue'"" the internal command is 'street(p, ""Bridge Avenue"")' (Bridge avenue is first argument).
What is the difference? It seems to me the 2nd argument is road ref, first could be the street name. 3rd could be the destination (something a bit away, not current street/road). But these assumptions are not true at these commands, and also at the ""onto 'SR 80'"" (it looks like a ref, but is used in 1st argument). So what are the rules?

Also I'd like if there was an example using e.g. bearLeft() including a street name. I don't know how the street name is used, in which context. Is it the street on which you should be keeping left, or is it the one where you get after you turn left (bearing on left before that)?

It seems that the intersection of Sundance dr and Sentinel dr in Fremont, CA, USA is problematic for navigation (I am using offline maps and offline navigation). OsmAnd appears to refuse to make a left turn from Sundance to Sentinel (or right turn in reverse) in some situations.

**Case 1: Going to Sentinel dr from anywhere south-west from it**

Let's pick a random destination, for example this one. The precise location is not critical, it happens from pretty much anywhere.

![source](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091368/555a18ea-62ef-11e5-979d-cca2f1b32e57.png)

And then choose to go somewhere on Sentinel dr a little bit to the north from this intersection. Notice that the suggested route refuses to take Sundance dr even though it is obviously shorter:

![destination](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091364/3e0b8142-62ef-11e5-98cc-d6d0db20af23.png)

**Case 2: Force a via point on Sundance dr**

If I try to force the route to go through Sundance dr by adding an explicit via point, the navigation actually does not reach the destination - it stops at the intersection!

![viapoint](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091414/df26cfb4-62ef-11e5-8582-3c0cf6f15e8f.png)

**Case 3: Going further up on Sentinel dr**

My thinking at this point - maybe the vector information in the map is wrong and somehow the intersection does not connect the two streets. This is not true. If I move the destination just a little bit further north on Sentinel dr, suddenly the route is picked correctly.

![destinationup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091428/1a51dd0e-62f0-11e5-9137-e5feec23d87b.png)

**Case 4: Going in reverse from Sentinel dr**

The reverse routing also does not like this intersection. If I choose to from the destination in case 1 to roughly the same source in case 1 (see the next screenshot), I end up with a route that avoids Sundance dr.

The reverse destination:

![reversedestination](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091466/a497aa48-62f0-11e5-8212-0ba4a0a56669.png)

The resulting route:

**Case 5: Force a via point on Sundance dr in the reverse direction**

If I add an explicit via point on Sundance dr, then the navigation picks up the correct route through Sundance dr.

**Case 6: Going from further up on Sentinel dr**

The interesting part is that if I try to move the source up north on Sentinel dr to the point where the forward navigation worked correctly (case 3 above), the reverse navigation still does NOT pick Sundance dr and I have to force the route to go through it using a via point.

![reversesourceup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091522/52d71b20-62f1-11e5-8c1d-7cd2999e0e09.png)

**Case 7: Going from even further up on Sentinel dr**

If I move the source point further up north on Sentinel dr, then the navigation picks up Sundance dr without any issues and I do not need to use a via point to force the correct route.

**Summary**

Bottom line - it looks like the navigation system does not like this intersection. Even though the map does allow turning through that intersection, the navigation logic avoids it depending on the exact location of the source/destination on Sentinel dr.

As a validation, I tried going between the same points on openstreetmaps.net using OSRM navigation and it found the correct route (through Sundance dr) in both directions without any issues.

I suggest that if the destination is the next thing on the directions list, then IF it's more than x meters away (you decide the limit), announce ""arrive at your destination after x meters"", and if it's closer, don't announce anything and only announce the arrival when it happens. For example, if the destination is 20 meters after the last turn, you'll have arrived before the voice has finished saying ""arrive at your destination after 20 meters"" and it would be better if the voice waited until you actually arrived at your destination and announced only that.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Folow current position since start,[],"**Wish:** add setting to automatically start the app in ""follow position"" mode, without the burden to press the relative button at every start.

**Rationale:**
I mounted an android phone in my car in such a way that, when I turn the key, the phone boots and osmand starts, when I turn off the car, osmand closes and the phone goes off. The phone is fixed on my dashboard and is dedicated to the car.

Now, when osmand is started, the first thing it displays is its starting menu with a few large buttons. I have a script installed in the phone which automatically presses the ""back"" button after x seconds since boot, so that it automatically closes this menu and have osmand show my map.
But when this happens, osmand does not automatically follow my car position as I wander around the town, instead, it statically keeps showing some other area of the map around me and there it remains.

If I manually tap the ""follow"" button (or however it is named) on the lower right hand of the screen, osmand correctly follows my vehicle as I move. But this is a behavior I'd like to achieve automatically, without having to manually tap my phone whenever I start the engine.

Is it or would it be possible to implement such a setting to automatically follow the current position as soon as osmand is started? After all it's just a simple option, definitely self-explanatory for all users and it would make osmand more flexible for people requiring more flexibility :)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Feature request : keep screen on when near a crossroad,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","I've started experimenting with the ""Wake up screen near a crossroad/direction change"" (or whatever it's called in english), and I find it very handy to save up battery, especially during long highway trips.

However, when driving in the city center, I often end up in the following situation : as I approach a crossroad where I need to turn, the screen would turn on to show me the way. However, if there's a red light at the crossroad, the screen would sometimes turn off again (after timeout), and when the red light turns to green, I sometimes can't remember precisely what road to take (imagine a very complicated crossroad in an unknown city during peak traffic, and you'll get the idea).

So here are my suggestions to avoid this situation :
- either keep screen on when _near_/within range (= in distance, not just time) of a crossroad/direction change
- or simply keep screen on when immobile. After all, it's one of the best time to check your map. :-)

Both those changes could also come in handy if there's an unexpected stop/heavy slowing on the way, like a construction area, or an accident. Having the screen on at that moment could allow you to more easily pick an alternative route.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,crashes when clearing waypoints,[],"happens both with the nightlies as well as current f-droid version.

How to trigger:
1 select destination, wait for route to appear, add a waypoint
2 finish navigation
3 clear destination point (which should supposedly clear all intermediate waypoints) but the waypoints are still displayed
4 tap waypoint and (try to) remove it

Apparently in step 3  the waypoints are cleared from one array but left displayed?

An easier (more intuitive way) to clear all waypoints would be nice to have anyway. For example when hitting the ""x"" to finish navigation it could ask me whether I want to have all points cleared.

1. First off all, there is a slight bug in OSM, but that does not change the problem.
   That ramp should be starting a bit further south in real life.
   Instead of splitting off, there is multiple lines.
   From my location there, you can go east (like on the offline routing), change lane and go straight over the overpass.
2. Considering the bug in OSM, routing should be asking me to grab Thickson road a bit  North of my location or going North to Consumers Drive instead of telling me to grab that highway ramp (closest road by distance)

In this case, I am not sure how the routing should handle that... Measure the straight line distance (start to finish) and if routing calculations are way different (lets say 100% over), try to recompute with all directly accessible nearby road within 100m?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,3 suggestions for our new menu structure,[],"(1) I think we should  change the wording ""Home"" in our (drawer) menu to something like ""Dashboard"" (or maybe anybody has a better wording idea), because ""Home"" in a nav system normally has a different association (many people would think of ""Drive home""), and also the ""Home"" screen in Android is already taken for something totally different.

(2) On many 4 inch screens, our current drawer has exactly 1 entry more than would fit on the screen without having to scroll (with dev plugin active). I suggest that the ""Builds"" item does not really need to be on the top menu layer, but we could rather move this to the settings of the development plugin? 

(3) Looks like our ""Start simulation"" item currently only lives at the bottom of the dashboard (if dev plugin is enabled, of course). In my mind it is not a very obvious place to be at, maybe we should actually move this to the dev plugin settings, near where we have ""test voice prompts""?

Result:
Calculated route will use road on way 368690669 which has access=no and OsmAnd should have routed around it.

I changed the road to access=no recently, but I think it is picked up in the map updates because there is also the FIXME that I added at the same time.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,non-existent roundabout announced via voice commands,[],"1. download map of Slovakia (date of 7th Aug 2015)
2. look for junction node 700425 (on Senecka cesta near Ivanka pri Dunaji).
3. put a destination somewhere on Senecka cesta (I am not sure how far that needs to be).
4. put starting point on the opposite side of the junction. I used real GPS position, not sure if that is needed to reproduce it.
5. start navigation

Result:
OsmAnd announces to ""enter a roundabout in X metres"" at that spot (X being only several metres). But that is only in the voice commands. There is no roundabout on the screen and nothing in the ""next turn"" widget. The next turn is the roundabout in Bernolakovo (junction of Senecka cesta and Dukelska), which is far away. So maybe OsmAnd is somehow confusing the distance to the roundabout. Or there is a bug in the voice commands. I used the Slovak voice. I am not sure now if it needs to be the TTS or pre-recorded voices.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Japanese kana displayed as boxes when label starts with a kanji,[],"Context: Most POI names in Japan are a mix of kanji and kana (2 different alphabets). A single Japanese word often uses the two alphabets, for instance 通り (meaning ""road"") is a kanji plus a kana.

Whenever the first character is a kanji (and that's very often), then all following kana characters are displayed as boxes.

As a result, ~50% of the POI names in Japan are corrupt:

![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99590/9631331/1ad5a9b8-51bb-11e5-9032-57086256ce7d.png)

Examples showing how the bug works:

```
漢字ひらがな　→　漢字□□□□
漢字カタカナ　→　漢字□□□□
ひらがなだけ　→　(same)
カタカナダケ　→　(same)
漢字丈　→　(same)
漢字ひらがな漢字　→　漢字□□□□漢字
漢字カタカナ漢字　→　漢字□□□□漢字
通り　→　通□
```

I suspect OsmAnd uses a Chinese font without kana whenever the first character is a kanji. A first workaround would be to use a font that has kana. Another workaround would be to differentiate Japan/China using [this easy formula](http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/80408/1013):

```
106.38 + longitude - 0.666*latitude = ?  Japanese if positive, Chinese if negative

""Turn right on to Stratford Crescent then after 100 metres turn right. The trip is about 7 km. Time is 25 minutes. Turn right on to Stratford crescent then after 100 metres turn right.""

This is a confusing amount of spoken text to hear at the start of the journey with statement duplication.

If I begin navigation before the route has been calculated then I do hear:
""The trip is about 7 km. Time is 25 minutes. Turn right on to Stratford crescent then after 100 metres turn right.""

It would be fine just to hear ""The trip is about 7 km and will be around 25 minutes. Turn right on to Stratford Crescent"" in both cases.

I think that the user-chosen directions Pedestrian mode should be persisted instead of always converting the Browse Map view to Car by default. This would only need an extra variable to save the last used mode to use when starting directions from the Browse Map view.

This is particularly a nuisance when using default Browse Map view and using pedestrian navigation to go from one individual waypoint to the next, as each time the travel mode needs to be changed from Car to Pedestrian.

If I change the view from Browse Map to Pedestrian before directions then pedestrian mode is the initial profile. However, on exiting directions the chosen default Browse Map view is restored then using directions again similarly results in car navigation.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Support for time-condition turn restrictions,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have""), Label(name=""Offline Routing"")]","Greetings, I had to navigate through city using OsmAnd+ and calculated route. I use It daily and am quite happy, but it calculated horrible route in this case:

As it seems, OsmAnd+ does not use time condition on turn restriction relations.

The important relation attributes are hour_on and hour_off, see [the relevant page in the official OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:restriction). Please make OsmAnd+ consider these attributes also and cull accordingly.

I have attached screenshots of the symptoms and with example relation in Vienna, Austria:

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"""roundabout"" announcements improvements",[],"By living in EU (France/Italy), I find the ""prepare to enter"" roundabout announcements totally worthless. There's nothing special about roundabouts compared to a crossing, and in cities you might have an average higher than one per square kilometer, which makes the TTS so noisy I had to turn off announcements.

The exit announcement is good, but there's no need to a ""prepare to enter a roundabout"" warning. Roundabouts are even more prominently marked than a crossing, with slow-down panels as early as 1km in certain cases.

Not only that, but I find the anticipation of the announcement to be completely off. I've had several times ""in 4 km, prepare to enter a roundabout"".

I've worked for a custom a street-nav before, and one of the best solutions we found was to give announcements a time-based anticipation (based on current distance/speed) plus a hard-limit distance (10/50/100/...m depending on the announcemen + GPS acc radius), just to ensure the announcement is not skipped.

I care about regular turning announcements only 100 meters or 15 seconds before the actual turn, whichever is first. There's no need to announce a turn ~50km away just because it's the next turn. I gladly prefer the TTS to stay shut if all I need to do is go straight.

[Another thing we did, to improve the TTS in eu countries, was to detect the angle of the exit turn in roundabouts. What happens frequently is the transformation of a crossing in a roundabout: in this case, you have a large number of 4-exit roundabouts where the exit points are almost at straight angles. When the roundabout has 4 exit, and the 2nd exit is chosen, and the angle from the current segment/exit is <5deg, we replace the accouncment with ""at the next roundabout, continue straight with the 2nd exit""]

I have a situation on my SG Note 4 that the background sleep mode enables itself after closing OsmAnd and stars to record the GPX data.

Is this something normal?

I have the GPX recording enabled but I was hoping if OsmAnd is closed and completely cleared from memory this should not happen until next start ...

What can trigger this kind waking up? any scheduled job that is hiddenly initialised?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,My Places Favourites Sort Order Incorrect,[],"Favourites are now showing incorrectly out of sort order, which is a bit of a nuisance when you are looking for a favourite in a long list in My Favourites in My Places.

In version 1.9.5. of OsmAnd+ on Android favourites displayed in a list were listed in a logical alphanumerical order, with favourites listed first with those starting with numbers 0-9, and then characters A-Z after that.

In version 2.1.1. of OsmAnd+ on Android there are a few problems:-
1. Numbers are sorted after letters, and not first.
2. A name with a number anywhere in the title is now sorted as a number, so for example 'Hotel 257  Main St', is now sorted as if it just said '257'.
3. New waypoints may appear near end of the favourites list even after a force close of Osmand.
4. Alphabetical sorting of names is broken as some new waypoints show out of correct alphabetical order. 

(These problems occur even if you test the very same 'favourites.gpx' file from v1.9.5.)

I hope this will be fixed soon.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,OsmAnd crashes when rotating in simulation mode and sometimes when navigating,[],"I posted this a few days bag in the forum:
Today I was trying the simulation mode of a route with the 2.1.1 OsmAnd+ from the play store. 
I accidentally rotated my phone duringthe simulation and nothing functioned anymore: it was completely blocked. I really had to open the phone and remove the battery.

After starting it up again I very reluctantly tried it a second time. And again: the phone was completely blocked upon rotation during the simulation. Again I had to open the phone and remove the battery.
I used it with a roads-only map. I don't know whether it also crashes with normal maps but I don't even want to try.

Please fix this bug.

E.g. c:geo seems to support this for locus and maps.me. I would love to see this feature together with OSMand somewhen. An according API could of course be used by many apps... 
See https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/5024 as a reference. The linked commit shows, how they use the maps.me implementation of such an interface.

With OsmAnd, these are rendered as missing glyphs. Please see the screenshot below for illustration.

As a consequence, lane numbers cannot be read from the map of Taiwan unless the language is switched to English, which severely limits the usability of the map.

What appears to be the likely cause is that some sort of _Roboto_ font is used to display the labels, and it doesn't have these glyphs encoded, in which case the application should switch to some fallback font, most likely _Droid Sans Fallback_, whenever a glyph is unavailable. (Mind you this is just a guess that might be wrong.)

I would really appreciate to have an option for hiding/unhiding house numbers. On phone, there is a too much information on the map in most cases - when I'm using OsmAnd for car navigation house numbers are sometimes disturbing. 
The same thing is when I walking somewhere, I can find the house before a walk and mark it as a finish point so I do not need to see all those house numbers.
It's nice to have an option to hide building (useful for car navigation) but many labels (especially house numbers) are much more disturbing than buildings.

It would be nice to make house number optional.

On the first screenshot you see the German cities Nürnberg (Nuremberg) and Fürth. Note that Nürnberg is five times as large as Fürth based on population, and the population sizes are properly recorded in the OSM database. The second screenshot shows the same area, but zoomed out. The label ""Fürth"" is shown, but ""Nürnberg"" is missing. 

Presumably there's not enough space on the map for both names, so osmand drops one of them. Clearly, in situations like this, the smaller city's name label should be dropped.

The standard openstreetmap.org map layer has the same problem, but the Humanitarian style does it correctly.

- Providing a hierarchy mechanism to classify categories: a character could be used as a separator to build a directory structure, for instance we could have the following categories : 'NYC', 'NYC/Restaurants' (belongs to NYC category), 'NYC/Restaurants/Brunchs' (belongs to NYC/Restaurants category) and 'NYC/Museums' (belongs to NYC category). This would allow for a user-friendlier interface, wihout having to change the way the Favorites are stored in the file. Of course, it would be even greater to deal with this hierarchy at the XML level in the file, if GPX format allows it.

Please remove the word completely where the tagging is not in combination with a building or an address.

Starting with our nightlies of July 7 and later, on any device, in Android settings disable GPS (Location). The map screen (offline vector maps) will not fully render anymore by itself, after app startup, a zoom operation, etc.. It may partly render, then freeze. If you wait long enough (a few seconds, so the map can get rendered in the background), then touch the map and pan it a little, the map will immediately get fully displayed. So somehow we are missing a final map refresh in newer builds (after the memory leak fix, I guess). Builds of July 6 and earlier did not have this issue. If GPS is enabled, the issue will also not show up. (This is independent of a fix, GPS just has to be enabled.)

osmandapp/Osmand,open,"""Killer feature"" (OsmAnd unique selling point): Provide better low density maps <= 11 zoom","[Label(name=""Nice to Have""), Label(name=""Offline Rendering"")]","I have had this feature in mind for a long time, and think it is now about time we try this, and with it create one more killer feature which promotes OsmAnd over almost any other available mapping app:

As we all know, in general the amount of detail to be shown on the map at close-up zoom levels (say >= 12) needs to be _limited_ to avoid the map screen being cluttered with details. We are doing a fair job here with our ""minzoom"" mechanism, limiting and controlling the amount of detail visible via a variety of high or low detail renderers and switches (like e.g. he ""more details"" switch) for what users may require.

But we have neglected the complementary situation: Some very large areas in the world are rather feature-deprived so we could on the contrary _enhance_ the amount of detail visible there. In order to discover anything at all, you need to zoom out rather far (to view a large enough area to find anything), and the crux is that at these small zoom levels we do not render many details any more. But displaying these features may be very essential for the usability of a mapping app in these areas at all.

Examples of this could be as follows:
- Take an Alpine area. The things you may definitely NEED to see are hiking trails and Alpine huts, even at zoom <=11.
- Take areas like deserts. While there may be no roads, there may be tracks and paths. And there may be springs. You may need to zoom out far enough to find them (maybe to zoom 11 or 10), and it is counter-productive if at such zooms we do NOT render them, instead show and ""empty area""
- Take thinly populated scenic areas like the north of Norway. There may be very few things, and tourists may try to discover things like the polar circle visitor center, a feature we only render if you zoom in rather far, while google maps shows thee things (in the absence of other features) much sooner.

So my suggestion is we find a dynamic mechanism, perhaps along the lines of our existing roadDensityLimityPerTile, to include OSM features in map tiles which would otherwise contain very little detail, at smaller zooms than with our static ""minzoom"" mechanism.

Please note that we would only do this in situations where there is zero issue with cluttering the map, I am talking about areas where we would mostly show an ""empty map"", while there is very useful information ""hidden"" for the user. I am not sure if we would e.g. directly include this information in our base map at lower zoom levels where needed, or if we could e.g. ""extract"" this information from the detailed maps' higher zoom levels and somehow project and display onto the lower zoom levels.

Another note: We do have a workaround for POIs to display them via the POI layer mechanism, so the initial focus for this request could lie with tracks and paths, not necessarily POIs.

  We find that in some cases your app may suffer a long processing delay.

  Case 1:

  **Suggested modification** Use _executeOnExecutor_ method instead.

- users finding one of the ways but not discovering the other one, hence ""missing"" essential e.g. search or filter functionality
- a significant number of support cases
- also more code we have to maintain

POIs or GPX tracks can be placed on the map either via the ""Configure map"" button and a flat list selection screen, or via the dashboard's ""Search -> Show all"" screens, which have more functionality like text filtering, items structured by folders, etc..

I suggest that we abandon the ""flat list"" selection screens, instead tapping on the ""POI..."" or ""GPX Track..."" menu entries in the ""Configure map"" menu must lead to the exact same (full functionality) screen we already have for ""Search -> Show all"". Future development can then concentrate on only these full functionality selection screens (like when we e.g. implement a ""Sort by date"" view of the GPX tracks or similar.

- display all your contacts on map
- easily plot a route between several contacts (like pickup up coworkers when carpooling, or delivering regular clients…)
- finding which friend lives closest to all your others friends :-P
- … and probably many more !

A handy option to that tool : create a favorite category for each contacts group (so that contact in the ""Friends"" group end up in the ""Friends"" favorites category, ""Clients"" in ""Clients"", etc.). I'm not quite sure what to do with contacts that are in several groups, though.

NB :
I know that you can display a contact's address in OsmAnd by clicking on it in your addressbook, but :
- for many people, it doesn't work. See #1402 :-(

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,No speed data,[],"Hello. I'm using OsmAnd 2.1.1 (Android 4.4.2). If I'm using it with my GPS module u-blox NEO-6M I cannot get any data about my speed and the map doesn't rotate in the direction of my movement. I was thinking it maybe a problem in my GPS module because some other GPS navigation apps doesn't provide speed data too (e.g. Navmii). However one of the apps works well - it is Yandex.Maps (Яндекс.Карты). So I can make a conclusion that the input data is correct (I have attached NMEA data). Could you to revise the processing algorithms of the input data?

PS: for comparison, I have attached data that I got when using Nokia E52 (ExtGPS app) + Bluetooth GPS Android app. OsmAnd works well with this input data.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,wish: export/share AV notes with locations as GPX,[],"The AV notes plugin is most useful for collecting OSM mapping information.  If a note (of any sort) is taken while a GPX track is being recorded, it is added to the track as a GPX waypoint;  the position of the note can then be imported into other mapping software, or uploaded to OpenStreetMap, and used as a location.

If an AV note is taken while no GPX track is being recorded - maybe the user is not recording for a map, but just spots an interesting feature - then the note is recorded as before but there seems to be no way to export its position as GPX or in any other format, or even to show its lat/lon position.  It is of course possible to share/export the notes from the My Places - Notes screen, but this only exports the media files themselves and not their position or any other information about them.

Suggest that on that screen there should be two sharing options:  either the selected media files themselves, as now, or alternatively their positions as a GPX file.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Theme change not working without restart,"[Label(name=""Investigating"")]","After updating from OsmAnd+ 2.0.4 (fresh install) to 2.1.1 (all from Google Play store), my standard ""Dark"" theme had mysteriously changed to ""Light"" theme. Hopefully that will not happen for every update now.

Not a problem, so I changed the theme back to ""Dark"", but it only got applied for the ""General settings"" menu, not for ""Settings"" menu and also not for the overlay on the main map screen. I was wondering if I had changed it properly and was going to verify my selection, and now the ""Settings"" menu was ""Dark"" as well. But from this point on, no matter what I did, the overlay on the main map screen stayed ""Light"".

Only when I leave the app (no need to force-kill it but that would do the job as well) and re-enter again, then also the overlay on the main map screen finally gets ""Dark"".

Maybe not a big issue but a little confusing with the mixed ""Light"" and ""Dark"" screens until you leave the app. As a simple work-around there could be a small note on the General settings screen that recommends to restart the app to have the change take effect (a lot of apps do it this way, and I'm totally fine with this).

Also I'm wondering why the theme had changed during the update (2.0.4 -> 2.1.1) and if other settings might have changed as well.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Navigation screen orientation, add a 4th option",[],"I'm often using OsmAnd's navigation function.

![Navigation screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/6q8lI9O.png)
The ""To the compass"" type is not fully what I need, and if I just rotate around 180° it will loose the destination from sight.

In most Navigation applications, I can achieve a mixed solution: to the direction of the movement AND keep the destination in the front of me. Like iGo's, or Google Maps' navigation functions.

Can you add this 4th type of orientation? I don't think 3D is needed, but it is kind of 3D, like in other apps.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Still heavy fast route recalculation problems (loops) with release 2.1.1,"[Label(name=""Observed"")]","Using OsmAnd 2.1.1 second release I noticed the following bug:

Parameters to reproduce
- Make sure maps ""Germany_baden-wuerttemberg_europe.obf"" and ""Germany_bayern_europe_.obf"" are installed
- Start point approximately: 47.682812, 9.759014
- Destination: 47.55081, 9.72054
- Start navigation in car mode
- Against automated directions turn left (not right) at:  47.683419, 9.757061

Note: This is a good alternative ""economic"" route. Other navigation systems - also if in ""fastest"" - mode - recalculate without problem to accept these alternative route after turning left.

Result with OsmAnd:
OsmAnd was heavily busy with recalculating many times. For the half way it wanted to route me back to the motorway. Below you see a screen shot with the ""crazy loop"" OsmAnd wanted me to drive. You can see that OsmAnd suggests to drive 30 km although the correct remaining route at that location would be ~14 km!

(Later - but much too late - OsmAnd has recalculated correctly.)

It is not acceptable to suggest a route with more than twice the length. Since these problems have been introduced with ""fast recalculation"" algorithm I call it a regression.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,access=destination costs in offline routing.,"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi,

when going through stretches of access=destination osmand tries very hard to get you off those streets as soon as possible at a very high cost. It seems access=destination ( and possibly other access restrictions ) simply increase the cost-per-meter on those roads. This is wrong as access=destination allows you to leave or enter that area but not to transit it. Even assigning a cost to enter or exiting it would be wrong. A very high cost for transiting the subgraph of access=destination streets would probably be okay as that would then allow a route of last resort if there is no way around a access=destination subgraph.

So instead of just showing: 1 km, 2 km, 3 km, we would display e.g. 1km (4:52), 2km (9:48), 3km (14:23). In this fashion users do not only see their lap times, but also the total accumulated times, which is useful for joggers, hikers, cyclists, etc.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Add a ""start from here"" option to the address search/favorites/history screens","[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi,

I often use OsmAnd to calculate navigation from point A to point B, which are different from my current position (e.g. when I only need the last kilometer of a road trip, or simply planning my next treck).

In order to achieve this, I currently need to :
1- search for point B (in search, favorites, history, etc.)
2- set point B as destination
3- search for point A
4- show point A on the map
5- tap point A and select ""Start navigation from here"" (or whatever it's called in english)

Not only are step 4/5 one tap too much (""fewer taps is better""), but it's rather counter-intuitive to select your destination THEN your starting point.

Both these issues could be corrected with the following :
1-  Add the ""Start navigation from here"" on the search screen, along with the current ""Go to destination"" or ""Show destination on map"". (That might need a new ""Starting point"" icon on the map though).
2- Once selected, select another address and tap ""Go to destination"".

I believe this simple modification could do wonder to improve the intuitiveness of OsmAnd. :-)

Even better : add a ""current position"" button on the address search that would, well, set the current position (as determined by GPS/cell tower/wifi) as either source (effectively meaning ""Start from here"") or destination (meaning ""Get me back to here (where I parked my car/pitched my tent/buried a body/whatever)"").

"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Massive harmonization of UI list screens,"[Label(name=""Investigating"")]","From talking to many users and discussing what they think needs improving the following issue arises:
OsmAnd is often perceived as extremely complex and awkward to use. One part of it is our feature-rich functionality, let's put that aside for now. But the other part is: We make the optical appearance and the choice of actions too diverse, make things look different which could be the same, and make users guess too often what which icon/ action would cause!  As a result, the learning curve of using OsmAnd is enormously flattened...

Plus: The problem with just having various scattered action icons is that users are unaware or confused by which icons in our UI (mostly on the dashboard, but also on other configuration screens) are clickable or not, and every new or occasional user is clueless about their meaning or what action they trigger.

What aggravates the situation is that we use different ways of presenting icons and actions on completely analogue screens. The following is a partial list, we may find still more measures to rectify the situation:

(1) On the dashboard ""list"" cards History, My Favorites, and My Tracks, the appearance of the list entries is optically different than in the corresponding ""full"" lists (the ones obtained by tapping on ""Show all"". Also the action triggered when tapping the textual list entry, or when tapping the icon to the right of each list entry is different from doing that in the corresponding full list.  I suggest the layout, and the actions triggered must be fully identical, hence
(1a)  On the dashboard card, replace the icons to the right by the ""3 dots"" More icon (just like we have in the full list)
(1b) When tapping either the textual list entry or the 3 dots icon (on any list), we always must produce the textual popup context menu (the one we have on the full lists now). It is fully comprehensive and in textual form, it removes all guessing for first time users or occasional users, and it offers all possible actions a user would expect like Navigate to, Show on map, etc.

(2) Another example: On the Dashboard's Plugin card, tapping on the icon to the left of each entry just brings up that Plugin's title card. But On the ""Plugin / Show all"" total list of Plugins, tapping on the icon to the left of each Plugin entry activates or deactivates the Plugin. Again here: The list entries on both the Dashboard Plugin card and the full Plugin list screen, must look identical, and tapping on an entry should always produce the textual context menu to avoid guesswork and surprises.  Also here I suggest we use the ""3 dots"" appearance on both lists, which brings things in line with what I suggest in (1).

(3) On our Search screen, tab ""History"", we use the ""3 dots"" icon to the right of each list entry to indicate that several actions can be triggered by tapping the icon (or the entry, it is the same, which is fine). But on other search tabs like Favorites or POI the 3 dots icon is missing, should be added, too, for consistency.

(4) On the ""My tracks"" full list, let us create the identical behavior we would now have on all list screens: Tapping an entry will produce the textual popup menu (which so far on that screen you only get when tapping the ""3 dots"" icon for each entry). As it is now, tapping a track entry itself puts you on the ""Track segment"" screen, and I have yet to find a single users who immediately comprehended what happened, and what it can be used for (see (5) below). Instead, the option of getting to that screen should be added as one action on the popup menu entry called ""Track analysis"" or similar.

(5) On the ""Track segments"" screen, which I suggest you get to only via ""Popup/Track analysis"",  let us add the actions currently hidden behind the two icons on the top right corner, ""Share track"" and what we there call ""Show on map"", into the popup menu for the list entries of that screen. The latter action (now falsely hidden behind the top-right Show on map icon) must be renamed to something like ""Split interval"", because ""Show on map"" is already in that menu with its correct action.

Oddly enough, _this_ animal shelter http://osm.org/go/ZQq85BP~M?way=265430471 does show up, but I'm going to assume that it's because of one of the other tags.

Also, at least some POIs that are ""shop=yes"" show up in search results as ""Yes <name of place>"".  They should probably be listed as ""Shop <name of place>"" instead, although I think ""shop"" should be a lower priority tag if something else exists (such as amenity=animal_shelter), but that's open for debate.

When I tried changing the path icon spacing, nothing changed as well.

All this leads me to the conclusion that these arrows have to be somehow hardcoded, as I whatever I tried would result in the rivers staying the same or disappearing completely. Is it indeed hardcoded or am I doing something wrong here?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,address search now uses unfamiliar English names and doesn't use countries of regions,"[Label(name=""Investigating"")]","In the current version (2.0.4), goig to the address search and tapping ""Region"" brings up the list of all supported regions, as expected.  There are two problems with this, first of all where a country is split up into regions the country name is not prepended to the region, as if I remember correctly was the case in older versions.  For example, I have the full set of France mainland map files installed;  formerly starting to type 'f' 'r' would bring up all of her regions, such as ""France alsace"", ""France aquitaine"" etc. with just typically those two keystrokes followed by a scroll and tap needed to find the wanted one.

Now typing the same 'f' 'r' only searches the bare region names, so it only shows ""Free County"", ""Ile-de-France"" and ""Free and Hanseatic City of Bremen"".  It isn't possible, therefore, to pick a country and then browse its regions.

The second issue is that this search always seems to use the English names of the regions;  it took me a long time to work out that the ""Free County"" above was actually Franche-Comté.  Nobody, not even an English visitor travelling in France, would know it by the English name, and it would not be shown on any signpost or any other documentation - therefore it is pointless using the translated name.

There used to be a setting ""Use English names on maps"" which seems to have disappeared; to my recollection I have never had this option turned on.  Setting the ""Map language"" (I have tried ""Local names"", ""English"" and ""French"") does not affect the search.

Suggest that the searcher should revert to showing the country plus region when appropriate (in some distinguishing format, e.g. ""France - Alsace"" if necessary), and either always use local names or honour the map language setting.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,A few suggestions :),"[Label(name=""Nice to Have"")]","Hi all,

I have a few suggestions/issues from my use of Osmand
(sorry I don't know how to code them or I would've tried)

1.) Cancel a destination after a period of time has elaspsed or the application has been closed for a certain amount of time or the application has been closed. (Alot of the time I don't actually navigate to the desitination but just use it to get an idea of directions, or for mapping issues etc., therefore the route is not cancelled, and there are quite a few clicks required to cancel the route) Other times I may not reach the destination but park nearby or likewise... still have to cancel the route 

Note: People may be travelling a longer route or something with multiple waypoints etc. and as such the app may be closed for a period of time. Maybe leave it in navigation mode or similar until such a time as the user cancels? I'm not too sure

2.) ""You have exceeded the speed limit"" Should become say: ""Speed limit [maxspeed] [units as a word]"" E.g.: ""Speed limit eighty kilometres per hour"". It may be accompanied by a repeating short-ding or similar and repeating ""speed limit XXX"" Current wording is a bit too agressive or offputting. Further there may be an option to adjust when the speed limit warning occurs.

3.) Destination (address) announcement had  the street number (determined by a building in OSM) announced after the street name  it said you have reached you destination (or somthing like that) George Street 4 (instead of you  have reached your destination [pause] 4 George Street (Further announce the localitiy if possible?)

There also may be pedestrian crossing issue:
- re highway=crossing, crossing=unmarked
  being announced when it shouldn't be

I'll investigate once a map edit makes it way through and get back to you

Regards,
aaron

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,waypoint colour not saved/loaded correctly in favourites.gpx,"[Label(name=""Investigating"")]","It is possible to set a waypoint colour in the favourites.gpx file, although the app's GUI only supports setting a colour for folders and there only certain preset colours.  However, if certain RGB colour values are set in the GPX file they are not saved and reloaded correctly between runs of OsmAnd+.

Delete all of OsmAnd+'s ""My Favorites"" and their containing folders, so starting with an empty list.  Then exit the app and save the following file as /sdcard/osmand/favourites.gpx:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?>
<gpx xmlns=""http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"">
  <wpt lat=""48.229336"" lon=""7.406588"">
    <name>Test Waypoint</name>
    <type>Transport</type>
    <extensions>
      <color>#0000ee</color>
    </extensions>
  </wpt>
</gpx>

Then start OsmAnd+ again.  The waypoint will appear in the list and on the map with a blue colour, as expected.

Exit OsmAnd+ and run it again, note that the waypoint and folder colours have changed back to the standard '#eecc22'.  The favourites.gpx file on the device will have changed to:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes' ?>
<gpx version=""1.1"" creator=""OsmAnd+"" xmlns=""http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd"">
  <wpt lat=""48.229336"" lon=""7.406588"">
    <name>Test Waypoint</name>
    <type>Transport</type>
    <extensions>
      <color>#ee</color>
    </extensions>
  </wpt>
</gpx>

Note that the <color> value is truncated.

If this test is repeated with a colour value that will fill up 6 hex digits, for example '#ee0000', it will display correctly (with the expected red colour) within OsmAnd+ and persist properly between runs of the app.

Suspect that the GPX parsing only recognises a full 6 hex digit colour specification, in which case it needs to be written out in a compatible format.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,wish: show road information even when not navigating,[],"Most car satnavs, even when no navigation is in progress, display the current road name and its speed limit, continuously updated.  It would be nice if OsmAnd+ had such a feature too.

Obviously this would drain battery power and hence turning this tracking on should be optional.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Search for ""Closest POI"" now seems to be gone (version 2.0.4)",[],"Some versions ago - possibly before the big rewrite for 2.0 - it was possible to select a point (e.g. press on map -> click on popup -> Search near here) and in the POI search there was an option for ""Closest POI"".  This was useful in two cases:  (a) finding out what a map symbol indicated if the user was not sure what the symbol represented;  (b) if the POI type was not in the default list.

Now this function seems to have disappeared.  The nearest option to it seems to be ""Search by name"", but that will not accept a null string to search on everything and will never find an unnamed POI.

If this function could be restored then it would be much appreciated!

I checked the ""GeoPointParserUtil.java"". Possibly the URL-parsing here is buggy or simply not adapted to the osmand.net URLs.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Critical Error: Favorites with null name,"[Label(name=""Investigating"")]","Here is how to reproduce:
Either rename one of your favorites by just deleting the name (setting it to nothing), or have your favorites.gpx file contain a favorite which has an empty name tag of the fashion <name></name>. Or probably also: Just create a new favorite with empty name.
OsmAnd will, after the next app start, not display any vector maps any more, but just a 'gray' map (raster map overlays or online maps will still be displayed, this issue affects all vector maps only). Upon app start, a toast with text ""null"" will appear.

The issue is critical because the situation is very hard to remediate. Rebooting the device will not help at all. From what I can see the only way out is to re-name (or edit) your 'bad' favorites.gpx file, then completely uninstall and re-install the app to get the null favorite out of the db again.

I have not checked if similar issues exist with maybe empty favorite Category names (upon creation our default now seems to be empty, while I think it used to be ""Other""), empty media notes names, or other conditions which may occur while parsing any xml file (cached OSM edits?), etc.

It would be great if you upgrade your search engine to search in all names of objects (when I type name of the street in English (for Ukrainian city) - I get results (if target street has additional name in English (name:en=*) ).
   Last example: I have been to Israel, and I could not find anything in English, because map gets only Hebrew language.
2. When you seek a city it would be great show additional info in found results (if there are more than one city with that name in your country):
   [Rokitne           ][ Search ]
   Rokitne (Kievska oblast)
   Rokitne (Lvivska oblast)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Use smarter route recalculation strategy,"[Label(name=""In progress""), Label(name=""Investigating"")]","OsmAnd offline routing: Our current strategy of re-calculating only the first 20 km of a route in case you leave a calculated route (miss a turn etc.) has a major pitfall, imagine this:

There is a big lake, swamp, or mountain range. Your destination is pretty much right behind it,  so you have only either the left road around it, or the right road around the obstacle.

Say OsmAnd routes the left road around it, but for some reason (accidentally or on purpose) you take the right road. OsmAnd would continuously route you back onto the left road (which could eventually be a huge detour of 100km), even if you are almost at your destination having taken the right road.

Looks like we need some sort of periodic ""sanity check"" where the overall route is _completely_ re-calculated from scratch. I guess the best is we trigger this if a route had to _repeatedly_ be recalculated (in the case described there would be pretty much continuous re-calculation). Alternative strategies could be we limit the number of partial re-calculations not absolutely but  per time interval.

I used to use OsmAnd on Android 2.3 with no problems.
Now I installed OsmAnd (the latest free version) on Android 2.3.7 (CyanogenMod 7.2.0) but crashes really often, making it unusable!

Before installing it, I deleted it's old settings folder (osmand) and also after installation I ""Moved to SD"" the app.
At first run I downloaded maps, but after that the app crashes almost whenever I open it and ""click"" somewhere...

any suggestions ?

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Audio/ Video Notes Plugin produces bogus menu when triggered via ""Play Bluetooth""",[],"I have to yet figure out what exactly triggers this, I think it has to do with some ""Play media"" event or command, but here is how to reproduce: (I can reproduce this with all kinds of Android devices, but have only one car audio system to play with):
1. Have your Android device paired via Bluetooth with your car audio system
2. Have Bluetooth turned on on both. But turn your car audio to ""Radio"" for now, not to ""Play music from Bluetooth device""
3. Start OsmAnd on your phone. Have it display the map screen, a navigation need not be active, but the Audio/Video Notes plugin must be activated to produce the issue.
4. Now turn the car audio system from say ""play radio"" to ""Play sounds from music device"". (I guess it normally sends some ""play media"" command now to the media player active on your phone, or similar)

It appears that by this trigger, OsmAnd always displays the selection menu ""Take video not / Take audio note / Take photo"".

This is of curse both bogus and annoying, because it interrupts the map display and requires the driver to interact with the device.

I guess this may somehow be triggered by a ""play sound"" command coming from the car audio (via Bluetooth), which OsmAnd falsely interprets to produce this menu. The issue is 100% reproducible, across all my Android devices.

Discussion: OsmAnd gives clear directions for named roads (such as ""Turn left on Northwest Valley View Road."" However it never announces the name of major highways.

Additionally there is similar issue with the favourites. My eisting old favourites file doesn't work in extSdCard folder.
Ok, copied it to the default folder. Neither doesn't work.
Created a new favourite. Gues where it will bewritten to - yes, it goes to my existing old favourite file. The new one will be added to my old ones. But Osmand only will continue showing the new created favourite.... ! ?

Fix that helped for me:
I restarted not only Osmand but booted my Samsung.
After that - Osmand will now accept the data folder setting.
Osmand now properly downloads new maps to that folder and also shows them properly in the map selection.
It also now shows my old maps in the local maps section.
Only - some of them it yet doesn't show in downloaded maps section and doesn't want to open (e.g. an Italy map).

I have noticed the problem with the Routing for the Roundabout with the ""Avoid Motorway"" option enabled.

Without that option Routing is correctly counting the exits so you can follow your directions:

http://osm.org/go/0EQGXPdgV-  if follow direction from A1309 to A10.

With the Avoid Motorway option enabled Routing excludes the motorways from calculation which is good but it is excluding the exits too!!!!
And actually if it says take 1'st exit and you dont follow the signs you will end up in motorway !!!!

Also if ""Avoid Motorway"" is enabled it will be nice to have the icon shows that you should not take that exit and take the correct one.

For me it would make sense if the algorithm would choose to direct me from the secondary road to the tertiary road all the way around and not take the shortcut. But, have a look at the two new screen shots. I did choose v1.9 routing and fastest in the settings. In picture 1 Osmand tells me to use the red trunk road which is the best option, I think. In the second picture I moved the destination a bit further on, into the living area but still I placed it next the yellow tertiary road. The result is very different in a way that does not make sense for me. I think that I should get the 'same' result no matter where I place the destination inside this living area, because I will always need to pass this point http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=53.05034&mlon=8.84878#map=18/53.05034/8.84878.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Go to Settings, Navigation, Car. Under 'Show alarms', enable the option 'speed cameras'
2. Create speedcam obf-file. I created mine from http://flitspaal.nl/files/tomtom.zip . Used GPSBabel to convert .ov2 to .osm using the following configuration: tagnd=highway:speed_camera . Then used OsmAndMapCreator to convert .osm to .obf.
3. Enable speedcam obf-file in Osmand.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expect some kind of audible (using English TTS) or visible warning when approaching a speedcam. Obf-file is and loads OK since I can see the cameras listed when looking for POI's.
Nothing happens instead.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Osmand+ Market version 0.8.2 on Gingerbread

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Feature request: let users create a custom POI filter which finds all synagogues,"[Label(name=""Investigating"")]","I am using OsmAnd~ 2.0.0#10871M.  This is a OsmAnd-nightly.apk build which I downloaded today from your [/latest-night-build](http://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/) directory.

Wherever I go, I would like to be able to quickly find all synagogues near me, but so far I have been unable to do so using OsmAnd.
### Steps to reproduce
-  I pressed ""Menu"".
-  I tapped ""Search for POI"".
-  I tapped the three vertical dots next to the search field.
-  I tapped ""Custom filter"".
-  I tried to create a custom filter which will find synagogues and exclude churches, but could not find a way to create such a thing.
### The problem

I tried to create a custom filter which will find synagogues and exclude churches, but could not find a way to create such a thing.  As far as I can tell, neither OsmAnd~ 1.x nor OsmAnd~ 2 can do such a thing.

Finding _all_ places of worship wouldn't be as helpful.  I am Jewish, so I don't want to visit a church; and there are a _lot_ of churches in my city.
### My feature request

Ideally, it would be wonderful if you could please offer a way for me to find all POIs which are tagged with both `religion=jewish` and `amenity=place_of_worship` at the same time.

If this would be a hassle, it still would be good if you could offer a way for me to find all POIs which are tagged with `religion=jewish`, no matter whether they are synagogues or shops.  This indeed might also find Jewish religious supply shops (`shop=religion`), which I wasn't looking for, but that is okay.
### Important side notes
1. https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/5d8f82df569ab7aa5e5afe21a5ab3006848a05cb/OsmAnd/res/values/phrases.xml#L507 does mention Jewish places of worship.  But I don't think that line of that file actually does anything:  I doubt that it's connected with any of OsmAnd's actual Java code.
2. When I tap ""Custom filter"" then ""Tourism"", I do see an option labeled ""Place of worship"".  But I don't see any option labeled ""Place of worship: Jewish"".
3. And anyway, even though I live in a big city, choosing ""Place of worship"" doesn't find even one single place of worship within 500 km of me.  Not a synagogue, not a church, not anything.  Strange.
### Postscript

Thank you very much for writing and maintaining OsmAnd.  It's a really useful tool &mdash; and the fact that it's open source makes it even better.

Other crossings with a ""crossing=traffic_light"" are displayed with colored(red/green) traffic light.

For me the symbols of this 2 different crossings look almost to identical.
I think it is better to make a other symbol for uncontrolled crossings.
For example a traffic light(gray) with a / over the symbol to make it more understandable.

example 1:

on this roundabout are 3 crossings.
the one in the south have the tag crossing=uncontrolled.

For my personal needs, those should be 1 or 2 clicks away to enable, since either I have to press them while driving or I have to tell the person next to me to press them, and maybe he/she does not know OsmAnd controls.

But OsmAnd has so many features that event the smartest design ends up hiding some of them or confusing the user to find them, and I suppose not all users use OsmAnd like me, so my proposal is: Add a button with ""Custom shortcuts"" to the map view, and let the user choose which shortcuts he wants. Or display those shortcuts as buttons directly on the map, to aviod 1 extra click.

One remaining question is: which branch should my commits be based on?  This pull request is based on master, but these commits should easily apply to r1.9 as well.  Should I submit two pull requests?

_Updated to add a better description:_

The functionality of the current ""Share location"" menu is included, but it is just implemented using standard Android UX patterns (e.g. the _Share_/`ACTION_SEND` menu).
- to send an email, click ""Share location"", then choose your email app
- to send an SMS, click ""Share location"", then choose your SMS app
- to send another kind of message, click ""Share location"", then choose your messaging app (ChatSecure, Whatsapp, Hangouts, etc. etc.)
- to make a QR Code, click ""Share location"", then choose ""BarCode Scanner""
- to copy to clipboard, click ""Share location"", then choose ""Copy to clipboard""
- to view current location in a different app (aka ""geo:"" menu item), click ""View in other app""

If you want to try these for yourself, I've made a test build.  This is for testing only, it is not a trusted build, only use it on test devices.
https://guardianproject.info/builds/OsmAnd/OsmAnd-debug.apk

_update:_

One thing to note: I did not change net.osmand.plus.activities.actions.ShareDialog.java. It is almost exactly the same of ShareLocation, which this replaces, but I couldn't figure out where in the UI it is used, so I had no way to test it. So I left it as is.

I did a solution for this problem. Idea is to also know end point for roundabouts. So we can avoid changing to next direction until roundabout end is reached and visual direction remains visible. 
Distance has a behaviour that could be surprising for users, but is what I can do without changing a lot of code. Firstly drops as we arrive to start of roundabout (like previously) and when entering roundabout grow up to roundabout distance and goes to 0 when we arrive to marked exit.

There are 2 commits. one with the solution and another with minor simplifications i found.
I trush you will found this interesting.

The problem is that if a right turn is being taken, but `turn:lanes` doesn't have a lane where the right turn is indicated, then none of the lanes will be highlighted.

I propose a new favourites concept. It offers new features like multiple categories per favourite, custom icons and custom colours for the standard star-icon.
The additions include:
- A category manager to add, change and delete categories.
- When adding a favourite to the map: a categories list with check boxes to select one or more categories.
- In the map layers menu: a similar categories list with check boxes to choose the categories to be displayed.
- An icon manager (could be invoked from within the category manager) to choose the forecolour and backcolour of the standard icon and a file selector to choose a custom icon file for the category.

I include a simple database example to illustrate my idea of how to maintain these data.
I'd love to implement it myself, but I'm not enough experienced in Java to do it, so very sorry.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Fixed bug when user changes routing parameter and racalculation of route doesn't occur.,[],"Another small bug is this, I am not quite sure how to 100% reproduce it:

Calculate a route , then (while still on the route planning screen) press the transport mode button and change a route parameter (like change the ""avoid motorways"" flag, or the ""shortest way"" flag). It appears that in some cases the route gets re-calculated instantaneously, but with latest build I find many occurrences where this route-recalculation is not automatically triggered, i.e. you have to manually stop routing (X-button) and then re-start it to see the new route for the new parameter. I think automatic route-recalculation after a parameter change used to work ok, and was broken in the last 2 weeks.

It takes several tries to reproduce, the bug does not always seem to occur (Maybe not for all parameters).

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Show max speed limit at all roads,[],"Currently OsmAnd does not show the speed limit (in the widget on the right) if there is no maxspeed tagged on a road. 

I hope it does use the default maxspeeds from http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Maxspeed#Default_speed_limits on untagged roads. However it does not display those limits (to aid the driver to slow down). It could indicate the maxspeed is implied (guessed) in some way (e.g. adding a question mark) to distinguish this case from a road where maxspeed is explicitly tagged.

If OsmAnd can't determine if the road is inside a 'place' (a residential area marked with the proper signs) as it looks complicated (see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Talk:OSM_tags_for_routing/Maxspeed) I propose to at least assume residential/service/living_street is always inside a place. Higher level roads (tertiary up to motorway) probably have their maxspeeds defined explicitly so there is not much of a problem.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,wrong display of lanes,[],"Hi, I experience wrong number of lanes shown at this road: way 249191919 (https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/249191919).
There are these relevant tags:
lanes:psv=1
lanes=3
psv:lanes=yes|yes|designated
vehicle:lanes=yes|yes|no
oneway=yes

When I have routing enabled to go straight along this secondary road, OsmAnd 1.7.5 shows 4 lanes, and marks the leftmost 3 to follow (yellow and green) while the rightmost is grey (that looks fine, as it is reserved only for psv).
I know that the lanes are shown for the next intersection, but there is not place along this road where there are 4 lanes (continuing northwards onto the bridge).

The correct display would be to show 3 lanes and always mark only leftmost 2 to follow, because the rightmost one is reserved for psv. Only at some places it may be possible to use the 3rd lane for branching right (if tagged that way).

The theory is that OsmAnd adds the 1 lanes:psv-lane to the 3 lanes, while per the wiki the 'lanes' is for all motorized traffic so it includes the psv lane. It would be great if this would be fixed to allow better navigation in cities.
Thanks.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,fix osmo for russian language,[],
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Proposal: Simplification of Favourites,[],"- Favourites are currently identified by the tuple(name,category,lat,lon), this means that a point which is added twice in a different category will represent two different favourites, but with the same location on the map, thus when selecting this point on the map, two 'favourites' are shown.
- When loading a gpxfile (the gpxfile layer) point's within this gpx are also represented as favourites, they are however not really favourites. When you deselect the gpxfile the favourite is not a favourite anymore. However, When clicking the 'favourite' (when the gpxfile is shown) on the map, you can add it as a favourite (and then it becomes a real favourite). I found this quite confusing.

Proposal:
- a favourite should be identified by a pair(lat,lon). Category and name are just attributes of the favourite
- the favourites implementation (FavouritesDBHelper) should be refactored to only handle favourites (and not the 'fake track favourites')
- when showing a gpxfile, the 'points' could be represented as 'track favourites', visually different from true 'favourites' . The user could have the option to add 'track favourites' as favourite points (via e.g. a selection window). The proposed category could then be e.g. the name of the gpx file. The gpx file could be represented by 'track favourites' ; 'track' and 'route' (compare to the gpx editor proposal).
- favourites should be serialized/deserialized as a true gpx file (via e.g. standard gpx extensions). In this way the favourites are just another kind of 'GPX track' (one with no 'track'&'routes', just points), this would probably simplify the design of other components (e.g. favourites layer, gpxfile layer, distance measurement plugin, gpx editor,...).
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Proposal : keep gps on,[],"Currently for an end user to keep navigating when the screen is off (which is the default for a lot of users), following steps need to be taken:
- enable plugin 'registration services & sleep mode'
  [the description is confusing&misleading as no setting within the options of this plugin refers to 'sleep mode' or 'keep gps on when screen off']
- next step is to open the map screen, open the 'map settings' and enable the plugin which is now called 'registration services' (still no reference to 'keep gps on when screen off')
- next step is to click on the satellite dish and click on 'sleepmode' (sleep mode seems a technical term, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me)

This is way too complicated and not intuitively, as a new user this is very difficult to find/understand

Furthermore:
- enable tracking gives the same icon on the screen (no visual difference with 'sleepmode')
- when disabling tracking, the sleepmode is disabled as well (which is certainly not always the intention)
- each time you enable 'sleep mode' you need to re-enter the interval
- each time you open the app, you need to repeat the steps to tap the dish and then giving an interval
- when the user switches from navigation profile, the registration services disappear again and you have to repeat the same steps (e.g. most users will start from the default profile and then maybe switch to another profile). This adds even more to the confusion...

Proposal:
- keeping the gps on when the app is not visible or when the screen is turned off, should be a general setting, enabled by default
- the setting could be called more intuitively like 'keep gps on'
- there is no need to indicate with a notification icon that the gps is still on
- in the setting (a general setting), clearly indicate to the user that this has an influence on your battery life.
- The setting should have : on/off and an interval (although I'm not sure an interval is really needed, could be continuous)
- enable/disable tracking should not have an influence on this (when 'keep gps on' is enabled, the gps will be kept on, even after stopping with tracking)

At the moment, when we try to add a waypoint to the current GPX track, we have to select the text zone to have access to the keyboard.

Is it possible to automatically switch to keyboard when adding waypoints to the current GPX track ?

When doing some contribution to OpenStreetMap, I may add hundreds of step per track and loosing each time a few seconds for nothing. It's no big deal when walking, but more anoying when crossing a village by car with many little things to add.

I hope this tiny upgrade can be done.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Attempt to display lanes that go in two directions,[],"### Background

In the US (at least), some lanes on interstates may give you the option to go straight (continue on the interstate) or take the exit. Currently, this isn't represented in Osmand; the exit lane is displayed as a separate lane. This patch starts on fixing this.
### Changes

The patch uses 3 bits in the lane value to describe the characteristics of the lane. Bits 0-2 were previously documented in the comments (although I'm not sure if bits 1 and 2 are being used anywhere). Bits 3 and 4 describe whether you can only go straight or if there is a right branch or left branch (note that currently lanes that have a right branch _and_ a left branch aren't represented as one lane). Bit 5 specifies whether the branch should be taken or if you should go straight (used in rendering).

These bits are used in the rendering of the lanes. On lanes that have a right/left branch, the KR/KL arrow is used to display the branch from that lane. The KL arrow lines up nicely with the straight arrow, making it appear to come from the same root. However, the KR arrow needs a bit more shifting/tinkering.
### Bugs/Restrictions

One bug mentioned above is that the KR arrow doesn't align with the straight arrow. Another bug is that some roads that have a fork, but don't have lane data, may no longer show the lane window. One restriction is that this is _only_ for the cases where the right-most lane can go straight or go right and/or the left-most lane can go straight or go left. For all other cases, the old behavior _should_ be used. The eventual behavior is that this is extended for any number of lanes.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Launch experience,[],"Currently when starting OsmAnd, what you see is not a map, but rather a menu:
- Map
- Search
- Favorites
- Settings

Additionally they all seem to have equal importance because they are all of the same size and layout.

Instead, the first thing you should see when starting OsmAnd is **the map**. The map is the most important part of the app. That’s where I want to look where to go, where I want to search things, where I have my favorites.

The search bar should be integrated in the map. Like at the top, how many widely-used maps apps do. Or apps which offer a search, that is.

The favorites are displayed directly on the map. They should also be shown as suggestions in the search if the search term is relevant. And in a menu.

The settings should largely be unnecessary to edit because they use good defaults. An option to download region data could appear (non-intrusively) when you browse over said area. Settings will always be available through a menu in the main map view.
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Better search experience,[],"Search is a central part of any maps app. In OsmAnd »Search« is shown prominently in the menu, but it actually is more of a »Browse« function rather than simple search. I really like OsmAnd but the way search currently works really bugs me. So let’s improve it! :)

There currently are six (!) different ways to search/browse:
- Points of interest (default)
- Address search
- Coordinates
- Favorites
- Search history
- Transportation

If you’re looking for a restaurant for example, POI → Search by name is fastest (if you find it among the options).

If you want to look up an address, it gets cumbersome:
1. choose a region
2. choose a city
3. choose a street
4. choose a number

Which is kind of backwards from how people normally approach it. First you search for street+number, and if there are multiple results you either just choose one, or you add the city.

Then it comes to actually _seeing_ the result. In the address search, it takes some time to find out what you actually are supposed to do: Press one of the icons in the bottom bar (not knowing what they are for):
- routing/directions
- add as waypoint
- show on map (the thing I want!)
- add as favorite
- the arrow → gives me »online search«

Interesting, online search is actually the thing I wanted when I pressed »search« in the first place. Or rather: One input field where I can put in what I want to search.

All the other things like history, favorites etc could be suggestions in the results. But not separate categories which make me confused about what I need to select to simply get results.

Then there’s another thing which bars me from simply seeing what I wanted to search: I get a popover asking me if I want
- Directions
- add as waypoint
- Show on map
- add to Favorites

Where instead it could simply just show it on the map automatically and I could then decide what I want to do with it.

If that is a direction you are generally willing to go into, I would be happy to provide mockups, design consultation, and the like. :)

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,"Patch for issue1384 ""wrong left turn info""",[],"Discard points with same coordinates.

Translating coordinates from OSM to OBF can colapse near points to same
coordinates. When that happens, new connections between ways appears
and zero length segments becomes a source of trouble for algoritms.

Explanation
Transformation from lattitude-longitude coordinates to tile coordinates has a precision loss.
Firstly it does Merkator projection and then adjusts origin and range from 0 to 2^31 (get31TileNumberX, get31TileNumberY on MapUtils.java). Then applies a 4 bits right shift with precision loss and finally writes, to obf, deltas from one point to next (writeRouteData on BinaryMapIndexWriter.java). This precision loss can transform 2 different OSM points with different coordinates to 2 different obf points with same coordinates.
On issue 1384 this occurs on points 3 and 4 of road with id 76419769. On OSM next segment was only connected to point 4 but now both 3 and 4 are connected to start of next segment. When routing algorithm selects the segment from 3 to 4, its bearing is 0 degrees because atan2(0,0)=0 (incorrectely, it must be undefined). Then addTurnInfo adds a left turn because bearing of surrounding segments is around 70.
Additionally when route connects to point 3 and skip point 4, segment from 3 to 4 is evaluated to know if keep right info must be added. Fortunatelly atan2 bug avoids unnecessary keep right turn info now.

The way I did it, the new entry ""BRouter (offline)"" always appears in the selection list if you choose a navigation service. If chosen, but BRouter is not installed on the device, you get the corresonding error message at the time of route calculation.

Maybe it's possible to only offer the service in the selection list if BRouter is installed (that is, if Osmand cound bind to it's service), but I didn't succeed, the ""RouteService"" enum seemed to static for me to do that?

Thanks for taking the patch to the main branch 
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,GPX-tracks: Better compatibility with JOSM ,[],"Hi,

the gpx tracks from Osmand are currently not perfectly compatible to JOSM. 
When you record an audio message or take a photo or video through Osmand, the media files are not linked in the way that JOSM can easily work with.

Osmand does this:

```
<wpt lat=""(latitude)"" lon=""(longitude)"">
    <name>(filename)</name>
    <time>(time)</time>
</wpt>
```

The filename is built from a geo-shortlink and a counter.
What JOSM can work with at the moment is this:

```
<wpt lat=""(latitude)"" lon=""(longitude)"">
    <time>(time)</time>
    <name><![CDATA[Sprachaufnahme]]></name>
    <link href=""(filename)"">
        <text>(filename)</text>
    </link>
 </wpt>
```

I do not know if the name and text parts are necessary, but I'd guess the most important part is the link. When there is a link, JOSM shows a clickable link to the file when you load a gpx. If it's an image, it can be viewed in JOSM. 3gp would be opened in the external standard program. 

As it is now, I need to load the images manually and associate them with the track using their time stamps. 3gp can not be associated at all, so JOSM just shows the names of the files at their waypoints.

Of course, this is as much an JOSM issue, but maybe it can be fixed at the Osmand end.

Thank you and keep up the good work!

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,strange routing behaviour,[],"Routing along the motorway A81 Osmand seems to prefer motorway_link over motorway and uses the link-route along the motorway, although it is longer than the motorway itself (at least in the osm database).
OSM data defines maxspeed to be 120 in both cases, both variants are connected.

The variant using motorway has a length of 855,7m,
the other variant with motorway_link is of length 864m

OSM note: http://www.openstreetmap.org/?note=58990#map=16/49.1609/9.3012&layers=N

Why is this the case? where does it come from?
And independent from that, shouldn't the *-link ways be counted as slightly slower than the main highways (same class but no link)?
"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Issue1384,[],"Hi,

Looking for a solution to issue 1384 I found that origin of incorrect directions becomes from using 2 versions of the same map route segment (not zigzag OSM points as you suggested). One side original map segment and other side  new segment added as start, end or intermediate points on route. New segment has a new point added (then some points have a different index here than in original). This mix produce bizarre results on routing algorithm. I saw that when some times routes don't start or end at projection inserted points. This information propagates to directions producing incorrect ones.
The key is to exclude road segment based only on RouteDataObject.id, then RouteContext.loadRouteSegment (and other similar methods) can avoid to use old segment copy.
Problem remains if 2 or more of that new projection points are on same segment of map because no exclusion implemented over segments in RouteCntext.tileRoutes. A future patch.
I tested scenarios from issues 1384 and 1665. Seem solved. I tested old and precise routing algoritms but not native library.

I expect you can review this patch and apply it. Whatever you need let me know.

The original implementation was operationally tested as a GPS and planning tool for 2 months during a motorhome holiday in several European countries and the features were extremely valuable, particularly the display zoom and planning-track save/reload.
There is a small change required in the OsmAnd core that is subject to another pull request.

"
osmandapp/Osmand,closed,bicycle routing: Don't prefer cycleways too much over tracks/path/footways,[],"Previously we would make huge detours to prefer cycleways. E.g. versus a
footway with bicycle=yes we would take more than 3 time as long ways
(16/8)*(1.5/0.9) > 3 to use a cycleway. We would also take long detours
(more than twice as long ways) to prefer a track/path over a footway with
bicycle=yes. Often footway/bicycle=yes are synonyms for highway=path,
and the latter is not faster or better at all. This led to weird bicycle
routing where I was taking long detours to stay on a ""path"" rather than
a ""footway"".

Take up Victors suggestion of bumbing the speed of a footway
from 8 to 12, which is still realistic and tone down the priority of 1.5
for cycleways/track/path to 1.3 which was too high.
This is what this patch does. Now we have:

Highway=   Speed=   Priority=  Detours-vs-footway=
footway    12       1          --
track/path 12       1.3        30%
cycleway   16       1.3        73%

I believe this still prefers tracks/path and cycleway enough and the
weird routing went away. (the data has changed now or I would give
the example location. But I tested a few bike routes involving various
ways and the suggestions were sensible.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Fix last Junit test + Bodensee issue,[],"The last Junit test is trivally fixed.

For the bodensee issue, I created a method that should calculate the intersection of two Rings. So if you do

bodenseeMP.closeWithOtherRing(boundaryOfSwitserlandRing), it should return a complete Ring with the part of the Bodensee in Switserland.

Because this has to happen during indexing, and I don't think I can create extra nodes, there is a small overshoot. The lake will go one node over the boundary, to return and follow it. When installing the maps of the other side of the boundary, those overshoots should be invisible because of overlap.

Note, only the calculation method has been made, nothing has changed in the indexing method. It's still a matter of finding the right boundary to intersect with there.

It's also untested (this would be my next job), so it certainly can contain off-by-one errors, or other things.

 5: Change favorite Gpx import to match point 4 (i.e. don't move to Others on missing '_')

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,Initial Wikimapia vector API support.,[],"It just draws vector data along with labels to the bitmap tile,
that implementation cuts long texts at the tile border.
Also the rendering is very slow, and overcrowded with text labels
on the lower zoom levels.

This is only initial support, I'm going to improve it (at least move the labels to the separate layer, or maybe merge with the POI layer). So I'm not insisting on merging yet :)

The correct implementation should use sqlite database,
also the Wikimapia API provides the way to only download object indexes
for the given tile, then download each separate object by index,
that will save traffic and disk space usage, because one object
is usually present on the different tiles, and on the different zoom levels.

Wikimapia has some interesting properties compared to the other maps, it's 2x more detailed compared to the OpenStreetMap in my city, and it has more accurate data compared to the Google Maps, although it does not mark all the buildings on the usual street.

This method of context sensitive help could be extended for wider use, but some framework would be required. Currently the help info is in English only.

Location points (generated in the usual way - long touch map location) can be added, removed or dragged.
Two different info text boxes can be displayed: distance only, or lat/long + distance. Short tap on info text opens a context sensitive menu. Long touch text hides it in the usual way.

Measurement start from the first point and the distance accumulates as new points are added.

Tapping on any point opens a context sensitive menu for editing and setting options.

my idea is this:
change RouteSegment and add projection.x and projection.y (already calculated):
then if segmentStart = -1 -> routesegment is Projection-segmentEnd (that should be the first (or second) route segment)
if segmentEnd = -1 -> routesegment is segmentStart-Projection (that should be the last route segment)

now offline route calculation doesn't use projection and is really bad for small distances.

Since these settings cannot be applied after show() has been invoked, created factory method. This also improves the general design by increasing the separation of concerns.

Further improvements to consider that would build upon this change:
- The factory method could be used in more places.
- Unzipping should send progress notifications.
- Indexing should send progress notifications.

osmandapp/Osmand,closed,download progress bar,[],"cf. http://code.google.com/p/osmand/issues/detail?id=619:

I am not happy with the (infrequently updated) textual percentage in the download progress viewer and would like to suggest a standard progress bar instead.

I have implemented this suggestion, using Android's standard ProgressDialog with a bar. On Android 2.x, it will show the number of bytes actually downloaded; for 3.0, the code as written switches these numbers off.

We could also make the unzipping step report its progress, obviously, but that has not been done yet. For unzipping, the style is changed to indeterminate. Switching to spinner mode seems not to be possible after show() and would require two dialogs and calling hide() on one and show() on the other.
