arifhn/nstools,closed,Polish translation,[],"Hi,

I decided to contribute by adding a translation into Polish. There are 3 commits to the file due to an encoding mistake - fixed now (sorry, I'm a newbie to GitHub:).

Please consider adding it to your repo.

Thanks.

arifhn/nstools,closed,Allowing NSTools to be built into custom ROMS,[],"This commit allows one to pull NSTools into a custom ROM project through the android manifest and build it as an included package.

Also fixed some localization build errors.

If you pull this, you will allow ROM developers to link their project's manifest directly to your github repo allowing NSTools to build the most current version available on your github without having to manually merge the update into the ROM developer's code base.

Tested on Crossbones ROM

arifhn/nstools,closed,Use Theme.Holo when running on ICS,[],"I modified the manifest so it targets SDK14 while running in Gingerbread too, so it uses the new theme when running on ICS. I also made the app close when MainActivity is hidden because otherwise the values wouldn't change.

I did some testing on Ice Cream Sandwich and it looks like everything is working fine.
Thanks a lot for creating this app!
