cernekee/ics-openconnect,open,How to configure a domain name for a split tunnel?,[],"In split tunnel model, I can set a route like 192.168.1.0/24, but wen I use domain name like \*.google.com/\*, it show me that skipping invalid route, why?

cernekee/ics-openconnect,open,Add New Connection button disappeared on Android TV,[],"Device name: Xiaomi TV 4C ( https://www.mi.com/mitv4c/55/ )

Installed APK via USB Flash drive, and APK file downloaded from https://apkpure.com/openconnect/app.openconnect .

First time launch can't find the ""+"" button. just like this:

![](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/4b91f9d5gy1furi213e0rj219c0u0hbz.jpg)

On my phone, it supposed to be at the top-right edge of interface.

cernekee/ics-openconnect,closed,libopenconnect.so has text relocations,[],"There is a closed issue related to this error:
https://github.com/cernekee/ics-openconnect/issues/7
But it was closed without any actually good solution. Lowering the target SDK version doesn't seem to be a good approach.

To clarify: it still fails with a latest code version, despite there is a commit:
https://github.com/cernekee/openconnect/commit/b31ca89f298644c271e49addeea6bbedc34b079c
that seems to be related, and potentially should fix the issue (however, it seems like it didn't)

Going to try to use latest versions of gmp and gnutls libs, but maybe somebody has a solution already?"
cernekee/ics-openconnect,open,Multi-protocol support,[],"Very preliminary take on #28â€¦ but it's already working for me with both GlobalProtect and Juniper :grinning:

TODO:
* Populate the `vpn_protocol` preference list dynamically using `mOC.getSupportedProtocols()`
* Enable/disable other preferences based on `VPNProto.flags`
* **(done)** ~~Update docs to reflect multi-protocol support.~~
* **(done)** ~~The `X-CSTP-Idle-Timeout` field should be replaced with a protocol-agnostic field (which doesn't yet exist in the openconnect base)~~
* **(done)** ~~Juniper servers will throw extra authentication applets/trojans at you if `Java` appears in your `User-Agent` string :man_facepalming: â€¦ it'd be good to be able to set the `User-Agent` string.~~

cernekee/ics-openconnect,open,Support non-AnyConnect protocols via libopenconnect API,[],"As of dlenski/openconnect@40802e459873e55eefbe64f05b9475821f761b8e (not yet in an official openconnect release) there is a new API to get the list of supported protocols, along with their descriptions and supporting features.

```c
int openconnect_get_supported_protocols(struct oc_vpn_proto **protos);
void openconnect_free_supported_protocols(struct oc_vpn_proto *protos);
int openconnect_set_protocol(struct openconnect_info *vpninfo, const char *protocol);
```

The next OpenConnect release should include this API along with (optimistically :grinning:) support for GlobalProtect VPNs (`gp`) in addition to AnyConnect and Juniper (`nc`).

In the NetworkManagerOpenconnect frontend, it was quite straightforward (https://git.gnome.org/browse/network-manager-openconnect/commit/?id=1ed6de801a398887277fbb9c35d9f5f5d6c4d5c3) to add multiprotocol support using this API, and it's underway on the Windows openconnect-gui as well (openconnect/openconnect-gui#158).

Are you interested in adding multiprotocol support the Android front-end as well?

From my perusal of your code, it appears that it's clean and only interfaces with `libopenconnect` using the public API :+1: :+1:. One minor exception that I see is that [you use the AnyConnect-specific `X-CSTP-Idle-Timeout` option](https://github.com/cernekee/ics-openconnect/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/openconnect/core/OpenVpnService.java#L198) as a hint for how often the keepalive function should run."
cernekee/ics-openconnect,open,Per-app VPN support,[],"Hello,

Does your code/library support per-app VPN? Would it be technically possible to merge this code with my own student project to try to establish a per-app VPN connection, ideally upon starting of an app (e.g. in onCreate), while leaving the other app's communication on the phone intact?

Thanks in advance.

Niki"
cernekee/ics-openconnect,open,Marked as vulnerable in F-Droid,[],"I just updated F-Droid to version 1.0 and it altered me that a number of my installed packages, including OpenConnect, were vulnerable.

More precisely, it has the KnownVul and DisabledAlgorithm tags, both described [here](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeature:KnownVuln). From what I understand, it is mostly a matter or re-packaging rather than re-coding anything..."

Any idea about what could be wrong? Perhaps the wrong Host: header is being passed? It should be ""Host: vpn.xxxxx.com:4443"", right?

Thanks in advance for any insight.
