anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Is Lightning Browser still alive?,[],"The developer hasn't written anything here for a long time and the last update was done a long time ago. I'd be happy to get a statement from anthonycr if there's more development to come or if I'd better look for another browser.
That would be a pity, because Lightning has been my favourite browser for a long time. But if nothing happens here anymore, I'll have to change."

I use DuckDuckGo as a search engine, and have a bookmark with all my search engine settings as the homepage.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,closed,Creating TabInitializer visitor to standardize initial URL loading,[],"# Summary
The logic dictating the initial URL loaded by a `LightningView` originally was a combination of external logic and internal logic that followed the following pattern:
- `null` - home page preference was loaded.
- `""url""` - url was loaded.
- `""""` - nothing was loaded, it was up to external consumers to load something later.

This was pretty flexible, but it was not readable at all as there was no indication to a consumer that passing `null` would result in the homepage being loaded, but passing an empty string would result in nothing being loaded at start. Therefore, this system introduced in this PR was created where a visitor is now injected into the `LightningView` in place of the `url: String`.

This visitor is called a `TabInitializer` and there are several variants right now.
- `UrlInitializer`: loads a url after load.
- `HomePageInitializer`: loads the user's home page preference.
- `StartPageInitializer`: loads the start page.
- `BookmarkPageInitializer`: loads the bookmark page.
- `AsyncUrlInitializer`: loads the url emitted by an `rx.Single`.
- `ResultMessageInitializer`: sets the `WebView` as the target of a `Message`.
- `BundleInitializer`: restores the `WebView` from a `Bundle`.
- `NoOpInitializer`: doesn't do anything to the `WebView`.

This allows more clarity in the various ways that `LightningViews` were initialized."

The interesting part is the ""bad IPC message, reason 127"".
I investigated the chromium code and found out that the bad massage 127 is an
WSI_INVALID_HEADER_VALUE 

see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/content/browser/bad_message.h

and that the WSI_INVALID_HEADER_VALUE is an empty user_agent string:

std::string additional_headers;
   if (!user_agent_override.empty()) {
   if (!net::HttpUtil::IsValidHeaderValue(user_agent_override)) {
   bad_message::ReceivedBadMessage(
   delegate_->GetClientProcessId(),
   bad_message::WSI_INVALID_HEADER_VALUE);
   return;

see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/62.0.3178.1/content/browser/websockets/websocket_impl.cc

So your code looks like that:
public static void enableUserAgentOverwrite() {
        System.setProperty(""http.agent"", """");

The settings fragments are old legacy code and difficult to read and follow.

# Implementation summary
- Converted `AdvancedSettingsFragment` to Kotlin.

- Renamed one of the `clickablePreference` functions, which allowed callers to modify the summary, to `clickableDynamicPreference`.

This PR provides support for WebRTC, by adding the necessary UI to request permissions from the user. The resources requested by the site are mapped to the needed permissions and requested if necessary. Each time a site requests to use a resource, a request dialog will show.

As this is can cause potential problems, and support for WebRTC has been a controversial topic in the past, I am opening this feature up for comments and suggestions before committing it directly.

Problems I see currently:
- Added three permissions which will be automatically granted to the browser on API < 21 (upside is that the permissions are not used except when expressly granted through request dialog).

While testing my app I discovered this rare issue with Lightning Browser: apparently some long URLs will cause the audio not to play.
The issue is not present in Chromium, and I'm 100% sure that the audio is not corrupt because it's streaming right out of ffmpeg.
Here's what the request URL from Chromium looks like:
```
/song/Michele's%20Patrician%20Taste%20Collection%2FBach%20Edition%2FVol%20I%20-%20Orchestral%20%26%20Chamber%2FCD01%20-%20Brandenburg%20Concertos%2F01%20Consort%20of%20London.%20Conductor%20%20Robert%20Haydon%20Clark%20-%20Brandenburg%20Concerto%201%20in%20F%20major%2C%20BWV%201046%20-%20Allegro.flac?format=opus&bitrate=96&ar=48000&ac=2&ss=0
```
And here's the one from Lightning, which is identical and produced the same output:
```
/song/Michele's%20Patrician%20Taste%20Collection%2FBach%20Edition%2FVol%20I%20-%20Orchestral%20%26%20Chamber%2FCD01%20-%20Brandenburg%20Concertos%2F01%20Consort%20of%20London.%20Conductor%20%20Robert%20Haydon%20Clark%20-%20Brandenburg%20Concerto%201%20in%20F%20major%2C%20BWV%201046%20-%20Allegro.flac?format=opus&bitrate=96&ar=48000&ac=2&ss=0
```
The 2 requests only had a different user-agent.
The server did not close the connection or report any issue, but Lightning closed the connection, did not play, and started reconnecting as if there was a connection problem.
Copying the URL in the address bar starts a download, and it works, so it's most likely an issue with Opus decoding.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,v4.3.3 sometimes hang ui while switching for manually opened new tab,[],"Hello, firstly thank you for developing this lite but powerful browser.
I'm not a native English speaker, so I may describe incorrectly.
I have used lightning browser for some time. For the 4.3.3 version, when I long press on a link on a certain webpage and then the dialogue shows up, it sometimes hangs the ui, in this time you can't either press the button  ""open it on new tab""(my system is in Chinese language) nor you cannot press other places of the browser UI to cancel the dialog, or even the Android status bar. I have to return to the home screen and choose to force stop the app in the settting panel. Because my phone performs not well, I don't know whether it's my outdated cpu's fault, the Android webview's performance shortage, or lightning's unreasonable design. I don't know how to programme neither.
My OS is android 4.1 based on qualcomm 400 series, 768M RAM. But I think if it is the problem of the app, it can happen on some high-performance phones, too.
I will appreciate it if you can have a look at this issue. And it don't occur often or on a special webpage.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,hello. I got something to improve your Data Access Object code.,[],"On Lightning-Browser/app/src/main/java/acr/browser/lightning/database/HistoryDatabase.java,
I find something to improve your DAO code.
When you make a queryString, it's use a PLUS operation.
that cause some problem.

First. it makes more use memory and degraded your browser DAO speed.

Second. it makes more weak your browser on sql injection.

so. I think how about change your code using ""SQLiteStatement""

example is
SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
SQLiteStatement stmt = db.compileStatement(""SELECT \* FROM Country WHERE code = ?"");
stmt.bindString(1, ""KOREA"");
stmt.execute();

changing code like this , I think you can improve your browser data access speed and security on sql injection.

thank you for reading.^^
"
anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Closing a tab sometimes hides the browser,[],"When a tab was opened through another application, pressing the ""Back"" button behaves properly and closes the tab, then returns you to the application that you came from.

However, if you close a tab that was opened from another application by opening the tabs drawer and clicking the ""x"", it closes the tab and then hides Lightning. Lightning should remain focussed if you close a tab this way.
"
anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Animations,[],"Hi.

So the animations to change between settings menus and closing tabs are nice and all, but it'd be great to have an option to disable them. I often end up with tons of tabs open researching something and when I'm done, I used to just spam tap one spot and they'd all go pretty quickly, but it feels like I have to wait forever to between closing tabs now.

Thanks.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Difficulty returning to Duckduckgo search page?,[],"I use Duckduckgo as my default search engine in Lightning. Since the latest update I've had to tap the back button two or three times to return to DDG search results from a webpage. It goes like this:
1. Search X on Duckduckgo
2. Click on a search result to go to domain.com
3. From domain.com, I want to return to search results; usually just one back tap away. Now it takes two or three taps, otherwise domain.com page just reloads.

I haven't checked this with other search sites like Google, so can't determine if it's a DDG or lightning issue, but it seems to coincide with the latest Lightning update?

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,any file not uploading and downloading takes place outside the app,[],"Hello dear friend.

Lightning browser doesn't upload any file.
And the downloading takes place outside the
 App with no advanced.

So dear it must have. -

1 . own downloading manager.
Just implement download manager library.
2 . should upload file.
3. Menu covered whole screen.
So menu should be horizontal in bottom of the app. Like another web browser. 
And if you can then apply data compression technology to fast loading the web page.

Thanks in advanced I you can.

I saw that an update for Lightning 4.3.3 was available on F-Droid so I tried to upgrade but apparently the package was signed with a different key so I had to uninstall the one I had, which in itself is a little bit annoying since that means losing all my bookmarks and so on. But the main issue is that I can't install the latest version. I grabbed some logs for you : http://pastebin.com/3m0PeJhv

Does this version fix the downloading issue for Marshmallow ? I really love your browser it's truly amazing but I have to juggle with two browsers whenever I need to download a file.

Thanks a lot for your good work, keep it up, and I hope you fix this issue too so that I can go back to using Lightning :).

Either because you can't really navigate their UIs and or the webpages (Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Lightning) or they can't download stuff (the one available Android TV browser or Opera's TV browser).

So my feature request would be a UI that is navigable with directional keys only. In tablet ui mode I can easily get to the back and forward keys and the menu button, but I can't select the address bar. Downloading works, but since there is no notification tray of any kind you just have to wait and guess when it's finished (that's the reason I am using ES File Explorer's download mode, which displays a pop up).

those things be cleared.

We've been developing ""panic button"" features in our apps for years, and now we are working to make a more flexible and open ecosystem of apps that can both trigger other apps, or respond to triggers. This setup allows for easy configuration of a single trigger action which can then trigger multiple apps.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Fillr integration?,[],"I'm interested in seeing what people think about http://www.fillr.com/ and whether I should consider integrating support into the browser, a couple users have requested it and their team has been pinging me for a couple weeks. [Here is a mildly technical document explaining its functionality](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54cb10c3e4b0a44a770927e8/t/5631a7d7e4b0a303bd23d3bb/1446094851280/Tech_Whitepaper.pdf)

Basically, it does form filling (which Lightning currently does not do). It does not fill passwords/usernames, only other form information (email, address, payment info, etc.). It was suggested by a couple users who would like to see it in the browser, but I personally don't see the big benefits... I'd much prefer to add some sort of password manager. I don't have any metrics on how many people visit commerce sites using the browser, so I can't really determine if it's something many users would benefit from.

I created an unscientific twitter poll yesterday to gauge interest and the result was in favor of fillr: 73%. However, the fillr account, which apparently follows me, saw the poll and @ tweeted to it, so I have no idea if they could have had people vote in favor of it or not and skewed it.

Then I created a google plus poll in the browser beta community interested in the response, and the response was exactly the opposite, against fillr: 78%. So now I have two unscientific polls saying the opposite thing. Not super helpful, as the G+ responses are more highly correlated with interest in Lightning though through the requirement to be part of the community, I am taking that result as more important.

I figured I would create an issue and see what those of you who contribute to the project have to say as your opinion is the most valuable.

My 2 cents is that I think the idea is cool, form filling is better than nothing - which is the way Lightning currently operates. The company claims to heavily encrypt the data locally and not send it to the server, and seems reputable. But, I'm concerned with a company that has no clear monetization strategy having so much access to important personal data. Their sdk works by injecting JS into a webpage as far as I can understand from the above document, which seems concerning from a security standpoint as we cannot directly audit their code as it is not open source. Also their sdk regularly updates the JS and mapping used to work rather than requiring a library update, so that seems like a potential security risk as JS is being downloaded and executed without control in lightning... of course websites everywhere do exactly that all the time so on the other hand is it really a problem.

Please comment with your thoughts even if it's just a simple yes or no. I really want to make good decisions for this app as I've gained the trust of many people and I don't want to violate that.

I will also add that this would be a monetization opportunity for the browser according to fillr (based on the app's MAU).

As a random aside, I'd personally much rather do search engine monetization than any other kind as I find that it's non-intrusive to the user and basically just as privacy safe as regular browsing (but unfortunately no one has reached out to me to do).

The problem is that, if I were to open LB _again_ (from the launcher), it would redirect me _again_ to my reddit client. This is because the tab didn't close, and it opened up on a quasi-redirection page. The result is that I can't use LB without clearing all my data (as far as I know).

Altough I'm authenticating successfully on the ""root"" page, when Lignthing download the file it fails.
Looking with Wireshark at what is happening it seems Lightning uses Android Download manager to get the file but doesn't provide http auth credentials to the Download Manager as you can see in hereby provided PNGs.

Also, Lightning seems to test file availability asking for one byte of the file. The byte you request is located at position 3728, what is happening if a requested file is smaller than this size ? Wouldn't be better to ask for first byte instead ?

Chrome and FIrefox work well in very same situation.

If this isn't an easy fix, maybe the bar with ""home, back etc"" could be made transparent, or off completely in landscape.

Thanks!

This issue relates to the Play Store version - the F-Droid version (4.0.10a) works for me. Normally it crashs immediatly, but sometimes, especially if I start lightning through the Play Store, it starts. Then it crashes when I try to visit another url.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,WebRTC API leaks IP Addresses via JavaScript,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","See https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/ and https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips for a demo. Even using Orbot, IP address is still accessible via this WebRTC API to JavaScript as it does not require any permission to read. Solution is currently unknown as there is no WebView flag to turn off WebRTC that I am aware of. A non-trivial solution would be to separately download and parse all JavaScript to detect the usage of the vulnerability and block any script from loading that utilizes the vulnerability, but this would be very very expensive and would probably be worse than just turning off JavaScript entirely.

It may be an issue with system's download manager, because none of the browsers that uses android download manager works.  However, most work if they have a non system depended download: naked browser is a good example.

I'm on a 720p device. Could you perhaps add a settings menu with some small tweak options to the beta? The speed dial could do with some basic settings to force the layout to behave as desired (ie. No sideways scroll, always X columns, recache favicons - often have sites display a globe logo on the speed dial but not in the bookmarks list).

All the best

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,For WebChromeClient.onShowFileChooser() in API 21,[],"As we know that in **API 21** Android use new method `WebChromeClient.onShowFileChooser()` to upload file(s) in `WebView`.

But in [Lightning-Browser's source code](https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser/blob/master/app/src/main/java/acr/browser/lightning/activity/BrowserActivity.java#L2182) I think the usage of this method is **wrong**. The source code shows that we pick some pictures from the file chooser, in fact the implement is copied from [chromium-webview-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-webview-samples).

I think the `WebChromeClient.onShowFileChooser()` should **not only** pick some pictures **but also** choose other files such as "".docx"" and so on.

To achieve above goal we can implement this method easily, just follow this code(used in `BrowserActivity.java`):

```
private ValueCallback<Uri[]> filePathCallback = null;

@Override
public void showFileChooser(ValueCallback<Uri[]> filePathCallback, WebChromeClient.FileChooserParams fileChooserParams) {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
        this.filePathCallback = filePathCallback;

        try {
            Intent intent = fileChooserParams.createIntent();
            startActivityForResult(intent, YOUR_REQUEST_CODE);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // TODO: when open file chooser failed
        }
    }
}

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
    if (requestCode == YOUR_REQUEST_CODE && Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
        filePathCallback.onReceiveValue(WebChromeClient.FileChooserParams.parseResult(resultCode, intent));
        filePathCallback = null;
    }
}
```

Hope can help you :)

It does require the I2P client library v0.7, which will be released in a week or so.

If desired, I can add a ""Manual"" option for users to manually enter the details of an HTTP proxy. I am not sure how you would want that presented in the settings menu.

I can also revert the import changes in `BrowserActivity` if desired, but I wouldn't do it until the PR is about to merge, because it is being auto-managed by Android Studio.

Currently when cookies are enabled in incognito mode, they are not deleted when closing the application, making this mode not that incognito... For example I use incognito mode to log into my Google account, then I close my browser ans I use incognito mode for something else : Google knows it because I'm still authentified on their side... I would vote for forcing incognito cookies deletion when closing the browser, but a checkbox would be okay too ;-)

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Expand Orbot/Tor mode,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","We are currently working on our EOL plans for Orweb, with our new focus on Orfox, a Firefox-based/Tor-Browser based browser (https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/orfox-private-browser/).

I already have started promoting Lightning more to users who want something more powerful than Orweb, but I have also been thinking that not everyone is going to want to use Orfox, since it is going to be very memory/storage intensive. We also need some sort of upgrade path for our 1M+ Orweb users that isn't jarring.

I have two ideas that I have been considering:

1) Work with you to create an Orweb-branded version of Lightning, that would have different default settings aimed to be more private, secure... this might include having javascript off by default, setting DDG as the default search engine, clear cache on exit, always use incognito, etc....

2) Add a more complete ""private mode"" or ""super/actual incognito"" feature in Lightning, that would activate when you detect Orbot... ""It looks like you have Orbot installed, do you want to enable the super-incognito mode?""

Any thoughts, preferences?

The idea of whitelist just following steps:
1. We need a `List<>` to save domains in whitelist.
2. In `WebViewCilent.shouldOverrideUrlLoading()`, we check if the param `url` is contained in `List<>`. If contained we disable AdBlock in this domain.

Hope can help you :)

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,closed,NetCipher is breaking the build [dev branch] - gradle changes,[],"libnetcipher is used by the browser, and it requires the support-v4 library to build properly. The owners of the repository have decided to add the support-v4 .jar file to the project in their gradle file instead of pulling in a version from maven. This conflicts with the appcompat-v7 library I'm using in gradle, because that relies on the latest support-v4, so it pulls in the latest .jar from maven and then there are two conflicting support-v4 .jars being included in the build.

Locally, the fix is to open the build.gradle file in libnetcipher and replace the lines:

```
// compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.3'
// compile 'com.madgag.spongycastle:core:1.51.0.0'
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
```

with

```
compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:22.1.1'
compile 'com.madgag.spongycastle:core:1.51.0.0'
compile files('libs/httpclientandroidlib-1.2.1.jar')
```

NOTE: The version of the support library must be the same version used to build the app (currently 22.1.1.

However, I don't know how to fix this at the repo level without forking the NetCipher libary and applying the fix myself using that as a reference. Also, this fix cant work with Travis CI because it pulls in the libnetcipher library from git and so changes to the libraries gradle file made locally won't apply.

Anyone have any ideas?

I love the browser, however I am right handed person (guess as most people) and I find it extremely difficult to use it as such - I hold the phone in my right hand. The most common action is to open new tab, switch tab, close tab. I hardly ever use bookmarks.

it would be so much better to have tabs available via right swipe and bookmarks via left swipe than how it is today. Also, it would be really nice if the list of tabs could stick on the bottom of the screen rather than top as that would make them much more accessible via the right hand thumb.

I completely appreciate that it may not work for everybody so would be awesome to add 2 new options:
1) Swap the tabs and bookmarks (this would put tabs to right and bookmarks right)
2) Align tabs to bottom (this would align the list of opened tabs to the bottom of the screen)

I am absolutely OK to keep the layout of the top bar (no need to swap things there if that's not easy).

I was looking at the code and this really should be fairly simple change.

What do you think? Doable?

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,open,Left menu icon in the address bar sometimes becomes stuck.,[],"It happens at random times. Clicking the text on the address bar unstucks it, because then the icon becomes an arrow pointing to the left. Switching between tabs does not unstuck it. Since the Material Design update, it happend to me 3 times. I am using the browser a lot, so the bug is rare.

Examples of the bug:

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,closed,The new version of Lightning crashes directly when I start it. The older version (with orbot) uses almost all RAM memory.,[],"Hello!

The new version of Lightning 3.2.0.1a crashes directly when I start it.

The older one 3.1.1a starts fine, but sometimes it crashes when using more than one tab. When I use it together with Orbot, after opening two or three websites, the smartphone's RAM memory is completely filled. This makes the phone very very slow. Killing Orbot or Lightning does not free up that memory again.

Here is the logcat of the crash of 3.2.0.1a.

Best regards, Philipp

- Two new switches are added: Block Images and Enable Javascripts. The reasoning behind this is somewhat explained in #147, but basically it comes down to enabling easy control of mobile data expenses. Some of users want a quick way to disable everything but the text when they're on mobile data plan.
- Location switch is moved to Privacy and Fullscreen switch is moved to Display activity. They aren't that important to be in main category, IMHO.
- _Restore lost tabs_ option could go into General activity, but I left it in Advanced, for now.
- Images display default preferences, except for Display category (_Full-screen Mode_ and _Text Reflow_ are off by default).

Looking forward to opinions.

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,closed,Initial work to support Tor (Orbot) and proxying,[],"He there. I am with the https://guardianproject.info and we like Lightning alot. This PR is for the most basic integration of support for proxying Lightning's webviews through Tor, but it does work. It could be expanded to be a general preference, and include support for other HTTP proxy servers if desired.

Otherwise, we would like to explore adding more privacy-by-default options into Lightning, perhaps make Incognito actually secure/privacy, support encrypted bookmarks, downloads, and more. If you are interested, we'll keep sending PR's, otherwise we can also fork. Up to you!

Regardless, keep up the great work on a nice app!

- Any other suggestion to achieve the above mentioned requirement?

anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,closed,Hebrew Update,[],
anthonycr/Lightning-Browser,closed,styling tipps and other stuff,[],"added some comments how you could improve some aspects.
Main aspects are:
- naming conventions
- extract every class to its own file (distinquish with packages between 'big subjects' not class files)
- also split up not-reused methods into their own methods, so that everyone can understand your code and probably use it too.
  -- do this for small tasks especially, you will also find some cases where you can reuse created methods.
- for e.g. preference -tags (or names, ids, however you call it) use constants. E.g. create a .java file called BrowserPreferences
  -- create public static final String variables with meaning full names (and following the naming conventions) for each constant.. 
  -----e.g. public static final String PREF_USER_AGENT = ""useragent"";
  ----- or.. public static final String PREF_SOMETHING_ELSE = ""somethingelse"";
  --- and access them via Classname.CONSTANT_NAME .. e.g. BrowserPreferences.PREF_USER_AGENT this is especially useful for avoiding errors when reusing them. (like typos) and you can easily change them afterwards.
  *don't use getters too much if you need objects more than once.
  -- e.g. instead use: MyObject obj = someObject.getMyObject(); 
  --                   obj.setSomething(""BLA!""); obj.setSomethingElse(true);

and much more stuff, but I hope these tipps might increase the style of your code a bit. :)
