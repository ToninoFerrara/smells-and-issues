xargsgrep/PortKnocker,open,incompatible API use in your code.,[],"Hi,
Our tool detect this app's apk file from f-droid.org(version: 1.0.11) and find several potential bugs. We already check them  but we cannot make 100% sure that they are definitely bugs. So we need your help.

We find component ""com.ianhanniballake.localstorage.LocalStorageProvider"" in AndroidManifest.xml is actually from an external library. This class extends from DocumentsProvider which is added into SDK since level 19. while your app's minSDKVersion is 10.  So this is very likely to cause your app crash.

please help to check. Thanks very much.

Any ideas? Do other have the same problem?

xargsgrep/PortKnocker,closed,Fix filehandling android 7,[],"I noticed on my new Android 7 smartphone, that file access was not working correctly. It seems ""file://"" URIs are not working well anymore in Android 7 due to access right changes. Instead ""content://"" shall be used, providing the correct rights. I have changed it in the file chooser and in the handling of URI of the port knocker class.
Additionally the intent-filter was not working with the e-mail client on the new phone, so intent-filter was adapted.
Rest of changes are updates due to Android Studio updates.

Rights management forbids file scheme sharing and instead we need to use content schemes. Filters adapted accordingly.

Additionally the application must request for external memory read/write rights, regardless of the manifest settings. Certain functionality (import, export, send, receive) is blocked as long as rights are not given."

xargsgrep/PortKnocker,closed,Send and receive config,[],"Hi,
my final contribution for Port Knocker: Sending and receiving config directly from the app. As such per ""Send hostlist"" directly e-mail, bluetooth, android beam or any other app that can handle ""application/octet-stream"" mime-types can be used to send the host-list. Port Knocker is as well filtering for files of that mime-type with extension ""*.json"", so can directly take the config from e-mail or other content providers.
Also fixed a few points shown up by Lint code analysis.
Hope you can push to play-store so I can use the official one from play.
Thanks!"
xargsgrep/PortKnocker,closed,"Added support for multiple widget sizes (1x1, 2x1, 3x1 and 4x1).",[],"Hi,
added multiple widget sizes from Port Knocker. I know the 1x1 can also be resized horizontally, but not many people know about that feature as not many widgets support it. (Also gave me a chance to play with it ;-)). At least I also added widget previews and that works like a charm on my LG.

Finally fixed a few lint warnings in AndroidManifest (android:allowBackup) and layout/widget.xml (android:singleLine obsolete).
