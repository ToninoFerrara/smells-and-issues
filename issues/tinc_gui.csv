I am able to ping the VPN gw at 10.4.0.1 but unable to ping any other peers on the vpn. Is there something else on Android 6.x I need to be aware of to be able to ping peers? 

Any help is appreciated. I know Tinc worked fine on Android 4.3 so I suspect there is something different about 6.x

Then I connect through LTE to peer which I want use as a default gateway, DNS stopped to work.
Seems like problem in providers DNS, which stands not in my LAN. Because if I connect through Wi-Fi with DNS in my phone network, all works fine.

For example, through LTE my phone IP can be like 10.99.143.25/30, 10.112.2.159/26 and so on. And DNS is 10.220.4.9, 10.221.4.9. So to ask DNS about name resolution, phone should hops several routers.

I tried 

```
setprop net.dns1 8.8.8.8
setprop net.dns2 8.8.4.4

in `default-gateway-up`, but without success. As a workaround, I set routes to providers DNS through `ORIGINAL_GATEWAY`, but I don't like this idea.

There are some possibilities.
- Pack all binaries (4.1 < and > 5.x | L versions | beta version) in main package and load the appropriate one
- Install basic feature and let user download separate tincd binaries from HTTP
- Install basic feature and let user download separate tincd binaries from google play store

A modul loader will handle the correct binary and install it to the correct location (see issue #https://github.com/Vilbrekin/tinc_gui/issues/28)

Other option is to deploy 3 +x versions in google play store (PIE / non-PIE / beta / ...) but this will not be user friendly.

Vilbrekin/tinc_gui,closed,Use native-code property in the resulting APK,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","The way you package tincd is fine I suppose, but the issue is that the resulting apk does not have a 'native-code' property that tells Android whether it is compatible with its architecture or not. The easy way to support it would be to have the tincd binary under libs/armeabi/tincd (or libs/armeabi-v7a/tincd if you want to support v7a only).

I think the way that res/raw/ and libs/arch/ work is different, I don't know if the latter would work for you. But the problem here is that if I package this for F-Droid, users with e.g. x86 or MIPS will install the app thinking it will work and it magically won't :)

Vilbrekin/tinc_gui,closed,Better building of tinc from source,[],"Changes:
- Use openssl and tinc as git submodules (safer, easier, stays between builds and checkouts)
- Don't just ""git clone"" tinc, which meant using master
- Don't include res/raw/tinc in the repo
- Clean up the Makefile of other unnecessary stuff like the downloading of the NDK

That last bit is secondary, but I still think that having it clutters the Makefile.

Removing the tinc binary from the repo might be a step backwards for out-of-the-box building for newbies, but if you include instructions explaining to do a ""make -C src_tinc/ all install"", it should still be easy enough without having to depend on prebuilts. 

From now on, if you want to update the version of tinc or openssl that you are using, it's as easy as updating the submodules to a newer git tag. You don't have to worry about package urls nor hash sums.

Vilbrekin/tinc_gui,closed,tincd failing on Atrix 4G,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Thanks to Andreas for repoting this issue:

For the last two days i tried to get tinc running on my Motorola Atrix
4G. It is rooted and runs Android Gingerbread (2.3.4). Unfortunately,
every time I tried to start tinc using your tinc GUI, it immediately
reported 'tincd terminated'.
I did some digging and found out that the tincd binary is compiled as
ELF shared object[1]. And somehow my phone is not able to execute such
binaries.
As a result, I compiled my own version of the tincd binary - using the
provided cross compile instructions[2] - removed the '-pie' argument
from the last gcc call, and created an ELF executable[1]. And voila:
tincd is executed and works great on my phone :)

Actually, I am no expert in compiling native code for Android and I am
also not sure what exactly is the difference between a ELF shared object
and an ELF executable. And I absolutely haven't got a clue, why my phone
does not execute shared objects. But maybe this is of interests for you.
Just wanted to give some feedback for phones running older versions of
android.

Andreas

I just noticed that tinc-gui doesn't notice in Manifest that it needs vpn privileges, so then it can't access tun interface, because at least on my device it is:
