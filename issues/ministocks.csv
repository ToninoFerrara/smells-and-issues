niteshpatel/ministocks,closed,Decimal points and commas are not appearing for some users on portfolio input fields,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","This seems to have changed after the last release when I changed the way the input mask is determined by using a key listening instead of input type.

The reason for the change was that the options you can provide when using an input type allow you to include a 'dot' as a key, but not a locale determined decimal separator (which is bizarre).  

Basically the aim is to get only numerals, plus the sign operator where relevant, and the dot or comma as per locale.  Having both dot and comma is acceptable (the edit control will parse the number correctly).
