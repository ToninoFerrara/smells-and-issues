vanilla-music/vanilla-music-lyrics-search,closed,Lyrics window size in version 1.2.0,[],"Hello,
in version 1.2.0,  a clean dialog window has been added in case no lyrics are found. For this, a default, fixed window size has been defined (as the lyrics field is empty anyway).
However, this default, fixed window size is also applied when lyrics are available, whereas the previous behaviour until 1.1.0 was to have a self-adaptative size depending on the number of lyrics lines.
Consequence is that only 5 or 6 lines of the lyrics are visible, which can be a pain for long text and is a pity on a large tablet screen e.g.
--> would it be possible to use the fixed window size only when no lyrics are available and to use the previous self-adaptative size when lyrics are available ?
Thank you in advance."

vanilla-music/vanilla-music-lyrics-search,closed,Feature req: write to sdcard,[],"Hi. Just want to ask if you could add the permission to write to external sdcard. The lyrics can't be saved in the same directory as the mp3s. Being able to browse or configure the default save location to other dirs for saving would be helpful.

Btw, where do the lyrics get saved by default? I copied a test mp3 to the internal drive /sdcard0/Downloads, the file is successfully saved but where? I can't find it, if its in a hidden system dir."
