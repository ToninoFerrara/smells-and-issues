j4velin/SystemAppMover,open,Improve F-Droid listing,[],"I've seen this app on F-Droid, but it lacks screenshots, changelog and a translatable description there. It's pretty easy for you to add these information. Please have a look at [this example](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/tree/master/fastlane/metadata/android) or at the [F-Droid docs](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/#in-the-apps-source-repository) or [fastlane docs](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/2.28.7/supply/README.md#images-and-screenshots).
After you have commited these files to your repo and tagged a new version, you need to remove the `Description` and `Summary` from the metadata file in the [F-Droid Data repo](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata)."

j4velin/SystemAppMover,open,Question: Lolipop support,[],"Is full Lollipop support planned?
Currently. one cannot move system apps in Lollipop.
"
j4velin/SystemAppMover,open,"Checkbox for ""Show user apps""",[],"In your app one can click a checkbox to see also system apps.

However when one is looking for _only_ system apps, it is not possible to blend out user apps.

Therefore I suggest to implement another checkbox for ""Show user apps"". Then each of these option can be toggled independently of each other. So it leads to three views:
- only user apps
- user and system apps
- only system apps

Thanks!

j4velin/SystemAppMover,open,Feature Request: Take apps to be moved from a (user-)supplied list,[],"Your app sounds promising, thanks for making this available. I would welcome if it would offer the possibility to move apps according to a list of apps to be moved which is a typical use case for ""debloating"" a Stock ROM.

As a further enhancement, the app could supply such lists already for some common ROMs/Devices and (as an even further enhancement) try to auto-detect the device being used to apply a matching debloating list.
