onyxbits/TextFiction,open,dictionary integration for non-native speakers,[],"I would love to have the possibility of integrating some freely available dictionary -- like in eBook readers, where you just long press on a word and some bubble pops up, showing a translation, or explanation. 
The reason I'd love to see this is: many years ago I learned English mainly by playing text adventures, starting with ""The Hobbit"" on the ZX Spectrum, later with Infocom games. Now my twelve years old daughter is learning English in school and is in desperate need of motivation. I showed her Wishbringer and she loves playing it using TextFiction on her mobile. However, changing apps for looking up unknown words is pretty cumbersome ... I think this would be a great feature for many people, and especially for language learners. FreeDict.org for example has free dictionaries in a documented XML format.

onyxbits/TextFiction,closed,"Action Bar Menu during game play isn't there to Flip View, ""wait for key mode""",[],"Hello, and thank you for the great software.

I noticed that the screen shots you have on Google Play differ from what I get when I run the app on a device. I've tried both 7"" tablet and 10"" tablet.  Also note that much-older Android devices have a physical ""menu button"" - but that has largely been obsoleted by Google design changes on newer devices.  I tested Text Fiction with an Android 7 and Android 4.2 tablet and had the same problem on both.

An example story of this is Anchorhead (anchor.z8) and the opening screen.  There is a **quote ""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. -- H.P. Lovecraft""** above the story title (or on Flip View in Text Fiction's rendering).

The issue is that the opening screen story title is on the Flip View side and in keystroke (""wait for key mode"") input mode.  I can't find any way to tell Text Fiction to Flip View to view the story title text.  The menus are absent at the top of the screen during story play (looks like commit c9ff779e0ccdbcad0f94b29040e50bad349f0d25 and commit 205c7794d525af99f4a85cb7c089cefd8f97f029 were done after the original Google Play screen shots, removing menu?).  I didn't see any options in the settings to enable the action bar.

EDIT: The Handbook for Text Fiction even has a screen shot depicting the opening screen of Anchorhead:
![alt text](http://www.onyxbits.de/sites/default/files/illustration/138/screenshot.png ""Text Fiction Anchorhead"")


Perhaps I'm overlooking a UI convention, Is there some place to touch or long-touch to bring up the menu or otherwise Flip View?  Thank you."
onyxbits/TextFiction,open,[Suggestion] Option to disable automatic scrolling,[],"Whenever I type a command the response scrolls to reveal the last rows, so I have to scroll up again to read the whole response.

onyxbits/TextFiction,closed,Czech translation created,[],
onyxbits/TextFiction,closed,Icons that respect what is already written,[],"Steps to reproduce:
1. Type ""about""
2. Assign ""about"" to an icon
3. Type ""ask (character name)""
4. Tap the ""About"" icon

Instead of the word ""about"" being added to the end of the already written command, it replaces it.

It's not a bug, I understand the reason for icons replacing what is already written, but it means that it's impossible to have shortcuts for middle words in complex commands like ""ask (character) about (subject)"". That forces me to write, which is inconvenient in a tablet (the keyboard takes some time to appear, it displaces parts of the game screen, I play IF in English but my keyboard is configured for a different language, and it breaks the flow of simply tapping the screen and reading that makes Text Fiction so enjoyable for me).

What I would like is having an option when I configure an icon shortcut to either add that word to what is already written, or the current behaviour.

Thanks!
"
onyxbits/TextFiction,closed,Multiple icon rows,[],"First, I want to thank you for this great app that has finally made me enter the world of IF.

My request is allowing more than one row of icons for abbreviated commands. That way we could have space for a larger number of actions. Writing in tablets is not great, and using your icons plus tapping words is the most enjoyable way of playing IF that I have found so far, writing breaks the flow.

Of course, it would be better if the whole set of icons was not displayed all the time, only the top row, as currently, expanding to the full set with a button or a swiping gesture. The number of available rows could be configurable in preferences.

Hope you consider this suggestion. Thanks!

onyxbits/TextFiction,open,Internationalization request,[],"Hi, I think that this interpreter is very nice. One feature that I would like to see implemented is the support for foreign languages other than English. I'm from Argentina and the native language is Spanish, but loading Spanish version for a game, I can't see the proper characters for some words like ""frío"" (cold), I see ""fr4o"" instead. I know is not something big but is a little annoying anyway :-)

Thanks for all.

"
onyxbits/TextFiction,closed,Add gradle build files; move root of app to /app subdirectory.,[],"I added some Gradle build files and moved the app root to an 'app' subdirectory (makes working with Gradle builds more straightforward). I did not change any Java code or resource files. 'art' is still at the top level. This change should still be compatible with Eclipse (except now you have to import the project from /app subdirectory), but now the project is also accessible to Android Studio/Gradle users. The Gradle wrapper (gradlew/gradlew.bat) is auto-generated boilerplate and generally included for people who do not have Gradle installed.

I noticed /libs is in .gitignore; this means the dependencies of this project are not checked-in and cannot be known to people trying to work with this code. In particular, this project uses support Fragments so the support library is a required, but unspecified, dependency. I added this as a dependency in the Gradle build file, but I think you should just check in /libs to make this more obvious for people not using Gradle.
