"
ushahidi/SMSSync,open,Race condition in publishing can cause messages to be published multiple times,"[Label(name=""Bug report"")]","### Expected behavior

Each message gets only published once, no matter what.
### Actual behavior

With messages waiting in _Incoming_, each press on the publish icon seems to start a publishing thread, even if it is already running.

When there's an issue with the internet or the receiving web service, that makes requests from SMSSync time out, each publishing request takes 30 seconds to time out, making the publishing thread take a long time.
Say you have 20 messages in _Incoming_ due to connection issues and you press the publish button, those 20 messages are picked by a new publishing thread and each attempt to deliver takes 30 seconds.
If you press the publish button again after one minute (thinking it didn't work), another publishing thread is started in parallel, trying to submit the very same messages again.
If the connection starts working again while those threads are still running, the remaining messages in both tasks get sent to the server, resulting in messages being delivered twice.
And if the auto sync job stepped in, they'd even be delivered three times.

The same happens if you accidently hit the publish button multiple times.
### Steps to reproduce the behavior

see above
### Notes

I hope my analysis is correct. If so, the following solutions I'd like to suggest come to my mind:
1. disable ""manual"" publishing as long as it's running. I think at the moment, the loading icon is only displayed until the first of the pending messages has been processed, and the publish button is not disabled at all. I'd suggest to hide the publish button and keep the loading icon until the thread has finished. Unfortunately, this doesn't prevent the auto sync job from stepping in.
2. before allowing any publishing job (manual and auto sync) to run, check if one of both is already running. Still, the publish button should be hidden and the loading icon kept until finished.
3. change the design: in both jobs process messages one by one, taking them ""out"" of the queue (either by moving a message to RAM or better by setting it to a processing status). This change might take too much effort, though.
"
ushahidi/SMSSync,open,Empty response to task checker makes the app crash,[],"### Expected behavior

SMSSync not to crash
### Actual behavior

SMSSync crashes, when it receives an empty response for the task checking request.
### Steps to reproduce the behavior

Enable task checker, let server return an empty response
### Notes

It seems the bug is here: [PostMessage.java#L378](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/54951c1794e24f74e12b3df704fe35b6ddb65efd/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/message/PostMessage.java#L378)

```
 } catch (IOException e1) {
```

When the response is empty, the method `messageHttpClient.getResponse().body()` throws an exception since `getResponse()` returns null. This exception is first catched on [Line 371](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/54951c1794e24f74e12b3df704fe35b6ddb65efd/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/message/PostMessage.java#L371), but when the catch block wants to log the error, it does the `getResponse().body()` call again. That time, only IOExceptions get catched, which doesn't apply and thus makes the app crash.

Imported messages to be published and moved to the Published folder
### Actual behavior

Imported messages don't get published
### Steps to reproduce the behavior

### Notes

With the scenario described above, creating the publish request fails and SMSSync throws the following error when trying to publish an imported message:

```
E/org.addhen.smssync.data.net.MessageHttpClient: Failed to set request body
java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'int java.lang.String.length()' on a null object reference
    at com.squareup.okhttp.FormEncodingBuilder.add(FormEncodingBuilder.java:38)
```

That _null_ object seems to be a missing value for the message_id key - it seems imported messages don't get a uuid on import.
The code different for import on devices >Kitkat: In contrast to Kitkat imports ([ProcessSms.java#L174](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/54951c1794e24f74e12b3df704fe35b6ddb65efd/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/smslib/sms/ProcessSms.java#L174)), messages imported on Lollipop devices don't get a uuid ([ProcessSms.java#L210](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/54951c1794e24f74e12b3df704fe35b6ddb65efd/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/smslib/sms/ProcessSms.java#L210)).

Though this empty line indicates that this is explicitly wanted, copying the line from Kitkat above solved the issue for us.

# Usage
## `MessageHttpClient`

`MessageHttpClient` is mostly used in `PostMessage`.  [`PostMessage` is a singleton](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/message/PostMessage.java#L56), and [maintains a single reference to `MessageHttpClient`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/message/PostMessage.java#L59).
## `AppHttpClient`

This class is mostly used by [`ProcessMessageResult`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/message/ProcessMessageResult.java), which [is also a singleton](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/message/ProcessMessageResult.java#L59) and maintains a single reference to `AppHttpClient`.
# The Problem

`BaseHttpClient` stores the URL to be contacted [in a class property](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/BaseHttpClient.java#L70), which is done at various places:
- https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/MessageHttpClient.java#L113
- https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/AppHttpClient.java#L70
- https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/BaseHttpClient.java#L70 

This value is then read later in [`BaseHttpClient.execute()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/BaseHttpClient.java#L70) (in `prepareRequest()`).

In the intervening time between `BaseHttpClient.mUrl` being set in `setUrl()`, and being read in `execute()`, its value may have changed on another thread.

---

I had initially missed that both HTTP client classes are declared as singletons:
- https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/AppHttpClient.java#L50
- https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/net/MessageHttpClient.java#L53

ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,Shift `threadId` check to before the variable is used,[],
ushahidi/SMSSync,open,SyncPendingMessagesService uniqueness check appears unreliable,[],"# Apparent issues

From reading the code of `SyncPendingMessagesService`, it appears the `isServiceWorking()` method is meant to ensure that only a single instance of the class is ever executing at one time.
## `mService` assignment not safe

`mService` is set without checking if has been set previously: https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/service/SyncPendingMessagesService.java#L89

This appears to mean that if multiple service instance were created, only the most recent will be assigned to `SyncPendingMessagesService.mService`.  Even though one or many older instances could still be running, this will not be reported by `SyncPendingMessagesService.isServiceWorking()`.
## `mService` property not thread-safe

[Shared property `mService`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/service/SyncPendingMessagesService.java#L57) is accessed in a non thread-safe way:
- https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/service/SyncPendingMessagesService.java#L83

In rare cases this could lead to a `NullPointerException` in [`isWorking()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/service/SyncPendingMessagesService.java#L83).
## `isWorking()` will only evaluate `true` at an unspecified time in the future

`isWorking()` returns `true` if the service's `getState().state == SyncStatus.SYNC`.  However, this value is only assigned in [`SyncPendingMessagesTask.syncPending()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/task/SyncPendingMessagesTask.java#L213), which is only called from [`SyncPendingMessagesTask.sync()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/task/SyncPendingMessagesTask.java#L142), which is only called from [``SyncPendingMessagesTask.doInBackground()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/task/SyncPendingMessagesTask.java#L92), which is run, via [this `TaskAsync.execute()` call](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/a1f2224bbb4488a9772eb35a1d8648e0dc350a59/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/presentation/service/SyncPendingMessagesService.java#L114), _on a different thread_.

```
private boolean postMessage(Message message, SyncUrl syncUrl) {

Regardless of the results of `a()` and `b()`, this method will always call `postToWebService` with the same arguments.

---

If this is deliberate, and the code does not rely on Exceptions being thrown in the `a()` and `b()` code, calls to `postMessage(message, syncUrl)` could be replaced with direct calls to `postToWebService(message, syncUrl)`.

ushahidi/SMSSync,open,Log file rotation looks dangerous,[],"# Observed

[`FileManager.rotate()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/cache/FileManager.java#L72) looks like it will have unpredictable results:

The “rotation” occurs, on a separate thread, as follows:
1. the entire logfile is read to count the number of lines
2. the log file is opened again, and the first 30% of the lines are read and discarded
3. the remaining 70% of the old log file is read, and written to the new file

The `PrintWriter` for writing `logFile` is created on the original thread, so it may or may not be created before the rotation is completed.  It is opened in append mode, and it’s not immediately clear which file this will write to (new or old), and if the `Writer` will point to a deleted file if the execution order is as follows:
1. `PrintWriter` created, pointing to `smssync_log`
2. `smssync_log.new` created, and moved to `smssync_log`

Because the rotation is happening on a separate thread, there may be concurrent writes to `smssync_log` while it is also being read and rewritten to the `smssync_log.new` file.
# Suggested fixes

One of the following might improve things:
1. create a new file each run.  You may want to discard e.g. all but the last 10 log files
2. discard previous log file on startup
3. use a third party library with support for log rotation or log file size limits
# Notes

Due to https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/issues/375, the `rotate()` method will currently never be called.

Every append to `FileManager` in the current codebase calls [`FileManager.appendAndClose()`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/cache/FileManager.java#L239), which [closes the underlying `PrintWriter`](https://github.com/ushahidi/SMSSync/blob/master/smssync/src/main/java/org/addhen/smssync/data/cache/FileManager.java#L252).  From the [Java 7 JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html#close%28%29), closing a `PrintWriter` multiple times will have no effect (the [Android JavaDoc makes no mention of this](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/PrintWriter.html#close%28%29)).  The effect of appending to a closed `PrintWriter` is not documented, but from experimentation it seems to have no effect.  This may explain why this bug has not been noticed.

The obvious fix for this is to change all calls to `appendAndClose()` to `append()`.

- Add test for post message.
- Add test for single and multiple messages synchronization.
- Fix #362 - Use the device's phone number for the `sent_to`
  field instead of the `from` number.
- Fix #369 - Set imported messages from the phone's inbox `type`
  to `pending` and `status` to failure. This prevents the app
  from crashing when an attempt is made to fetch messages from the app's
  inbox.
- Swipe to manually sync individual messages in the pending list is
  is broken because there was no method call to cause the sync.
  Made a call to `publishItem(int position)` when a swipe occurs.
- Add test for IP based Integration.
- When Test Ingeration button is hit, the app makes a request using
  configured request method to the server. The test request doesn't
  send the `message` and `from` variables to the server. This sometimes
  causes validation error when the server is strict about those two
  parameters. This sometimes leads to testing of the integration to
  report invalid endpoint has been entered. To fix this, added a
  hardcoded message and from values so those are sent along with the
  secret values. This actually makes the test report that the
  configured integration can actually receive messages from the app.

ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,Not syncing messages from me,"[Label(name=""Bug report"")]","The Android client does not seem to be POSTing to my server all the messages sent FROM me. Messages that I sent to myself are send to my server. I have around 3,000 messages sent TO me and only ~20 sent from me. 

I'm using Android 6.0.1 and SMSSync 2.7.3 and a WSGI Python SMSSync server (it just saves all the POST variables for all messages to a file) behind Apache 2.4. 

Here's what I've figured out so far:

The list of messages gets imported into the local data storage in smssync\src\main\java\org\addhen\smssync\smslib\sms\ProcessSms.java on line 187 in the function importMessageKitKat() because I'm using Android version 6 > KitKat (the check is at ProcessSms.java:152). 
ImportMessageKitKat() queries the OS for the messages using SmsQuery.INBOX_CONTENT_URI as the URI for the query. 
SmsQuery.INBOX_CONTENT_URI is defined to be Telephony.Sms.Inbox.CONTENT_URI in ProcessSMS.java:281, which of course only includes messages in your inbox and does not include messages sent from you (unless they are also to you). See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.Sms.Inbox.html

I can see two possible ways to fix this (but I don't know if they will work):
1. Perhaps we should set SmsQuery.INBOX_CONTENT_URI = Telephony.Sms.CONTENT_URI (<- note the missing ""Inbox"") so it will include ALL text messages. I'm not positive this will give us only one copy of every message. See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.Sms.html
2. Include another variable named SmsQuery.SENT_CONTENT_URI and set it to Telephony.Sms.Sent.CONTENT_URI (See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.Sms.Sent.html) and gather messages from both the Inbox and the Sent messages. We might get duplicates of messages we sent to ourselves.

And in the settings there is a option to set the interval for some actions, but that window where i can pick a time, i only have hours and minutes, and only ""cancel"" button, so i can`t set that value. If i ""click"" outside of the window, it disappear, but not set the value.

The previous version what i found on the f-droid, it is working fine (2.7.3) and i can set the intervals, and this version is actually made requests to the server.

I reply correctly on GET ?task=result with:

and I got the replay on POST ?task=result:
{""message_result"":""[]""}

Note: on documentation the response should be ""message_results"", but actually is ""message_result"".

I've tried with ""SMS Delivery Report"" both enabled or disabled, same behavior.

I've submitted the stack trace via the Google Android error reporting thingie, but was wondering if you guys know about and if it may be useful to you to integrate https://try.crashlytics.com to get more information in case of crashes?

My phone was not on the mobile (not data/WiFi) network as I was inside a building when I've tried the  very first one response - perhaps that's causing others behind it to remain stuck?

Browsing my SIM report I saw that when Smssync send a SMS, a delivery report is requested.
In Italy this is a problem. Why? For every delivered SMS I pay 0.15 Euro for the report.
I'm not a Android programmer, but after downloading the source, I modified a line in the file ProcessSMS.java and I recompiled the APK. 

Original line:
            sms.sendMultipartTextMessage(sendTo, null, parts, sentIntents,
                    deliveryIntents);
Modified line:
            sms.sendMultipartTextMessage(sendTo, null, parts, sentIntents, null);

With this modification, no sending report is requested to my telecom operator.
I suggest to add in the config setting a flag for enabling/disabling delivery report.

Based on the received keyword, SMSSync will send a response back to the sender. This will enable remote debugging to figure out what might be wrong with the phone/server. Here are sample keywords with responses.
Admin sends `sms` to phone running `SMSSync`

**Status**
1. `Is cell reception ok` gets a response `cell reception ok` otherwise no response from SMSSync which means there is something wrong. We can use the [PhoneStateListener](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/PhoneStateListener.html) API for this.
2. `Is server ok` gets a response `server responded with <200>` otherwise sends a reponse `cannot reach server`. Once SMSSync receives the `sms` it will make a request to the server.
3. `battery level` gets a response `battery level is <10%>` otherwise no response from SMSSync which means phone is dead.
4. `get status` gets all of the above responses as a single `sms`

**Alerts**
1. If battery level drops below 10% 
   1. post alert to server
   2. send alert text to stored phone number
1. If an SMS fails to send (due to credit, cell coverage, or bad number)
   1. post alert to server
2. If data connection is lost for extended time (either WiFi, or GSM)
   1. send alert SMS to stored phone number
### Status

To mitigate the issue of having to type a long sentence to query for status response from the phone or the potential of a normal message triggering a status query, it should use an @ prefix and a code instead. See comment by @browndav.

The table below list the query codes, the query, the query's positive and negative responses.

| Query code @xx | Query | \+ Query response | \- Query response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@10` | `Is cell reception ok` | `cell reception ok` | The phone sends no response. |
| `@20` | `Is server ok` | `server responded with <HTTP Status Code> status code` eg. `server responded with 200 status code` | `Cannot reach server` |
| `@30` | `battery level` | `battery level is <percentage of battery level>` . eg. `battery level is 10%` | The phone sends no response. |
| `@40` | `get status` | all the query's positive responses | all the query's negative responses |

The query codes sent as SMS shouldn't be sent to the configured `Sync URL`
### Alerts
#### Scenario 1

If battery level of the device running SMSSync drops below 10%, SMSSync will make an HTTP GET request to the server with the following query params.
`?task=alert&message=battery level is at <percentage of battery level>`

At the same time, SMSSync will send SMS with the message `battery level is at <percentage of battery level>` to a phone number that has been configured at the Settings screen to receive alerts. For now it should be only one phone number and cannot be the phone number of the device.
#### Scenario 2

If SMSSync failed to send SMS due to error reported by [sendMultipartTextMessage](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SmsManager.html#sendMultipartTextMessage%28java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.util.ArrayList<java.lang.String>, java.util.ArrayList<android.app.PendingIntent>, java.util.ArrayList<android.app.PendingIntent>%29) make an HTTP GET request to the server with the following query params. `?task=alert&message=<error message>` See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SmsManager.html for the error messages.
#### Scenario 3

If data connection is lost for extended time (either WiFi, or GSM)
Send SMS with the message `No data connection on the device` to the configured phone number.

The problem with this is that it's impossible to track which sms succeeded and which failed, so one can know which ones to try to resend, drop from subscription, etc. 

I think an elegant solution would be to have all tasks appear in the pending tray when they are synced from the server.  Once they are successfully sent, they should appear in the sent tray. Hitting the sync button would then try to resend these tasks if they have not been deleted.

Ideally the phone would still send messages without a country prefix (for example, in the UK `07123456789` is the same as `+447123456789`).

An idea for a new setting in the settings page:

```
Limit message sending to:
      +------------------+
 [x]  | e.g. +254        |
      +------------------+
```

Possible problems:
- The app can't inform the server that a message has not been sent (yet - see issue #11).
- Is there an easy way to detect whether a number has the country code attached? I know there are lots of oddities with different countries having different [international calling prefixes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_call_prefixes), so if configured this way, the server would _have_ to send the `+44` version, instead of (for example) `00447123456789` (which would work in the UK, but not in Kenya who would need to dial `0447123456789`).

ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,Show user any erroneous HTTP response codes,[],"When the server sends any unsuccessful [HTTP response code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) (such as 4XX Client Errors or 5XX Server Errors), the user is presented with the same generic error message as with any other problem:

> SMSSync message sending failed. Perhaps it's not configured or there is no Internet connection. Please double check your Internet connection or your configuration.

This hinders debugging, and it would be much more useful to see an error such as:

> SMSSync message sending failed. Sync URL returned error code 404.

Given that most users will be at least slightly technical, showing the actual response code from the server could at least allow them to google the issue.

As for what happens to 3XX (Redirect) status codes, I am not sure how these are/should be handled, but unless the redirect is automatically obeyed, these 'error' codes should also be shown to the user. Ideally, of course, a redirect should be followed, but that's another story.
"
ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,Custom error messages from server.,[],"The server sends the following JSON response on failure:

``` javascript
{
    payload: {
        success: ""false""
    }
}
```

When receiving this status, the app gives a notification along the lines of:

> SMSSync message sending failed. Perhaps it's not configured or there is no Internet connection. Please double check your Internet connection or your configuration.

I propose that we allow an extra ""error"" field in the response, along the lines of:

``` javascript
{
    payload: {
        success: ""false"",
        error: ""The supplied secret key was invalid.""
    }
}
```

The only down-side is that error messages would have to be translated on the server, if required.

Examples server responses:
- The unique ID was not specified.
- The provided unique ID is not recognized.
- The supplied secret key was invalid.
- Your account has exceeded its quota for syncing.
- Your account has been deactivated.
- The server is experiencing issues. Please try again later.

Of course, a message similar to that currently shown, should still be shown in the case that the server is unreachable.

ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,Design Principles > Menu re-arrangement suggestion,[],"I can see that effort has been made to keep the required menu elements within view, when switching between the three panes (pending / sent / sync url), the possible menu buttons change.

I think an improvement, in line with the google recommended design guidelines<sup>&dagger;</sup>, would be to move these into a drop-down menu for extra options by default. It would be nice to have access to the settings page from all tabs, for example, and it would also allow a brief word or two describing what the action would do. This is particularly important, since some of the icons are not self-explanatory themselves.

To give a better idea of this issue, viewing the screen in landscape or portrait gives different options (at least on my device). Screenshots of inconsistencies attached. :)

As you can see, the above menu layouts are inconsistent. It's great that only relevant options are available, but in portrait mode there's not enough space for this. I'm suggesting we use one of these (which should solve all the problems):

ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,"Disable unnecessary ""no task enabled"" notifications",[],"When automatically fetching tasks (for instance, every 2 minutes), the app sends a toast notification along the lines of:

""No task is enabled on the configured Sync URL.""

This can get in the way (or at least be an irritation) when using the phone for other purposes.

I've patched my own fork of the code by simply commenting out the offending lines:

```
else {
  showToast(context, R.string.no_task);
}
```

in `MessageSyncUtil.java`, and it's a vast improvement!

I attempted to create this as a further option in the settings, but then considered that it might be a bit overkill to allow this to be customised.

Thanks,

I've logged an error on that of Ushahidi.   But, if I manually change the my database so that one of my e-mail alerts is an SMS subscriber, and put a test report in that subscribers radius. Nothing is sent.  

Can I get any confirmation that Mobile alerts are indeed working with Ushahidi 2.5? And if so, maybe some support?  

I'm not strictly a developer, but I'm comfortable with messing around with things in the backend. I just don't know exactly what to look for at this point.

For example by sending a well defined query to the server that then responded. I am imagining someone in a country disconnected from the server trying to setup the gateway and not knowing if it is set up right, and that a TEST button would be useful .

Maybe the TEST button could send a copy of the settings, and get back feedback … For example we will need to make sure the phone is set to Poll the server for outgoing SMS, and I am seeing as a significant failure point being the likelihood that the owner of the Phone sets up the gateway incorrectly and that we are trying to debug this by international phone call from the US for example.

A test button would also help debug the server (something I’m trying to do now) with otherwise no way to generate the JSON calls

ushahidi/SMSSync,closed,Incompatible with Galaxy Nexus (Continuation of #18),[],"## Comment below was posted a week ago on closed issue #18, submitting now as new issue:

With the ICS fix in v1.1.10 the app opens and displays in Galaxy Nexus (4.0.2) but it crashes when I try to sync.

Here is what I've noticed, not sure how much of this is related to the feature not being complete, or it being related to the phone:

I can import messages in the Pending view but they are immediately labelled as Failed.

App does not sync with sync button (says ""There are no messages to send"" and ""No pending messages"" is displayed overtop of the list of pending messages).

If I hold down on the messages and then sync one of all, the app crashes. This occurs even if the sync url is empty.

I can fill out the Add Sync URL form in the SYNC URL view, but anything I enter there does not get saved. I can still use the traditional Settings menu to Enter The Sync URL.

If i select a message in the Pending view the checkbox does not get checked, but the message text goes from grey to white.

Let me what additional information you would need to figure this out, would be glad to help out in any way possible.

``` json
callback: {
  url: 'http://something.com/path',
  params: {""foo"":""bar""},
  method: ""POST""
}
```

Before I embark on supporting this type of functionality I thought I would consult.  Let me know if this is something you might find useful or how you might architect something like this, or if it fits.

Also it seems there is some confusion in the current callback term used within the application and docs that refer to a callback URL but it really seems more like a polling URL, or task polling.  I would like to support both polling and callbacks, by callback I mean one http call that prompts another by providing a configuration similar to above in the response.
