termux/termux-widget,closed,script not executing external commands,[],"I've been facing a frustrating error when executing Nodejs/bash scripts in Termux-Widget app.

**Android**: 7.1.1
**Node**: 9.11.1
**NPM**: 6.1.0
**Termux**: 0.61
**Termux-Widget**: 0.8

I saved a Nodejs script in $HOME/.shortcuts as usual.

    #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/env node

    const { exec } = require(""child_process"");
  
     exec(""npm -v"", (err, stdout) => {
       if(err) {
         console.log(err);
         return;
       }
       console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
     });

When i execute this script in the shell with `node test.js`, I get the expected result, which is the current version of my installed npm. But when i execute it using the Termux-Widet, it outputs following error message:

    err: Error: Command failed: npm -v
    /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh: 1: npm: not found

**Obs 1**: The same output was given when I tried `npm -v` using bash language.

**Obs 2**: It doesn't execute commands like **npm** and **ng generate...**, but do execute **ls** and **cd**

**Obs 3**: I already tried **termux-fix-shebang** and **termux-exec**.

**Obs 4**: In the same script, when i execute the following snippet, it lists NPM inside /bin directory.

    exec(""ls /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin"", (err, stdout) => {
      console.log(stdout);
    });

    ...
    node
    nohup
    npm
    nproc
    npx
    ...

If it's not related to the approach used, i guess there's a bug, or not notified feature, in the execution context of Termux-Widget, because inside the script, it lists NPM package, but doesn't execute it at all."
termux/termux-widget,open,[wishlist] Support .desktop files,[],"Current shortcuts are typically command-line programs that use stdin/out and have a delimited life time. With [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_497__rethinking_the_android_port/) [coming to termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/420), the possibility of other webapp-style local apps following, as well as envisioning the consequenes of an [SDL2 port to termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/51), those might be only a part of what we might want to launch from a desktop icon. Scripts that utilize `termux-toast` or `termux-dialog` likely would also prefer to indicate that they don't need the background terminal.

I suggest that [Linux desktop files](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html) be adopted for that purpose. termux-widget could not only look for executable files in `~/.shortcuts`, but also for .desktop files as `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/**/*.desktop`. Those files could state a localized name of the launcher, an icon, carry custom metadata (like for #20 / #10) and indicate whether a terminal window should be shown at all by setting the `Terminal` key.

(Alternatives are assuming that everything is shell script and putting metadata in comment lines after the shebang (a practice that has some spread but which I deplore), or Windows 3.1 style [PIF files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_information_file)).

Games like `moria` already have appropriate .desktop files in their Debian packages, and could thus easily become launcher-enabled through termux-widget, complete with name and icon. (Or through a successor to termux-widget, if it turns out that .desktop files are the way to go but termux-widget should stay and there'd be another app that implements .desktop files)."

termux/termux-widget,open,Allow files to be opened with a shortcut,[],"When in a file browser, users can open files with eligible apps. Users can select termux to open a file, which will make termux to copy the file to Downloads.

It would preferable, if termux could make use of the shortcuts defined for termux-widget to open a file sent to termux.

Example:

- Define a shortcut for VIM
- Open a file from a file browser and send it to termux
- Choose the VIM shortcut to handle the file
- The file is opened in vim and the user won''t hardly notice vim isn't a native android app.

There actually is no need to copy the file to Downloads first, since the storage is available via 
 ~/storage/shared once termux-setup-storage is run.

termux/termux-widget,open,Option to restore sessions from widget,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","_From @kokoko3k on March 2, 2017 9:54_

Would it be possible, or maybe it already is, to restore opened sessions when tapping an entry on the widget, instead of launching a new one?

To be clear,
-make an ssh shortcut to a remote server
-start it
-do not close/disconnect from it
-start it again

You ends having 2 connections to the same server, i would like to have a way to choose the running one.

For me personally, this is a the most important feature that Termux needs. It would allow for communication between apps like Tasker and Termux. 

Examples that I would like to do:
- Launch a backup script at a certain time, location and if plugged in with Tasker (I have that, it retries if it fails for some reason. Yesterday my internet didn't work and in the morning I had to close 137 Termux sessions)
- Get the output of a command with Tasker and add it to a Zooper or Minimalistic Text widget. (Like [this](https://oliverse.ch/tech/2016/02/16/display-output-of-a-bash-script-on-a-widget.html), but without the need for a constantly running Termux loop)

Another issue is with the ""All Shortcuts"" widgets, if I add this and then reboot it also doesn't work. Initially it says ""No files in $HOME/.shortcuts"". After a minute or so the list of scripts appears and I can run the scripts. However, no matter how long I wait the single shortcut shortcuts don't start working again.
