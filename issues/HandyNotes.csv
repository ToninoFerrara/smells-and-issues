Maybe you could use an implementation like this:

``` java
public String showNoteText(int wId) throws SQLException {
    String result = """";

    Cursor mCursor =
          mDb.query(true, DATABASE_TABLE, new String[] {KEY_ROWID, KEY_BODY}, KEY_ROWID + ""="" + wId, null,
                    null, null, null, null);

    if (mCursor != null) {
        mCursor.moveToFirst();

        if (mCursor.getCount() > 0) {
            result = mCursor.getString(mCursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_BODY));
        }
        mCursor.close();
    }

    return result;

    }
```

atd/HandyNotes,open,"allow to use HandyNotes as an app, not only as a widget",[],"Please allow to use HandyNotes as an app, not only as a widget. 

Currently HandyNotes can only be used as a widget: You add a widget on screen, enter some text and have it displayed there. This will of course work for many people, but not for all. As far as I'm concerned I don't need/want to have my notes so visible on the phone desktop. And they take a lot of space: 
- If you want to have one note per widget, you will end up with a nr of widgets cluttering the desktop; 
- If you want to put all your notes in one single note and keep the widget small, you might as well use a simple text editor for that; 
- If you want to put all your notes in one single note and use a big widget, then it would take too much space. 

I would suggest that you add an 'app mode' to HandyNotes. It could work as follows: 
- The app can be run as any Android app, via desktop shortcut or Quickdroid
- Loading the app will present the user with an 'add note' button and a list of notes
- Hitting the button will create a note and bring up the current 'edit note' mode
- Hitting any item in the list will pop up the same 'edit note' mode
- Long-pressing any item will bring up a context-menu with the Edit and Delete options

The interface would be very simple, similar to AK Notepad or (the incomplete) Tomdroid, but the usability would be greatly enhanced.

I really like your app but after some time, the notes can't be edited anymore (but can be moved around, deleted). Some can be added too.

Hope it can be fixed,
