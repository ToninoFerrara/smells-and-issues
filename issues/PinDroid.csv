Would it be possibly to replace or supplement that with a feature like that in the particular-pinboard.js chrome extension, where there is essentially a list of keywords from the selected text which, if present, will automatically populate the tag field with user-chosen keywords. This allows for really useful customising on an individual basis -- eg, I might want all references to YouTube automatically tagged ""adtech"" but another user might want them tagged ""video"" instead.

When I press the Sign In button, I briefly see the ""Authenticating"" message box and then PinDroid crashes.

I tried to following workarounds but not of them worked:
- moved PinDroid to the internal storage
- cleared the data and the cache
- reinstalled

maxpower47/PinDroid,open,Searching for multiple tags at a time,[],"A major advantage of Pinboard over simple synched browser bookmarks is multitagging. PinDroid supports this when adding a link (multiple tags can be assigned to one link), but (afaik) not in search: I can only enter *one* tag in the search edit or choose *one* from the list, but I can't search for links with a specific combination of tags. This makes searching in larger link collections like mine a bit tedious.

The best solution in my point of view would be to mimic the behavior of the Pinboard website, where you can select a tag and then it stays active and limits your link list until you unselect it, plus a list of suggested tags you can select to further limit your search.

An ad-hoc solution and probably easier to implement would be to allow entering multiple tags in the search edit field."

I've found some accessibility issues in your app and I have fixed some of them as you can see in my commits. The main problems are related to:
- small touchable area: clickable elements dimension should have at least 48dp x 48dp
- Label, or speakable text: clickable images should have a content description so screen readers can inform users what is the action related to that image or image button. 
- contrast: contrast ratio between foreground and background should be at least 3 (I haven't fixed any contrast related issue).

Good to see you back improving PinDroid! Any chance to fix the following issue, since you've added pull-to-sync in the latest version?

When I pulled-to-sync, the sync was performed, but the timestamps of all bookmarks was wrong. At pinboard.in, everything appears bookmarked as ""yesterday"", when in fact I had bookmarked those pages 1 to 3 weeks ago.

maxpower47/PinDroid,closed,Support for Travis continuous integration,[],"In case you don't know what continuous integration is, I'll just explain briefly: it will make sure the project is kept stable, and you won't even have to run the tests locally. (btw, they don't even compile currently :) ). Travis will run it against multiple android versions in parallel on emulator and report the failures if any.

To enable it, if you merge this, you are gonna need steps 2 and 3 from [this guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners).

After that, you are gonna have pretty checks for all pull requests, so you can figure out if it is safe to merge them. Even though coverage is low currently and one has to run the app to test it, you could at least know if the PR to your project even compiles before checking it out and building. (I also could help with actual test coverage later)

You've probably saw these checks on github, but in case you haven't, check [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/pulls) as an example: PRs which passed the tests have this green tick, ones which failed are marked with red crosses, pending ones are marked with yellow dot.

I've also added [this fancy status image](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/) to readme.md, so everyone will see that the app is passing the tests and in healthy state. I've substituted your username in it, so currently it doesn't work since Travis is not set up for you, but should start if you set it up and merge the PR :)

I've tested this configuration on my fork and it works fine: https://travis-ci.org/karlicoss/PinDroid/builds/126757721

Hope you'll like it!

P. S. choice of APIs is kinda arbitrary, I just picked the minimum one available on emulator, the target API, and other more or less at random. Anyway, it's free to run against multiple, they are being run on parallel.

maxpower47/PinDroid,closed,Sign-in (re-authentication) confusion,[],"I recently did some pinboard API usage by hand, then decided to reset my auth token.

Next day there was a notification on my phone about PinDroid failing to sign in.

Seemed reasonable, since I reset my auth token...
Except that the app wouldn't authenticate with my new auth token.

Does the app work with username/token?
Or is username/password required?
Or does the app log out after a long period of time?

If it failed to authenticate because I changed my token, I would think it would have worked with my new token.

If it originally required my password, then I don't understand why it got logged out.

maxpower47/PinDroid,closed,Major battery drain when re-authentication is required,[],"I usually go about 3 days without needing to recharge my phone.
Went to bed last night with 80% charge.
Woke up with 3% charge.

There was a notification about failure to authenticate with pinboard.

The battery continued to drain quickly (and recharge slowly) until I successfully reauthenticated.

It's possible that there was another reason the battery was draining, but this seemed to be the only unusual thing happening on the phone at the time.

maxpower47/PinDroid,open,Redirect-happy URLs render app unusable on tablet,[],"With the tablet view, clicking a bookmark that immediately triggers a redirect on load (ex: mobile version) bounces to the browser; then clicking back reloads the redirecting URL, bouncing to browser again.

Have a fix in progress, but it's kind of hackish (involves a fair amount of overriding in WebView). Can make a PR if that's acceptable.
