- Rename `gift-card-guard` to `Gift Card Guard` so that it corresponds to the published app name.
- Link an F-Droid button just like I added via pull request on another project called [Binaural Beats](https://github.com/GiorgioRegni/Binaural-Beats).
- Seems like you copied the `README` of your other project, otherwise this sentence would be erased:

> If there is any interest in improving this open source **baby monitor**, kindly submit a pull request with proposed changed.

  - [Here](http://www.onbarcode.com/products/java_barcode/) is a guide on how to manage bar codes in Java

  - It should show the card ID too
