uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,Add intent filters for https URLs,[],"Most Debian services are preferring https URLs now.  Adding intent filters for the https schema restores DebianDroid as an application that can handle those URLs.
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,Do not show Uploaders when empty,[],"In package view, when Uploaders is empty, `[}]` is shown. I think that could be omitted. 
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,Modify the input type of the bug search field based on search type,[],"Currently, the bug search field is just a plain text search field.  It would be nice if that changed based on the type of search being performed.  For example, setting the search type to `by number` would `setInputType(TYPE_CLASS_NUMBER)` and searching `submitted by` would `setInputType(TYPE_CLASS_TEXT | TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_EMAIL_ADDRESS)`.

"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,Change http scheme to https on some services,[],"Since some Debian have https enabled services and the code don't seem to follow
HTTP 301 redirects, directly use https urls when available.

I don't have tested these changes by rebuilding the application but just noted the failure on last version 1.732 when using an http proxy on search_packages, rcbugs, etc...
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,Minor build system issues,[],"Hello @uberspot,

We're keeping this app up to date in F-Droid. Could you please use git tags? It would make our job easier. Also, project.properties has one small isusue - sed -i 's/StorageUtils/storageutils/g' project.properties

Apart from that, everything builds perfectly.

Thanks!
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,Private submodules,[],"Can you make the submodules point to public repos and fix the project.properties  to point to the them (storage one doesn't)?
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,UDD lists,[],"I should be able to tap on a bug in the UDD list of bugs and open the bug in the Bug Tracking part of the application. Similarly, I should be able to open a package from the UDD list (and, perhaps also the Debian FTP list) of latest uploads in Package Tracking.
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,closed,back button does nothing,[],"I expect the back button to bring me to the previous view within the application. All it does is bring me to the previous application.
"
uberspot/DebianDroid,open,Provide access to buildd logs,[],"It would be great to be able to access buildd logs. Specially from the pts page.

Thanks!
