Great game!
I wanted to play it on my Fire TV box using the keypad buttons on the remote.
This patch connects the keypad button events to the existing touch button controls.
Thanks for merging!

vocollapse/Blockinger,closed,Screen burn-in on Super AMOLED,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I just played Blockinger for the first time for about 15 minutes. After the game closed, I noticed the game buttons had been burned on to the screen. Apparently this is something that can happen to Super AMOLED (or simply any OLED technology) screens. An explanation for the cause begins here in this thread:

http://forums.androidcentral.com/sprint-epic-4g/34170-question-screen-burn.html#post401245

My issue was only temporary but noticeable because of the high contrast between the white buttons on the black blackground. Decidedly, I could fix the problem myself by turning the brightness down on the phone (it's supposed to automatically adjust to the ambient light but it doesn't). But you may want to provide an option to change the button colors to further alleviate this issue or just change the button colors to a light grey or blue or whatever you like to lessen the contrast a little bit. 

One other thing: How about making the fast-drop button a different color from the rotate buttons? Several times I forgot which buttons were which and accidentally dropped pieces instead of rotating them. I don't have time to look at the button icons so a different color would make it stand out better. 

Beautiful game, BTW.
