I was looking at issue #158 and decided to try and fix it. I found out that having an intent-filter exposes an activity externally even with exported=false. Removing them fixes the issue and everything still works as normal.

The second thing in this PR is removing HN from the 'share' menu. I noticed that it didn't work so I was going to try and fix it. However, I realised that it's probably not needed as the user can't actually post using this app (and any links they click on should be picked up by the VIEW intent and sent to the app anyway rather than using the SEND intent).

Update: Also added http links to the intent. Links on the actual website will be https but other links could be http (probably fixes #166).

Update: reverted a commit that introduced a small bug (""not valid"" message shown when loading HN homepage from external link).

Let me know what you think :).

But sadly with this information, the [More] button seems to be gone, too.

(To reproduce this behavior, just put your device into 'flight mode' before using the [More] button).

For example. If you've used the [More] button several times before and the button hides on some point (because of a bad connection), than you have to reload from the beginning and hit the [More] button the number of the {several times} before, to be on the right place in your history again.

Cool would be:
- not to hide the [More] button after that kind of connection errors,
- and/or rename the [More] button in [Retry] in that kind of cases, to indicate what happened with the query-request before.

manmal/hn-android,closed,"Add action bar DON'T MERGE INTO MASTER YET, PULL THIS BRANCH",[],"Alright, so I took the liberty of doing most of this over the past couple of days, but finals are coming up, and if I don't submit this now I'll probably fail because I'll do no studying.  I've outlined all the changes below.  Let me know if you want to change any history because there are a lot of commits here.

What's here:
An integration of ActionBarCompat with all activities using Gradle/Android Studio.  I used ABC because it's finally mature enough to handle all this and it is likely what other apps will start using going forward.  Plus, all the documentation is pretty much identical for both of them.
Requisite cleanup of all layout files
Recreation of most of the features that were present on the old Action Bar

What's missing/broken:
Testing on pre-3.0 builds and real devices
Styling of the dropdown menus from the overflow menu (this is done by setting `DropDownListViewStyle` in the themes)
Styling the overflow icons appropriately.  They show up blue when tapped.  I'm not sure how to change this
Integration with Eclipse builds
For some reason the comment bubbles got huge with this.  I think it is an issue with scaling, but I really couldn't lock it down.

Stuff that was lost:
You can no longer tap the action bar to scroll you up to the top of a comments list.  I think this is just theoretically incompatible with the way custom views are added.  I think that implementing one of the suggestions here: http://cyrilmottier.com/2013/01/09/back-to-top-android-vs-ios/ will be a good way to make up for this.

Further thoughts:
I'm not sure if having just the up arrow is the best way to go about things going forward, as it introduces some buginess with touch targets it seems.  Maybe creating an icon and having a normal up arrow would be the way to go.  As it stands now the app icon does a pretty bad job as a home icon though.

Anyway, I'll be around to support this however possible.

Since the previous query just grabbed the direct children of the `.comment` element, this caused the latter type of comment to not have it's proper line breaks inserted because of how the `html` method in Jsoup works.

manmal/hn-android,closed,should sharing from the comments view send the HN comments page URL?,[],"In other HN readers, I've found it really useful to be able to share either the article URL or the comments URL depending on context. The comments URL is a handy shared item because the HN comments page always links to the article URL. Thus, if the HN comments turn out to be more useful than the article, it's nice to share/bookmark those instead of the article itself.

manmal/hn-android,closed,"sharing: ""Share Article URL"" is attached to share data as title",[],"Disclaimer: I am not an Android developer, so apologies for any misguided notions about how sharing works.

I'm seeing this issue when sharing from hn-android to pindroid (a free pinboard.in client). When sharing from hn-android - and only hn-android - the ""title"" field in pindroid is populated with ""Share Article URL"". From other apps, pindroid is able to populate the title field with the content of the page's title tag.

I would expect hn-android to either pass the title tag's content or pass nothing (to allow the shared-to app to detect a no-title condition and fetch on its own, if that's how it works).

manmal/hn-android,closed,Visiting link through comments ignores browser settings,[],"Thanks for the latest update to give us an option of different reading settings.

I have it set to use system browser, and it works fine when visiting a link from the list of articles. However going from list -> comments -> article defaults back to using the in app browser.

Could you please update that link to obey browser settings as well? Thanks.
