andstatus/andstatus,closed,Search by a part of a word,"[Label(name=""New feature"")]","> George Dorn @gdorn
> @AndStatus how do I filter all posts containing links to a specific domain?  Is substring matching not a thing, or have I just not found the right wildcard character?
( https://social.coop/@gdorn/100244759788431726 )

Currently #AndStatus can show timelines filtered by full words or by quoted phrases, containing full words only. This is why, for example, domain name loadaverage.org can be found only in a case it is typed as a separate word, like in this post, and not as a part of the URL with a path inside this domain.
We need to adopt some syntax to tell the application that substring search should be used. #ActivityPub doesn't mention any query syntax. So in order to filter by a part of URL I think that Twitter's ""premium"" :-) syntax could be used, e.g.:

`contains:loadaverage.org`

or even:

`contains://loadaverage.org/`

in order to avoid matching with longer domain names.
See https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/rules-and-filtering/overview/premium-operators.html"
andstatus/andstatus,closed,Need to know from which account it's a message at combined timeline,[],"Hi!

I'm using AndStatus with 3 GNU Social accounts from the same node so I'd like to use a combined timeline but in that case I can't distinguish which message it's from each account and having common followed accounts sometimes I did reply with the wrong own account.

Could be possible to difference each message account by for example the avatar or a different background colour?

I think we talk about it some years ago in GNU Social but maybe it's not implemented.

Until now I have different accounts at different nodes and I can see the node written at the message header, but now I'm running my own GNU Social node and it's the same for the 3 accounts so no way to difference it and I can't use combined timelines.

we want to allow a User to see that somebody favorited his/her note (in Notifications timeline)
AND ""somebody favorited something by otheruser:"" words should be automatically removed from all incoming notes.

Using #ActivityPub terminology, AndStatus should::
1. Detect GNU Social ""favoriting actions"" formatted like ordinary notes (using ""somebody favorited something by otheruser:"" ""favoriting prefix"") during processing of downloaded timelines.
2. And convert such notes into LIKE actions of original (""favorited"") notes. Text of that ""original"" note should be re-constructed by removing the ""favoriting prefix"".
As a result, timelines won't contain that ""somebody favorited something by otheruser:"" words, but will have LIKE (favoriting) actions of somewhat not fully reconstructed ""favorited notes""...

As a side effect, this change will make timeline opening a bit faster, as the application won't need to search for that  ""somebody favorited something by otheruser:"" - it does this now in order to collapse duplicates..."

andstatus/andstatus,closed,Add apk signature to a Crash report,"[Label(name=""UX enhancement"")]","As the ACRA team didn't do this yet for all its users, we are implementing this first for AndStatus app.
See related ticket in ACRA project: https://github.com/ACRA/acra/issues/493

This is very handy to identify problems in Open Source projects and identify a source of the package. E.g. AndStatus application is distributed both by Development team and by f-droid, with different signatures. And users can also build the application themselves and then send their crash reports...

And this feature is very easy to implement, please see https://www.airpair.com/android/posts/adding-tampering-detection-to-your-android-app

Reporting if the signature is valid is necessary also, but not enough.

More details:
First of all, for the case of most of applications, available in f-droid repository (see https://f-droid.org/ ) more than one ""valid"" signature exists, because f-droid builds and signes apks itself. Plus development team, naturally, signs its build of apk with the dev team's signature. So we have large number of users with these two ""valid"" signatures.
It also happens that a user decides to build apk himself (real cases!).

Now imagine that I receive a crash report saying that it occurred in AndStatus application v.27.04 and I cannot reproduce the bug reported or I cannot believe that the crash could happen. Having an apk signature in the report will immediately give me an answer about the origin of the apk: f-droid, me (Google Play store mostly) or unknown user's signature.

This simplest way of doing this is by adding the signature as a custom property

andstatus/andstatus,open,"Add ""Interactions"" Timeline","[Label(name=""New feature"")]","As I see, Twidere has a timeline called ""Interactions"": it contains mentions of / replies to my account(s). ""Interactions"" timeline in Twidere is the same or close to existing ""Mentions"" timeline in AndStatus.
Actually ""Mentions of me"" and ""Replies to me"" are not the only types of messages, which comprise ""Interactions"". 

In AndStatus we are creating the ""Interactions"" timeline, which shows:
- Mentions of ""me"" (my accounts, registered in AndStatus) and my mentions of other users.
- Replies to me and my replies to other users.
- Direct messages to and from me.

Maybe also (to be decided...):
- Favoriting of my messages and my favoriting of other users' messages
- Reposting/Retweeting/""Sharing"" of my messages and my ""reposting/sharing actions""

andstatus/andstatus,closed,Search for words or for exact phrase,"[Label(name=""New feature"")]","Currently, when you write this in a Search box:
`my interactions`
 AndStatus actually _locally_ searches for the exact phrase: ""my interactions"", and sends search requests to different networks exactly as you typed the search query, leaving to the Social Networks to interpret the query.

It appears that Twitter interprets above query as:
`Search for tweets, which contain both ""my"" and ""interactions""`
i.e. Twitter returns more tweets than AndStatus shows to a User. And Twitter has another syntax for the exact phrase:
`""my interactions""` (see [documentation on search in Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search)).

As a step of a search enhancement here we are going to implement a way to query for both a phrase and a separate words.

@rodneyrod We have only generic donation way now: http://andstatus.org/donate.html
But reading on https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bountysource I just realised that addition of something like that for crowdfunding specific features may allow to attract new developers to the project, who would be payed for implementation of that specific features in a case funders agree with implementation and the code was merged into the main project source code repository... I.e. to crowdsouce the project.

andstatus/andstatus,closed,GNU Social: downloading image when authentication required,[],"##### Context
- On GNU Social `a` instance where access to anything is restricted to accounts registered on `a`.
- A post that contains a link to an image hosted on `a`.
- (The image is visible when using the web interface.)
##### Expected behavior
- The image is loaded from the server `a` and then displayed in the Andstatus timeline.
##### Observed behavior
- The image is not displayed in the timeline.
- Not sure if the image is actually downloaded.
##### Suspicion & Suggested fix
- Image download requires authentication (to ensure that only registered account are able to access them) but Andstatus does not authenticate the user.
- Check HTTP status code of image download.
  - A test without authentication (e.g. with `curl`) resulted in a `HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect` to the login page.
  - Thus if download (from the server where the user has his/her account) fails with `307` retry authenticated.

andstatus/andstatus,open,Warning if acting in a conversation as a different user,"[Label(name=""New feature"")]","If a User has several accounts in one Social network or in different connected Social networks (e.g. in different GNU Social instances), this User usually wants to take part in one conversation as one User, and don't mix different ""personas"" in one context.
AndStatus allows to ""Act as"" any available User in one Social network. But situation may be more difficult, when the same conversation is observed by different accounts from e.g. different GNU Social instances.

AndStatus could scan already loaded part of a conversation and find out that you already took part in this conversation using your another account (and via another GNU Social instance!). And it could show you some large warning on this. 

The warning could be shown not only on Replying (this is the most obvious case), but on Reposting or favoriting some message in the same conversation.

See https://loadaverage.org/conversation/7583424 and https://loadaverage.org/conversation/7740640#notice-7982542

Meanwhile:
1. GNU Social declares support of Activity Streams in Atompub and JSON formats. See https://gnusocial.net/doc/api
2. The Activity Streams format specification ( JSON format !) got a follow up, which we may become confirming to in order to ease integration with other systems: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/

It looks like no GNU Social client application uses Activity Streams JSON format to connect to GNU Social yet. So maybe this doesn't work at all now, or is implemented wrong...
Anyway we should try, uncover what is good and what should be done by GNU Social developers to allow AndStatus migration from ""Twitter compatible API"" to ""Activity Streams"".

andstatus/andstatus,closed,[pump.io] Real 'share' activities,[],"Currently, sharing a Pump.io post with AndStatus does not create a 'share' activity. Instead, it creates a new post, without a title if there was one (which then is **lost**), with a total loss of formatting, and with a weird reference to the original user (in the post text itself), and a non-clickable-link to the original post.

I think creating a real 'share' activity would be much, much better, and also, really easier, code-wise. Creating a 'share' activity is really simple:
`""verb"": ""share"",
  ""object"": {""id"": ""whateverID"" }`

I understand that AndStatus supports several networks, and the current way is necessary to share something from Pump to the other networks, but it would be great if that new ""cross-post-share"" was posted only to the other networks, and to Pump, a real 'share' activity was created instead.

andstatus/andstatus,closed,[pump.io] Create proper HTML links,"[Label(name=""New feature"")]","Pump.io uses HTML for posts and comments.
AndStatus does not generate HTML in the posts it creates. This is fine when people are just writing words, but it becomes a problem when someone posts a http link, because that's posted as just text, and does not generate a real, clickable link.

I'm not asking for AS to let the user create pretty links, where any word in the message can be a link to something, just that when a user enters a ""http://something"" address, that should be converted to a proper <A HREF... tag.

It would be really useful.

Related to this are the line breaks. Pump.io supports long posts, with embedded images, tables, lists... etc. Well, you know, HTML content, as I said.

It would be great that at least line breaks get correctly converted to <br> tags ;)

- Accounts: the same menu that TL but showing the accounts and a ""combined"" selector. The icon is the default account icon.
- Go to the top button
- Another button:  to be honest, I don't know what button should be there but I think it's more attractive with 5 buttons. Anyway, 4 buttons works cool as well.

Suggestion: Keeping track of when I ""fav'd"" (or retweeted) the message doesn't necessarily be showed as extra information, it can be inferred by the timestamp from the TL. I Would suggest coloured signifiers for the Reply, Retweet & Favorite icons at the bottom of the message (similar to how twitter shows it).

You'll free up screenspace at the top (a) and right bottom (b) per message too.

In general as I understand it AndStatus now throws each action back into the ""Everything Timeline"" which is a bit redundant in my opinion. So if I fav'd & retweeted a message it will show up with a total of 3 times the original message (original message, bulletbites fav'd message & bulletbites retweeted message). To free up the TL simply icons could highlight your actions without the need to show me again the stuff I fav'd & retweeted in the timeline.

We need to create our local conversation id and link all related messages by this ID right during message storage to database. This will increase saving time a bit (this is done in a background), but greatly improve Conversation View opening.

andstatus/andstatus,open,Blank space above and below some attachments,"[Label(name=""UX issue"")]","As I described in #342 Images, which are loaded asynchronously, should have on the screen the same predefined height no matter what their actual size is. I.e. they should be shown with exactly the same height as a blank image that was placed initially in a view.

Currently blank image for portrait device orientation has also portrait orientation. This is good when you see images with portrait orientation and this produces large blank space for landscape images, as you see.
Current successful fix of the image height in a list proved that approach with blank image works. Blank image is used only in a case when requested image is not loaded (from SD) into an in-memory cache. This is why on a second scroll over the same images you see them without any unnecessary blank space: images are loaded from cache synchronously.

I see that proper solution is to find out actual image dimensions beforehand, just after the image was downloaded from the Internet. So we could reserve correct space for each image.

It would be better if Andstatus would change this somehow. To get back to TL ""everything"" from ""mentions"" there should be a proper back-option to jump you back instantly to your preset TL choice, something like a ""home"" button.

Also I don't get why the ""combined"" option is in that menu. Why not move it away to ""settings"".

I am looking for some suitable android pump.io client. I like andstatus because it allows me to write offline and then post it later when I got Wifi connection. This is quite important for me, because I don't want to be connected all the time.

I tried all out, but could't figure out how this can be done with andstatus. Seems it is not supported yet, and I am buffled, that no one misses this :-)

Maybe you can add this feature if it really is not supported if you got some time for it.

andstatus/andstatus,open,"Add intelligent reply logic for threaded tweets (Including integration of ""Reply to All"")",[],"Currently, when doing replies to someone, it automatically adds the handle of the one I reply to. That's fine for single replies, but for multiple replies, it can get messy.

How it currently works:

```
1 + Original tweet by @ SomeRandomUser
2 |- My reply, which AndStatus automatically starts with @ SomeRandomUser
3 | ` My reply to my reply so I can keep things threaded & organized
4 |   ` @ SomeOtherRandomUser replies to me
5 |     ` My reply to @ SomeOtherRandomUser
6 ` Another of my replies to @ SomeRandomUser
```

I'm suggesting adding logic to detect when that third & fifth lines are occurring, & directing those replies towards the ones involved. Currently, AndStatus' normal ""Reply"" option just fetches the user who made the tweet I'm replying to, so on the third line, AndStatus will use @ MyUserHandle, & the fifth line only has @ SomeOtherRandomUser.

Here's the logic:
1. Get the user of the tweet being replied to.
2. Get all handles mentioned in the body of the tweet being replied to, and add them after the initial user.
3. Filter out any duplicates, removing all but the first instance of each handle. (Mainly done to detect instances when people might use a handle more than once in a reply by typing it in.)
4. Remove the AndStatus user's handle UNLESS there's no other handles left.

Following that logic, the threaded reply on line 3 in my example would get this:
Step 1. @ MyUserHandle
Step 2. @ MyUserHandle @ SomeRandomUser
Step 3. (No change because there's no duplicates)
Step 4. @ SomeRandomUser

On line 5, my reply would look like this (assuming @ SomeOtherRandomUser didn't remove @ SomeRandomUser from their reply body):
Step 1. @ SomeOtherRandomUser
Step 2. @ SomeOtherRandomUser @ MyUserHandle @ SomeRandomUser
Step 3. (No change)
Step 4. @ SomeOtherRandomUser @ SomeRandomUser

For the record, this is how Twitter works. No ""Reply to all"" separation, either, since it's all integrated. If there's a bunch of handles mentioned, the user can delete the ones not relevant using the backspace key before typing. The more relevant people will be put at the beginning of the list with this logic, so it's not as likely they'd need to adjust the cursor to erase people not involved.

As was decided many years ago, when a User opens a timeline,  the timeline opens at the same place it was viewed before. It's not bad by itself, but together with these old messages ALL newer messages are shown. A few hundreds of messages are not a problem, but showing a thousand or even more can freeze the application for a long time. 
We should make the ""view page"" movable, so only closest ""page of messages"" is shown, not all since the time of the last viewed message.

An enhancement to this would be to perhaps show option near each for what privacy setting is desired (if that is an option). Presumably if/when privacy selection is added, a UI would already be needed for the post.
The 'icon' highlight would use the default privacy setting - or perhaps the 'last used' one... though that could get confusing as well.

I thought that being able to have, as an option, manual timeline refresh could give noticeable performance increase for people, who have many new messages in their timelines and frequent updates...

As I see now, local Sqlite (Android native) database is a bottleneck, because at least some of requests to it don't allow concurrent access at all. This is why I'm trying to reduce a total number of requests to a database. 

I plan to implement this as an additional button on a Timeline  (or in an Action bar) with ""New updates are available"" title, which becomes visible only when new or updated messages have been downloaded/saved to local cache.
The button may even show a number of such updates...

The bug is caused by a changed behavior of the Message Editor. Now, as soon as Activity get paused (e.g. when an image selection dialog opens), the Editor is hidden and current draft is being saved in a background. After image selection is made, control returns to the Activity, but there is no open Editor there, and this is why selected image is ignored. 
After Activity's return from a paused state the last draft is being loaded back to the Message Editor automatically, again, in a background, but this is too late: information on selected image is discarded already.

I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing AndStatus with it. I found that the main thread of AndStatus, frequently calls 

Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(...);

after calling the drawableFromCursor function in the AttachedImageDrawable class. As also the Android documentation states, the decode\* functions should not be executed on the UI thread. As a result, moving the execution of the BitmapFactory.decodeFile(...); off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app while the user is scrolling through the timeline activity of AndStatus.

I tried moving the BitmapFactory.decodeFile(...) call off the main thread and the improvements in AndStatus responsiveness are noticeable. 

Do you think that moving the decodeFile call off the main thread would be a valuable solution for improving AndStatus responsiveness?

andstatus/andstatus,open,Why I don't see new posts in a Timeline? AndStatus is not syncing anymore,"[Label(name=""Questions&Answers"")]","We receive many similar questions, and this is why I decided to start this thread to collect all advices on how to check, diagnose and fix this.

Some tips on what to do when your timeline is not synced:
1. Normally AndStatus should download new updates automatically, using Android built-in Syncing feature. So you wouldn't need to press Reload at all. Just open AndStatus and read the latest updates. 
   Maybe you turned that Android sync off? Go to Android system Settings -> Accounts and Sync (or something like this...) and check if sync is turned on for ""AndStatus"" accounts. There you will also see, when last sync was done successfully for each account you added in AndStatus.
   ![screenshot_20160710-073012](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/207716/16711682/7cfd882c-4670-11e6-8659-d9eb7a05fbed.png)
2. Does manual _Reload_ work? Please ""Swipe to refresh"" or press ""Reload"" on an Action bar. If you still don't see new messages, please check ""Commands in a queue"" in the menu.
3. Default period of automatic synchronisation (for all accounts) may be checked and changed in AndStatus Settings -> Syncing -> Sync frequency. See other settings, related to Syncing there also... 
   Each account may have its own syncing frequency, so if the Default syncing frequency is OK, you may go to AndStatus settings -> Manage Accounts -> select an account
4. If you don't see new posts of some account (in a timeline of that account) go to AndStatus Settings -> Manage existing accounts -> select that account from a list. Account settings window will be opened. The window shows you: \* if automatic sync is enabled, \* when last sync occurred and \* if the account has it's custom sync frequency set. Press ""Reverify credentials"" button to check and fix authentication-related problems. See this related issue #242.
   ![screenshot_20160710-074340](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/207716/16711702/2ce8c70a-4672-11e6-9daa-5a947923d9bf.png)
5. Messages  that you posted, but which appeared not sent,  may be found in ""Outbox"" and ""Drafts"" timelines. You can resend them! If after re-sending and syncing a message is still marked as ""(unsent)"", go to ""Commands in a Queue"" and find out error report on that exact message. That error report on one message can be Shared e.g. to email or to AndStatus itself in order to receive help from your peers... 
6. Since v.27 ""Manage timelines"" table is a great help in syncing problems investigation. It shows information about syncing, including: number of successful syncs and time of the last successful sync; number of failed syncs and time and an error message of the last failure, for _each_ timeline. See the example page below.

7. Missed syncing in the background may be caused by the Android Doze and Standby modes. Read e.g. here tip on how to tweak this: https://www.howtogeek.com/242563/how-androids-doze-improves-your-battery-life-and-how-to-tweak-it/"

andstatus/andstatus,closed,Unsent messages and attachments,"[Label(name=""New feature"")]","Contemplating on how to implement caching of images before sending them ( see #273 ) and Image preview for the Message Editor ( see #290 ), I see that we really need to have unsent messages and their unsent attachments stored in a database the same way downloaded messages and attachments are stored. 
This will allow us to see unsent messages in a Timeline and in a Conversation view. We discussed this last year in #149 and that time showing unsent images was implemented in a ""Commands in a queue"" view only. That view is very convenient for dealing with communication errors, but doesn't allow to see attachments and also doesn't allow to see unsent messages in a conversation context.
It would be good to implement a solution, which would allow us to implement in the future ""Drafts"" easily (we discussed drafts in #153). Actually, Draft message is almost the same as ""Unsent message"" with the difference that Draft may be edited and it is not queued for sending yet.

Looking at the latest repository build I see these points of improvement:
1. Text of a message should be visually closer to a Username above it. This may mean to figure out, how to fit ""Favorited"" star (or maybe change its shape?!)
2. Divider between messages is easily visible in a Conversation view, but almost invisible in a Timeline.

Recent ticket #274  made me understand that AndStatus takes from Pump.io timeline not only ""items"" of the Timeline, but also ""notes"", which these items are Replies to (they are embedded into the Replies - items of a Timeline)

Correct behavior would be to download such related messages (optionally!) , but mark them explicitly as ""not subscribed"" during parsing. So such messages will not appear in the Home Timeline, but will be present in Everything Timeline and in a Conversation view.

Typically I notice this because the author of the original note responds to the other responses, so I notice that I'm only seeing part of the conversation.

As an example, [this post](https://identi.ca/liw/note/ca9Za6vmSUWViWjYGdk6HQ) and all of liw's replies show up in my timeline and the conversation view of the original post.  However, I had to `Open on internet` to see Claes' response.

andstatus/andstatus,open,Retweet/Reblog with comment,"[Label(name=""New feature"")]","There was a discussion at Quitter.se on this: https://quitter.se/notice/3715247
which left me with a feeling that talking about the same subject different participants kept different usage scenarios / different things in mind.
Before anything can be done, we need to clarify meaning and implementation as it is visible to the User.

Here are points, which need to be thought of together:
1. Currently ""Reblog with comment"" may be done in two steps: ""Reblog"" + ""Reply"". This is how usually Social networks work. Technically ""Retweet /Reblog"" API (communication protocol) doesn't allow addition of comments. So do we really need to automate this two-step process?
2.  On the other hand, recently Twitter added separate ""Retweet with comment"" feature: http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/06/retweetception/ . Is this actually a combination of the above two steps or is this a new operation? 
3. Anyway, GNU Social doesn't support this as a ""single action"" meaning that these will be _two_ separate things in e.g. GNU Social Web interface: Reblog and Reply.
4. Or what we really need is a ""Reply with Quote""? @mcscx seems like shows us an example of a ""Reblog with comment"" in this thread. But when he writes: 

```
@helioloureiro you could do ""Share"" > ""Andstatus"", then modify the original post 
RD @helioloureiro no such operation here
```

the text after ""RD @helioloureiro"" (""no such operation here"", which should presumably mean ""Reblog of the below post by @helioloureiro"") is _not_ a complete copy of the original post: 

```
@mcscx no such operation here :( https://quitter.se/attachment/950194
```

So the above example is really a _Quote_ (of some part of the original post), not a ""repeat"".
5. And finally, a question to the author of the first message in this discussion: It's interesting that having an account at the site with 140 characters limit you are asking for the feature. I don't see much practical use of this as usually there is almost no space left for the ""comment"". Moreover, ""Reblog with comment of Reblog with comment"" will certainly be impossible with low character limits...

By removing and putting the widget back, it displays ""no data yet."" forever. Even when opening the app and refreshing the timeline, the widget seems ignoring the update.

Only have a twitter account configured.

Keep up the good work!

In Twitter a Group is called a ""List"". From https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460 :

> A list is a curated group of Twitter users. You can create your own lists or subscribe to lists created by others. Viewing a list timeline will show you a stream of Tweets from only the users on that list.

These days have been crazy on GNU social because of the censorship of Twitter over a several accounts, one of these actions was disabling a Twitstar account and then, she moved on to Quitter.se. A lot of her followers are now on Quitter.se and it produced ""Quitter"" as a trending topic on Twitter so a lot of more users have arrived on GNU social and we are telling them to use Andstatus, Mustard and MustardMod as clients. So quitter.se collapsed and now there are 5 ""quitter"" instances: quitter.se, quitter.no, quitter.is, quitter.zone and quitter.es (and more are coming).
People thinks that gnusocial = quitter and it's not, so when they'll come here and try to add their ""Quitter"" account they won't be able to do that because of the configuration of ""Quitter"" as an instance on Andstatus.

**MY SOLUTION**  
I porpoise to restructure the options and use 3 instead of 5:
- GNU social
- Pump
- Twitter

And inside ""GNU social"" add the most popular instances: these last ones and the recommended servers by the GNU social proyect (gnu.io/social/try) already configured (like quitter, loadaverage and vinilox are now). So it would be something like:

Settings / Add new account / GNU social / quitter.is, quitter.no, quitter.is, quitter.se, quitter.zone, quitter.es, vinilox, loadaverage, gnusocial.de and gnusocial.no.

andstatus/andstatus,closed,"[pump.io] Don't make a Reply (""Comment"") public",[],"First of all, thanks for your work on AndStatus. It's great :)

In pump.io, it makes sense to specify the recipients of an original post, like a note, or an image.
That can be addressed (via the ""To"" field) to individuals, lists, or public.

What doesn't work correctly is specifying the ""to"" field when sending a reply to a note. It should not be specified, and let the server fill that in as needed, according to the note's recipients.

As it is now, what happens is:
- UserA creates a post, with whatever client, sent to UserB (so UserB receives a notice about it) and to Public.
- RandomUser123 replies with AndStatus, so the reply is sent only to ""public.
- UserB is not notified about RandomUser123's reply, because AndStatus specifically said ""to: public"".

What should happen is:
*RandomUser123 replies, and the reply is sent to the same recipients as the original note, and the original author. Or whatever the server thinks is appropriate.
- UserB is notified about RandomUser123's reply, since the original post was addressed to him/her.

A: Timeline in ""Combined"" mode shows messages from all accounts (all Microblogging systems) as one list. It's like a ""timeline aggregator"".

andstatus/andstatus,open,"Treat different ""GNU social"" systems as one ""GNU social"" federation","[Label(name=""New feature"")]","Currently AndStatus treats different microblogging systems of StatusNet type as totally unrelated.

However,  there is a way to easily find duplicate dents: they have the same globally unique identifier in the ""uri"" field of JSON object (for a user: ""statusnet_profile_url"")

The questions are: 
Q1. Which of duplicated dents should be kept? Which of duplicated Users should be kept?
Q2. How do we link together dents from different systems, if they are really parts of the same conversation?

Possible solution:
1. We create another, virtual Microblogging system, called ""GNUsocial"", meaning the global ""federation"". In  ""GNUsocial"" both messages and users have GUIDs, described above.
2. We store common part of dents and users as belonging to the ""GNUsocial""  + create additional tables to store ""local ids"" of dents and users in all systems - members of the federation, from which we are receiving the same dent/user.

In general, when posting a reply, specifying the To or CC fields **should not be necessary**. Then the server will use the parent post's values and do what's best.

I can explain this further if necessary.

I am analyzing andstatus using a static code checker. I found some potential slow operations in andstatus's UI thread.

Android documentation says this: 
http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-anr.html

""Any method that runs in the UI thread should do as little work as possible on that thread. In particular, activities should do as little as possible in key life-cycle methods such as onCreate(). Potentially long running operations such as network or database operations should be done in a worker thread (e.g., via AsyncTask).""

I found the some event handlers transitively performing heavy operations, here is a representative one:

org.andstatus.app.origin.OriginEditor.onCreate() which calles DB queries

The call hierarchy is shown below:
org.andstatus.app.origin.Origin.hasChildren()Z
org.andstatus.app.origin.OriginEditor.processNewIntent(Landroid/content/Intent;)V
org.andstatus.app.origin.OriginEditor.onCreate(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V

So a natural use case for using the ""Public timeline"" may be this:
1. User selects ""Public"" as a type of a timeline
2. The system shows messages from local cache or empty if e.g. target Microblogging system doesn't have Public timeline.
3. User initiates Search as usual, typing word(s) of the query.
4. The system shows the same cache filtered by the query.
5. ""Options"" menu now has ""Global search"" item to request the same query from Microblogging system (or from all Microblogging systems in a case ""Combined"" timeline shown).
6. System updates local cache with received search results and shows this updated ""Public timeline"" to the User.

3b. ""Reload"" of the ""Public timeline""  retrieves latest messages from the timeline, if this is supported by the Microblogging system.

""Syncronize Public timeline"" option may be added to the parameters of the Account (so AndStatus will use credentials of this user to retrieve Public timeline AND for Global Search).

From the first glance at the Pocket documentation it shouldn't be a big deal.

I was actually thrilled by the Pocket ( http://getpocket.com/developer/docs/getstarted/android ) ability to save pages for offline reading.
Currently AndStatus User may ""Share"" a message (tweet) from AndStatus as: ""Add to Pocket"" - and voila: the page is queued for offline reading.
What I'm thinking here about is to integrate with the Pocket deeper, so that clicking on a link in a message would open the Pocket offline page in case the user is offline or in bad communication conditions...
As I see it now, AndStatus may ask Pocket to save ALL pages, linked to the Favorited messages. So a User will automatically have linked content of all Favorited messages ready for the Offline reading.
