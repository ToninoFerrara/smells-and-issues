stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Issue #488. Appwidget colours are not consistent in dark theme'd layout,[],Fixes #501.
stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Is it really needed to reload the notes when leaving the about and settings menu?,[],"Just wondering is it really to check for updated notes, after visiting the menu options: about and settings.

When visiting about, nothing is changed in that menu, is that require a update from the server anyway?

Similar for the settings menu, especially when no changes are made at all.  Perhaps some of the settings require a update, perhaps that can be memorized by app, and only contact the server when leaving the settings menu and the need to contact the server has been set.

(I think that the app should avoid to contact the server as much as possible, especially when connected mobile 3G/4G)"

`this.account.setText(username + ""@"" + url.substring(0, url.length() - 1));`

""url"" is set to """" as per:
 `String url = preferences.getString(SettingsActivity.SETTINGS_URL, SettingsActivity.DEFAULT_SETTINGS).replace(""https://"", """").replace(""http://"", """");`

So url.substring() causes the crash, as best as I can see. The strange thing is that I was replaying the crash and around 1 in 10 attempts the first run screen would be displayed waiting for server information as expected.

Phone is running 7.1.2 (Lineage 14.1) and has run the notes app fine up until now. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling from f-droid with the same result.

Neither does reinstalling the app or cleaning the cache.

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Favorites in main notes list,"[Label(name=""Discussion""), Label(name=""UX"")]","@dan0xii suggested to sort the notes list by favorite attribute (again). Since this issue is hidden in the discussion of another PR (#275), I'm making it more visible with this separate issue.

## Variants to decide
There are two possibilities of sorting the notes in the app's main activity:

1. First by favorite (favorites first), then by date (recent notes first)
2. Only by date, separate menu item for favorites

## Situation
We had the first variant in the Android app until the navigation drawer was introduced. Now, we have a separate menu item for favorites.

The web app uses the first variant, too. But this may change when introducing categories to the web app - currently, it lacks of separate/filtered notes lists.

The Nextcloud files app doesn't sort by favorite, there we have a separate menu item like in this app now.

## Evaluation
The idea of the favorite feature is to be able to fast find often used notes. This is more effective, if the main list view is sorted by favorites. However, recently modified notes move down in that view and it obsoletes a separate favorites list.

Did I missed something?

## Remarks
This discussion is only about the notes list activity. The notes list widget should be discussed separately (I think that favorites should be first in the widget).

it would be amazing if you gave the opportunity to chose an own default file name extension (like .md for Markdown) in the settings. 
That way I wouldn't need to rename my notes for editors like QOwnNotes or vim to work properly. 

Best regards and thanks for the great app!"
stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Confirm before deletion,"[Label(name=""Discussion""), Label(name=""UX"")]","A user just called me and was very frustrated because she accentually swiped left and removed a note containing ALL here passwords. The strange thing is that it didn't end up in the trashbin so I couldn't even restore it. Luckily I had a backup and we could revert the note from there, but still, I think it's WAY to easy to delete a note, as you don't even get a confirmation.

So, I suggest that you should add a confirmation when removing a note. Something like a popup asking ""Are you sure?"" or similar.

Please add this, it's important that notes don't get accentually deleted. Thank you!

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,"Screen off events delete current note, even if previously saved","[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Issue:  When creating or viewing a note (previously fully saved!), if the screen turns off, the note will be completely erased.   If you're using this for a shopping list, and your attention lapses, you'll lose your list.  This happens whether the note is in initial edit mode (though it claims saving during editing) or if you open an existing note that was previously saved.  Erased notes can be restored from the Nextcloud versioning system, so this is a positive overwrite event by Nextcloud Notes.

I really like this application, particularly for simplicity compare to other notes app, but right now i'm writing date on every notes at the begining, i like them ordering by name with the date at the beginning.

I'd like to known if it's interresting for someone else than me, to get something like one more bouton on the top right that add a date on the text field, or even better an option on parameters to auto-add date at the new notes names.

I've never try to do any android app for now, so i'm not sure to be able to pull an even simple requests like this for now. Maybe sometimes.

Thanks."
stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Drawer menu implementation,[],"This PR is a new take (compared to #198) on implementing the drawer menu (basically what I implemented on the Nextcloud client and Nextcloud SMS client itself). 
Due to my IDE setup this PR will also update the build tools used, the gradle wrapper and the Android gradle plugin version too. So this PR needs Android Studio 3.0.1 to work. If this is a problem than I can revert back the files that lead to this (their are not necessary for this PR but have been auto-updated by Android Studio 3.0.1).

This PR adds a Drawer Implementation to the main view of the app adding 
* 3 menu items via a menu configuration file
* adding an abstract  DrawerActivity which takes care of the drawer handling (screen rotation state preservation, menu icon tinting, etc.)
* it doesn't add a ""favorites"" item since I haven't seen this functionality yet but that would be easy to do - once the functions is available one just needs to add another menu items + action.

Here are 2 screenshot of how it looks on Android 8 (and since it is implemented with the standard appCompat classes it also looks like this on older Android versions :)

This appears to still be an issue (notes app 0.12.1 installed via F-Droud, LineageOS 14.1 [Android 7.1]).  Enabling the http2 option in nginx implicitly disables pre-1.2 TLS (which is a good idea anyway, as these versions have known vulnerabilities) and prevents the notes app from synchronising.  Disabling http2 allows the notes app to work again.  

The NextCloud app, all web browsers that I've tried, DAVDroid, and iOS and macOS calendar and contact sync all all work correctly with http2 enabled (and several of them work noticeably faster), so it's a shame that I have to disable it for the notes app to work."

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Note content disappears on screen rotate.,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Hi,

As I mentioned in the title when I open a note when the phone is in portrait mode and rotate the phone to landscape the content disappears. The notes app is set to open the note in view mode by default, but I think it also happens in edit mode too, because I lost the content of a note and I think it was cased by this issue.

It's easy to reproduce:
  - put the phone in portrait mode
  - open a note
  - rotate the phone in landscape mode

As a simple fix, for me, it's enough to simply force the orientation to portrait by adding:
`android:screenOrientation=""portrait""`

Thanks,

I installed the app on both our phones and we use the same nextcloud account to login. I think it's a great feature, that does not seem to be documented anywhere. It should be listed as a feature on the f-droid store in my opinion. I have been looking for a shared shopping list (with my own server as backend) for some time since the app I have been using so far (shoppinglist from frdroid) is no longer maintained and does not support multiple lists. I just happened to stumble upon this app by accident on f-droid and thought it might work as a shared list because of the nextcloud back-end. And it works! 
If it is not an intended feature, my question would be if the use by multiple users could lead to corrupt files or errors if the list is edited and maybe saved at the same time? "

We can make it even clickable: when clicking on the title/subtitle (i.e., the note's name or note's category), the CategoryDialogFragment will be opened. This provides an easier access to changing the category than using the menu item ""category"", since on the most devices it is ""hidden"" behind the three-dots button.

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Open in read-mode by default,[],"When a new entry is opened, the keyboard is shown and the cursor blinks at the first line; all is fine.

When an existing entry is opened it shows the same behaviour, which doesn't seem logical from a users perspective. The notes have just as much purpose for being read as they have for being edited. Also, the chance that one has to start typing at the beginning of the first line within an existing note  is very small.

It might be more efficient to hide the keyboard by default for existing entries and open the text in read-mode, until the cursor is placed in between the text somewhere by hand.

Consider the following scenario's

**I want to read an existing entry**
_Current behaviour_
I open the entry I want to read from the overview and it opens with the keyboard in sight, blocking half the screen. I have to tick the android back-button to get rid of the keyboard so I can start reading.

_Proposed behaviour (read-only)_
I open the entry I want to read from the overview and it opens the full text. I can immediately start reading and scroll through the text where needed.

**I want to edit an existing entry**
_Current behaviour_
I open the entry I want to edit from the overview and it opens with the keyboard in sight and I want to start editing where I stopped last time.

I have to either scroll through the text with the keyboard in sight (less overview) of I first hide the keyboard so I have more overview of my text (more actions).

_Proposed behaviour (read-only)_
I open the entry I want to edit from the overview, it opens in read-only mode. I want to edit where I stopped last time.
I scroll down to the place where I want to start typing and tap the screen in order to point the cursor there and open the keyboard (edit-mode)

I have read [this issue](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes/issues/189), but I want to insist and ask the developer to reconsider the matter, not because line breaks that make the notes look more or less pleasant, but for a very simple reason: seems that mature people have difficulties to read, but especially to edit their notes. I've verified with two persons I have ""evangelized"" to abandon Google and come to the ""free world"".
They don't have any visual defficiency beyond what's normal in the sixties and seventies: presbyopia, something that practically all of us shall suffer when we turn 40 - 45 y. o. and beyond. While their mobiles'  UI font size seems sufficient to read most of the apps, it turns out that NC Notes app's summary view uses a much smaller font. But the major problem comes when editing the notes: the font size makes difficult to handle the cursor, make selections, to copy/paste, etc, even with their glasses.
I must add thay while I have no problems to see the text clearly, I'd thank if I could set the interface font size bigger because the size of my fingers. Not that they are enormous, I think are normal for a near to 1,90 m man, but sometimes it's hard to place the cursor where I want; it hapens also when typing an email or chatting, but in those kind of applications I don't use text format nor edit what I type so often, so I don't care much. But it's different in an editor like this notes editor.

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,WYSIWYG mode,[],"I think an ""all-user"" notes app should have a WYSIWYG interface. Not as the unique option, but as an option at least. I think that if FLOSS people wants to normalize FLOSS apps and services these should be as easy to use as proprietary commercial apps, if not, common users (my aunt, yours, our doctors who barely can use their Iphones, our pharmacist friend who doesn't even know how to write in bolds in Whatsapp...) shall keep thinking that FLOSS is a complicated and geeky thing, so better stick to Evernote even if learning how to use  ""*"", ""#"", ""==="", media attachment tags and not much more isn't that difficult, but you know, everything that looks like ""coding""... Panic!

Saying this I'm not meaning that NC Notes app should become an HTML editor, on the contrary, I like Markdown's simplicity and easyness to edit when you learn very few and easy rules, but a WYSIWYG interface isn't incompatible and would make a lot of people's life easier. Most of the tools the majority of users would ever need would fit in a simple toolbar with a few buttons, It could even be some floating pop up toolbar, like those in [this plugin for MediumEditor](http://linkesch.com/medium-editor-insert-plugin/) (double clic on a word or single click on the image or video to see the toolbar appear) or in http://telegra.ph, https://sofish.github.io/pen/ and many other online Markdown editors that offer the user a ""werid signs"" free WYSIWYG interface with no clutter, and very ""every-kind-of-user"" friendly.
Of course the users should be able to switch between WYSIWYG and code interfaces, and set whatever they wanted as the default one. Plain text MD edition still is the quickest way to edit for experienced users.

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Edit/Preview Activity enhancements,"[Label(name=""Enhancement"")]","Thanks a lot to @schaarsc for #242 !

I have some further ideas for enhancement:

- [x] The ActionBar buttons and menu entries should be consistent for edit mode and for preview mode. Currently, there is a ""Category"" button in edit mode, but none in preview mode. **(high priority)**
- [ ] I suggest a new view mode ""source code"", which contains a native `EditText` without Markdown functionality. This could be useful, if there are problems with `RxMDEditText` or if someone wants to edit text only. **(low priority)**

Edit: Here are some more issues:
- [x] `NoteEditFragment.getNote()` saves implicitely the notes and triggers synchronization. This is kind of bad hack: E.g., when opening a note in edit mode, `saveData()` is called twice (without a need at all), when triggering the favorite action in edit mode, `saveData()` is also called twice (triggering once at the end is sufficient). This should be optimized. **(high priority)**
- [x] The label of the *edit* button is wrong. A good solution would be to add both (edit and preview) buttons to the XML file and then toggle visibility instead of modifying them. **(high priority)**
- [x] I suggest to change the order of the buttons/menu and put the preview/edit button at first position. In my point of view, this is the most important button which should be shown even on devices which are so small that only one button can be shown. **(medium priority)**
- [x] It's good that the mode strings in `EditNoteActivity` (e.g. `edit`, `preview`, ...) were moved to constants. However, there are still two sources of these strings: `arrays.xml` and `EditNoteActivity`. This should be consolidated into one source. E.g., add constant strings to `arrays.xml` (e.g. `<string name=""note_mode_preview"">preview</string>`) and reference those from `string-array` (e.g. `<item>@string/note_mode_preview</item>`) and from `EditNoteActivity` (`getString(R.string.note_mode_preview)`). Another option would be to use class constants and then fill the preference activity manually from these constants. **(low priority)**
- [x] We should do this also for all preference keys, such as `PREF_NOTE_MODE` (but also for the other preferences). But that can be done later. **(low priority)**

For clarification all spaces will be represented as `_` !

Note Editing has two modes:
 1) _edit mode_ where I can modify the content with the Software keyboard provided by Android. Markdown markups applied here do format the text on-the-fly (e.g. when starting a line with `##_` the fontsize is increased and font is bolt)
 2) _view_mode_ can be entered by clicking the eye on top-right, here we can see a _rendered_ preview of the note (I will also outline spaces in _view mode_, maybe these are in fact margins or whatever)

**Problem description**
on-the-fly formating of lists in _edit mode_ is kind of broken, some examples

 1) in _edit mode_ entering `*_item1` on a new line does not trigger any reformatting
but in _view mode_ this is shown as `_•_item1`

 2) in _edit mode_ entering `_*_item2` on a new line does not trigger any reformatting
but in _view mode_ this is shown as `__•_item2`

 3) in _edit mode_ entering `*_item1` and THEN inserting a space in front of the `*` triggers a reformatting to `_•_*_item1`
but in _view mode_ this is shown the same way as before: as `__•_item2`

4) in _edit mode_ entering `_*_item4` and THEN putting the cursor in front of the `*` and click BACKSPACE triggers a reformatting to `_•_*_item4`
in _view mode_ this is shown as `_•_item4`

 5) when the on-the-fly rendering of a list-item has worked (there is a • in front of it), it is possible to add a new item by hitting RETURN at the end of any item, but this only works if the Android keyboard did not autocorrect the last entered word

It seems the on-the-fly formatting of lists in the editor is totally broken, the _view mode_ seems to do the right thing.
It is not possible to ""initialise"" a list without setting the cursor in front of the `*` and insert a space."

- After someone uses one of the special characters the first time, the user is asked to choose if he wants to ignore those characters or not. Also he should ge a hint to the configuration menu.

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,Quickwin for category label,"[Label(name=""Discussion""), Label(name=""UX"")]","The current category label does not perform well.
Until the sidebar is implemented, it would be a quickwin to display them a bit more beautiful.

I made two changes to compare.

The first one is just a bit grey background and some more padding, might be better when many notes are in category because it does not distract that much from the more important content.

Ah, and no, there won't be an option for that 😆

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,API Compatibility Issues,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.widget.RemoteViews: void setRemoteAdapter(int,android.content.Intent)>:[14,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

NONE

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the project’s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report.

Maybe we have to use `&lt;` instead of `<` for HTML tags inside of a string, but that's only a hypothesis.
- [x] Constant parts of strings (e.g. URLs) should be moved into separate (untranslatable) string. This will simplify changes in these parts (i.e. in `about_source`, `about_issues`, `about_app_icon_disclaimer`, `about_icons_disclaimer`, maybe also the license name in `about_app_license`).
- [x] Some of these URLs point to an outdated location, so a change is definitely required (`about_source`, `about_issues`).
- [x] I propose to merge the two sections about icon into one (`about_app_icon_disclaimer`, `about_icons_disclaimer`). Strings can be concatenated.
- [x] The list of translators (`about_translators`) is obsolete. I propose to change the string to `Nextcloud community on Transifex`.
- [x] Plurals are currently in a separate file (`plurals.xml`). However, there is no need for this and it causes that there are two separate resources in Transifex, which bloats the project. I propose to integrate plurals into `strings.xml`.
- ~~There is an XML schema in order to provide more information about untranslatable parts of a string (especially placeholders) which can be helpful for translators (see [docs](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/localization-checklist.html)), e.g. `<xliff:g id=""app_version"" example=""v2.1.0"">%1$s</xliff:g>`.

Android app shows combined list types identical as in the Nextcloud web UI.
At the same time there seems to be no support for nested numbered list levels but this might be a feature request for the Nextcloud app and not for this android app.

Combined list types (numbered and bullet-ed list types) are numbered according to first list type.
So if the list items start with a * all subsequent rows automatically use this list item.

1. Create a note with the attached markup

1. Modify an existing note using the web interface (e.g. add or remove a line)
2. Start the app and immediately start to edit the same note (before synchronization has been finished)
3. Close the note on the app (using the ""back"" button)

Result: the changes made to the note using the web interface are lost and overwritten with the local changes (or the old version, if no local changes have been made).

I propose the following solution: the app should deny editing a note before synchronization has been finished! I. e. if I tap the ""edit"" button and the note has not yet been synchronized, instead of opening the editor with the outdated content, synchronization should be started and the editor should only be opened after the note has been synchronized. In order to indicate activity to the user, the same animation can be shown that is already used when triggering a manual synchronization (by swiping down). In case synchronization is not possible (e. g. no connection), a warning should be shown that makes it clear that all unsynchronized changes made through the web interface will be lost when the note is edited locally.

In trying to reproduce this, it appears that once a note on OwnCloud-Notes has been created, if the first line is changed, the note no longer syncs.   All other changes sync really well."
stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,New feature: set a note as favorite (star/unstar),[],"Setting a note as favorite was already introduced on the server side (owncloud/notes#248 and nextcloud/notes#4) and can be used to stick important notes to the top of the list in order to find them easier (cp. #92). My changes here introduce this feature for the android app.

Beside this, I did some necessary refactoring in the `NotesListViewActivity`/`ItemAdapter`: (re-)loading the list of notes is now done in an `AsyncTask` and reuses the `ItemAdapter` instance (instead of creating a new instance on every refresh). As a result, the list of notes does not jump to the top anymore (cp. #118).

The implementation of the favorite feature is straight forward and has no special treatment for old(*) server app versions (i.e., versions that do not support the favorite feature). As a result, if a user sets a note as favorite, the star disappears after the next synchronization with an old server app. This behavior can be improved with some effort:

a) activate the feature only on demand => add a checkbox to the settings activity and only show the favorite feature, if this checkbox is activated

b) detect server features automatically => like a), but instead of setting the checkbox by the user, the app has to check if the server uses an appropriate version. This requires changes in the server API (e.g. an `info` URL which returns a JSON with the version number) and its unclear, at which point of time the app should check this in order to detect updates of the server app.

c) activate the feature, but keep the local state if the server result does not contain any information about favorites => requires some changes in the app; problem: when the user updates the server app he/she will lose the local favorites setting (the server favorites will overwrite the local favorites). In order to improve this, some more effort is needed, e.g. a new DB column is required, which notices if the local meta data (i.e. favorite setting) was changed and not yet synchronized. Therefore, this solution requires the most effort (I didn't see this in my first estimation: https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/OwnCloud-Notes/issues/92#issuecomment-256010808).

As an overall consequence, I would leave this as is -- for now. If a better downward compatibility is required, then we can do this in a separate commit/pull request.

(*) today, ""old server app"" means also the current official version of the server app. For now, the favorite feature is only in the git `master` branch and is waiting for the next release.

This is interesting, because the auto-save feature directly sends all changes to the server. Therefore, the old state has to be stored in memory, and saved again if desired. This action can be triggered using the menu. It is not shown directly in the action bar, because I think it is not often needed. But we can change this very easy.

If the old state is restored, the server would nevertheless increase the `modified` time of the note by default. Therefore, I'm working on a patch for the server (see nextcloud/notes#4), which allows to set the `modified` time by the client. Although, this patch is not yet merged (and of course not in a release version), this pull request for the client can be merged already: The changes are fully backward compatible (except for the fact, that restoring an old state will increase the `modified` time on old servers, but I think we can deal with it)!

If there are any notes on the user's device and the user wants to change the URL or username in the settings, ask whether to
1. copy notes to new account, or to
2. purge existing notes (warn if there are unsynchronized changes).

Both cases are reasonable, since a user may want to migrate to a new account and keep the data (1.), migrated the data already (2.) or wants to use another new/existing account (2.). However, the current behavior could be unexpected (unsynchronized notes are copied and the others are purged).

The implementation is easy: for 1., the status for all notes have to be set to `LOCAL_EDITED`, for 2., the database has to be cleared (warn if there are any notes with `status=LOCAL_EDITED`). More difficult is the UI for this. I would display a radio button or switch on the settings activity, above of the submit button. Where and when to display the warning?

#### Finished Tasks
- [x] **Database:** new column `REMOTE_ID` (fixes conflicts between parallel creation of different notes locally and remotely)
- [x] **DBStatus:** `LOCAL_CREATED` is not used anymore (distinction if Note is new or edited can be made with checking `REMOTE_ID=0`; fixes conflicts on synchronization and parallel local edits)
- [x] **Note:** model is split in to `DBNote` (representing the local DB entry of a note) and `OwnCloudNote` (representing the remote note, used by `NotesClient`).
- [x] **ItemAdapter/note item layout:** show icon for unsynchronized changes (simplifies debugging, includes all changes done in #121, closes #119)
- [x] **NoteSQLiteOpenHelper:** database upgrade (add the new column and adapts the data without flushing the database)
- [x] **NoteSQLiteOpenHelper:** add more constraints for database updates (fixes lost updates due to parallel changes of notes (from synchronization and user interface))
- [x] **NoteSQLiteOpenHelper:** `updateNoteAndSync()`: only make database changes, if the content really changed (fixes #104, at least the original intention of the author).
- [x] **NoteSQLiteOpenHelper:** remove recurrent code (improves code quality)
- [x] **NoteServerSyncHelper:** only update if network is connected (fixes lots of thrown exceptions)
- [x] **NoteServerSyncHelper:** schedule synchronization requests (if synchronization is active or network not connected; fixes missing push of _all_ outstanding changes)
- [x] **NoteServerSyncHelper:** restructure the communication between synchronization task and user interface.
- [x] **NoteServerSyncHelper:** consolidate synchronization AsyncTasks into a single one (improves code quality)
- [x] **EditNoteActivity:** ensures, that auto-save is not called, if the previous auto-save is still running. In addition, start next auto-save not before a small delay has passed. (This could fix #76)
#### Other Issues I've Found (not covered by this pull request)
- There is no conflict resolution for the case that a Note is locally and remotely edited in parallel (e.g. during a longer time without network connection). Currently, local changes overwrite remote changed. We have to discuss what would be the desired behavior. See also #66.
- The `ItemAdapter` should use a `CursorAdapter` which is updated automatically if the backend data is changed.
- In order to save traffic during synchronization, `pullRemoteChanges()` could use the `exclude` parameter of the [Notes API](https://github.com/owncloud/notes/wiki/Notes-0.2) in a first step to check which notes changed without downloading unchanged notes. Only in the second step, the whole note content would be downloaded from the changed note. This could save traffic, however, it has to be investigated if the effort worth it (what is the typical/topmost number and size of notes?).

- If I connect to a server on which the ownCloud Notes app is not activated or even available (i.e. ownCloud 7)
- If I change or create a new note, there is no clue, if this note is synchronized successfully or not

Therefore, I suggest to show meaningful error messages if
- the login fails,
- synchronization is not successful

AND introduce a small icon at the right margin of each note in the ListView (main activity) which is shown if the corresponding note was not synchronized yet (e.g. since it is new or was changed).

Why not:
- Have an explicit save mechanism (e.g., an icon, menu option) so the user can choose when to save.
- Save automatically on leaving the note (going back to notes list, dismissing application)
- Save automatically after a period of inactivity. Let us say, if the user has not typed anything in the last _x_ seconds.

But it lacks something: Synchronization. Currently, the app seems to synchronize with the server in irregular intervals. If I edit a note on the server with another app (e.g. OwnCloud's web interface), the notes app does not notice. Closing and reopening the app a couple of times seems to eventually make it synchronize and show the new version.

Worse yet, if I edit a note that has been edited elsewhere, the app overwrites any changes and crashes afterwards, both of which obviously shouldn't happen.

My proposal:
- Investigate the crash bug ;)
- Show a refresh button in the app's main view that animates when a sync is in progress
- Sync automatically whenever the app or a note is opened

stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes,closed,wrong url error -> crash,[],"Hi, i tryed to build your app in Android Studio.
Maybe i did something wrong:

I opened it in Android Studio, and had simply built it with a self created Key.
Than i simply installed it in Android 5.1.1 and tryed to connect to my ownCloud 8.2.0.

In the first try, there will happen nothing if i click on _ok_.
Than, i re-open the App, the _ok_-Button is still dead, but the _enter_-Button on the Keyboard works.
There come a Toast-Notify with _invalid Url_ (no sure if its called so in english) and the App crashes.
I had tryed the base Url of my instance and the one, called in the Api documentation also.

The base Url is working fine in MyOwnNotes.
...maybe you want to host us an .apk File?
Not anyone interested on your app, have the experience or pleasure to figure out how this works... :-)

This PR will fix #30 and migrate from `ListView`s to `RecyclerView`s, allowing more flexibility. For now, I simply replaced the `ListView` in one activity (`NotesListViewActivity`). To do:
- [x] Fix note creation callback
- [x] Replace `ListView` by `RecyclerView` in `NotesListViewActivity`
- [ ] Replace `ListView` by `RecyclerView` in `SelectSingleNoteActivity`
- [ ] Implement back the sections pattern in the new `NoteAdapter` (replacing the `ItemAdapter`)
- [ ] Add some separators between items (handled automatically by `ListView`, to do manually with a `RecyclerView`)

The `NoteAdapter` uses a `SortedList` to store `Notes`, and is always sorted (here's the fix to #30, mainly a side-effect of switching to `RecyclerView` ;-))

- [x] Because we have these date headers _and_ the sorting by date, I would not even show the relative dates or time in this list. It takes away focus from the notes, creates overflow problems with the note title if it’s long, and if one wants to know the exact date they can just open the note.

- Seems that the background for ours is a tad blue? Should probably be just black/grey and 50% (or 70%) opacity.
- Font-size could be decreased a bit to make more of the note readable. It’s quite important that the last visible line gets visually cut in half so it’s clear that the note continues.
- The font-weight should be a bit thinner too. But maybe that’s just because of the size.

We can simply show the title in the middle, the back button in the top left and the menu in the top right.

- [x] the OK button should be called »Connect« and have a spinner after clicked, and say »Connecting«. Also the input fields should be disabled to give better feedback that the process is running
- [x] I once got a checkmark right next to the server address field. Not sure if that meant the connection was then established?
- [x] hitting the back arrow on the top left causes a strange animation and all the fields to be deleted –> highly annoying
- [x] I found out you need to press the bottom »back« button to get the notes view! :D When the connection is successful, of course you should automatically be directed there
- [x] there was an error at the bottom (obscured by the Back/Home/Apps buttons) saying »URL Malformed«. Very strange technical message which doesn’t tell me what exactly the problem is. Can the server not be reached? Is http/https missing (again, add that automatically), what else?
- [x] then going to Settings presents me with again completely empty credential fields … instead the server address, username, and stars for the password (use existing one if not changed) should be preset so I don’t have to remember and put it in all over again – typing is the worst on mobile.
