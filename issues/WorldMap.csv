johnnylambada/WorldMap,closed,Fix Corner zoom Bug when starting from Intent.,[],"I start the app with:

Intent intent = new Intent(this, ImageViewerActivity.class);

johnnylambada/WorldMap,open,Saving zoom state,[],"This is a very fantastic library.
I have only a problem: I use 2.0.2 version and it is very simple to save the InstanceState of the viewport. I'm unable to save the zoom state, there is a way to save the zoom level of the last viewport? or it is possible to always start from the minimum zoom to display the entire image?
Any suggestion?
Thanks

johnnylambada/WorldMap,open,2.0.2 issues,[],"Having some problems with 2.0.2 

I can load a resource via setinputstream. e.g. - mWorldView.setInputStream(getResources().openRawResource(R.drawable.centerlogo));

When I call setinputstream again to change the image, it crashes. The inputstream I am feeding it is from the sd card

e.g. - is = (InputStream) new RandomAccessFileInputStream(file);
mWorldView.setInputStream(is);

johnnylambada/WorldMap,open,Pixelated image and crash on some devices,[],"Hi,
I tested worldmap and am using it in a project to display a big picture.

When I test your latest code on a Galaxy S3, I can reproduce an bug:
- un-zoom quickly to the minium zoom level with a pinch gesture
- zoom quickly on a country of the map.
- you will see that the country is pixelated and is never filled with the high resolution data. And you will experience an app crash some seconds after.
  (try this manipulation a few times if no problem detected)

It's like the cache is not re-computed.

I can reproduce this bug on Galaxy S3, GalaxyS2 and Galaxy Ace.

I will investigate the issue but if you have any idea it would be very welcomed.

I notice that I've got these errors in the logcat:
E/dalvikvm-heap(19564): Out of memory on a 38047104-byte allocation.
E/InputStreamScene(19564): caught oom -- cache now at 0 percent.

I also notice these errors: 
SKIA FimgApiStretch:stretch failed
But by [browsing online](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12068110/whats-the-reason-of-fimgapistretchstretch-failed-in-android), I can read that is only due to the Samsung phone.

johnnylambada/WorldMap,open,zooming in the right side.,[],"When ever the image is zoomed with the scaleFactor > 1f, parts of the right side begins to get cut off because the right side bound being reached.

if (x + w > size.x)
x = size.x - w;
if (y + h > size.y)
y = size.y - h; 

if the scalefactor < 1f in the above code, the bounds are being cut off way too early because w is greater than w/scalefactor

however if we change the piece of code to include the scalefactors the viewport becomes unstable

Is there a way to fix the size of the viewport so that when the viewport gets smaller and smaller we are still able to show the right side?
