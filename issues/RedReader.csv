This PR extracts the gilded property from the Reddit post object and displays a badge for gilded posts displaying the number of golds it receives. The badge is identical to the badge used for comments and is displayed in the subtitle on both the post list view and the post header. 
This badge is placed directly after the points span in the subtitle as shown below.

**Issue:** On emulators with Android 8.1 and up, sharing an image via the context menu throws an exception on builds from the master branch. The image gets downloaded like expected, but enters the ""mail the error"" screen instead of opening the share menu.

**Steps to reproduce:** 

1. Checkout master branch and build/run RedReader on a device with Android version >= 8.1
2. Long press on any image post
3. Choose ""Share Image""
4. The Application correctly asks for permissions, allow
5. Error Page should show up now

I got this fixed by using the method from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50265329) stackoverflow thread in the ImageCallback class. The answer mentions this is a problem for API levels 24 and up, though Android 7.1 (25) works as expected.
However, before just putting the pull request up, I think it would be great if other people, maybe with real devices, can confirm this and how to properly tackle the issue if it's confirmed.

Give the limitations of access to Reddit, maybe not having a ""->"" button is a design choice in order to avoid excessive accesses, but I wasn't sure so I decided to ask if you could implement it.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,Language temporarly resets to system language when opening external app,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Can't reproduce"")]","# Steps to reproduce

4. Exit external app, return to RedReader (Press back key)
5. Scroll down to load new content

Note: This only seem to happen when you get asked for an app when clicking on it, not when it opens the internal browser first and then opening the app from there.

# Expected behaviour

Language doesn't change.

# Actual behaviour

Language switches for new text. But most actions seems to fix it. (e. g. opening other subreddit, opening comments... Going back to main menu and clicking on ""reload"" doesn't and makes everything german/system language)

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,Add a blocklist to filter posts by (parts of) post.url,[],"This allows users to hide post based on their URLs, to filter out unwanted content sources. The blocklist can be edited via preferences.

During my usage of reddit I often want to filter out memes, for example. And those tend to come from certain hoster URLs and I just want to get rid of all of them. With this change I can add (for example) `""gfycat.com""` to the blocklist and get rid of all of them at once.

This is my first attempt at a new feature for *RedReader*. I tried to keep the change as small as possible and follow the general layout of the code. If there is anything wrong with the code or someone can give me tips how to improve, I appreciate all comments.

I only do Android development occasionally, so I couldn't really figure out how to have a nice preferences screen, where the user can add/remove entries to the blocklist, so I added the preferences value as a simple `EditTextPreference` where I can at least enter the blocklist entries separated with `;`...

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,Twitter special treatment,"[Label(name=""Enhancement"")]","Twitter's mobile site seems to be awful. Most of the time when opening reddit links to twitter, the first page load fails with a ""You are not authorised to view these tweets"" or ""Twitter took too long to respond"". Refreshes sometimes fix the issue. I've managed to reproduce this on a desktop by hitting `mobile.twitter.com` with the `User-Agent` and `X-Requested-With` headers set to the same as RedReader. Looking at the network console, the `https://api.twitter.com/2/timeline/conversation/$id.json` call literally just hangs.

This is undoubtedly a Twitter issue and - if I were to put my tin-foil hat on - is perhaps deliberate to encourage people to use the app rather than the mobile site.

It would be nice if RedReader could work around this by:

* Allowing users to enable desktop UA spoofing and suppressing the `X-Requested-With` header for Twitter to make the page loads as reliable as they are in a desktop browser"

1. it seems to uses a single thread (or maybe two threads) to download the data.
2. it prioritizes images/videos over post comments.
3. it takes ~same time to download and save a heavy video/image as it takes to download and save a single post's comments.

As a result - sometimes I suffer from:
1. posts at top of the list haven't been cached (because they are text posts), while images from image posts from below of the list - they get cached just fine.
2. It takes the same time to download 1 gb of images/videos as it takes to download, say, just 5 mb of text.
What are the bottle necks here?
Clearly it's not the network/disk bandwidth.
It is probably either disk i/o rate which or the number of threads used to download things.
Does RedReader use any SQL base to store text data into a DB file?
How many threads/pipelines does the application use to download stuff?


So, please:
1. add settings to control cache priority over data types (images/videos first, text comments first, whole posts sequentially [go sequentially through all posts from the list, caching both things at once for them: the image/video and comments])
2. add a setting to choose the number of threads/pipelines to be used to cache things."

Reddit's API endpoint /sendreplies is used for this.
About the actual implementation, I'm not sure if it would be more elegant to move the actual call into CommentReplyActivity, but then we have to escalate the id of the newly created post, which would entail some refactoring.

On another note, Reddit's API responses surely have to be a joke, right? No sane person could do that...

I ported @cprcrack's work on video enabled WebViews to the

I successfully tested viewing video both normally and in fullscreen
in OxygenOS Beta 25, which runs on Android 8.0.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,Connectivity problems,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Hi,

Especially on Wi-Fi, I get into the following situation:

1) I have RedReader running in memory.
2) I do not interact with the phone for some time, so it sleeps (couple dozen minutes, a few hours).
3) I unlock the phone, switch to RedReader and refresh the Front Page or any specific post comments.

What happens is that the loading never ends (does not even time out after several minutes). The only way to go about this is to manually kill the application and launch it again. Happens regularly, multiple times a day.

Now, I do not know anything about the internal design of the application, but it seems to me that you are leaving a TCP connection open for the entire time the application is running, and the loss of connectivity—possibly caused by the phone turning off Wi-Fi during sleep—makes that connection die. If that is indeed the case, I would like to ask you to change the behaviour so that a refresh operation always opens a new connection and closes it immediately after the operation finishes.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,Suggestion for improving image loading,"[Label(name=""Duplicate""), Label(name=""Enhancement"")]","Dear developers,

I am a user of RedReader, and thank you for the wonderful work.

When I click an item and browse it's image, for some large images, the downloading process will take a long time. 
For example, the situation below can consume more than 10 seconds:

![20170326142421](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19150666/24329175/82951692-1230-11e7-850c-e36ddec9eb69.jpg)

In many cases images are larger than required. Android documentation suggests us to resize the image according to the size of the UI component that displays it. By properly resizing image before downloading and decoding, we can save memory resource and make app run more smoothly, which can provide users with a better experience.
https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/load-bitmap.html#read-bitmap

I noticed that in the following code, image resizing is correctly applied:
org.quantumbadger.redreader.views.imageview.ImageTileSourceBitmapRegionDecoder.java   getTile()
https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/blob/master/src/main/java/org/quantumbadger/redreader/views/imageview/ImageTileSourceBitmapRegionDecoder.java#L75

However, in the code below, images are decoded directly without resizing:
org.quantumbadger.redreader.activities.ImgurUploadActivity.java  (line number 213)
https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/blob/master/src/main/java/org/quantumbadger/redreader/activities/ImgurUploadActivity.java#L213

https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/blob/master/src/main/java/org/quantumbadger/redreader/adapters/AlbumAdapter.java#L157

I am not familiar with the source code of RedReader, so I am not sure whether the code listed above corresponds to the situation I described. However, whether it is or not, I think they all need to be optimized.

Do you think image resizing will improve RedReader' performance? If yes, perhaps resizing image before downloading can make RedReader more smooth in user interaction.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,Gyfycat always opens mp4 even though it's largest option.,"[Label(name=""Enhancement"")]","It's doing this for some reason that I don't understand. Yes the full size mp4 is ~3x the bitrate but this is a _gif_ file that's being viewed the webm is _more_ than enough for a 1280x720 screen plus the built in video player I imagine plays webm's just fine.

So if not possible to just do the webm make an option to chose default format for gyfycat as I don't have the time to sit around for a 10MB gif to download(yes it'sa  video but still) for 15s of video.

tl;dr
15s of video for 10MiB is insane and isn't worth the wait time. Switch to webm as it's more than enough bitrate ~1.8Mb/s and this is a gif not a movie the whole point is to save download time not make it wait almost as long as gifs would have previously.


P.S.

The original gif is 12MB the mp4 is 10MB the webm meanwhile is 3.5MB

Here is another example.

https://gfycat.com/LargeLoneBlueandgoldmackaw

.gif is 5.4MB
.mp4 is 7.1MB
.webm is 3.4MB

here's yet one more

gif          gif        2560x1440  60fps, 11.23MiB
webm         webm       2560x1440  60fps, 14.40MiB
mp4          mp4        2560x1440  60fps, 35.96MiB (best)

that's an example of one where the resolution lies though I have manually downlaoded each of the files via my browser and the file sizes match up the gif though is only 445x240

the examples speak the truth when it comes to gfycat the mp4 is largest(always) webm is much smaller and almost _usually_ smaller than the gif. I think I found a weird outlier but then again the mp4/webm is ~34 times as large in terms of pixels in the frames than the gif.

the webms are vp9 and I don't know if the redreader itself supports it but the webms do play

Note: Your XML files (or at least strings.xml) seem to use a mix of tabs and spaces.  The editorconfig suggests that you want tabs, but I set it to spaces in my code, because that was what the majority of the file used and I wanted it to blend in.  You may want to do a conversion to one of the two later though.

Added it as an option under Behaviour -> Posts. I understand the short link is better for sharing and saving space, so I made it an option, and by default it is off.

The feature was born out of a discussion with a friend: I send too many links and with the long url he is able to filter uninteresting ones, or those he has already seen, without the need to click.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,closed,LinkDetailsView intended consequence,[],"I've been looking into converting `LinkDetailsView` into xml, but have a  question on the intended outcome of overriding `onInterceptTouchEvent()`. It appears that when you click on it the border highlights blue and when you come back from the link, it stays blue. However as it is in a `RecyclerView` it reverts back to the default grey colour when you scroll down and up again. So is this supposed to just be like a `selector` where you highlight the box on button hold and then reverts back, or something else? The method in question is [here](https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/blob/master/src/main/java/org/quantumbadger/redreader/views/LinkDetailsView.java#L86).

As I'm refactoring the `MainMenuAdapter`, do you want me to add the subheader ""Reddit"" to the top, as it appears in code but is commented out, so I guess that you had the intention of adding that. Also a question on dividers: what do you think about having full bleed dividers above the subheaders (except the ""Reddit"" one if you want to add it), and getting rid of the dividers for the elements of the headers to reduce visual noise? Ref: [Under section Subheaders and dividers](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dividers.html#dividers-types-of-dividers).

In rare cases (that I haven't been able to pin down), it's even possible for the text to align onto FEWER lines, cutting off some of the content.

I believe I have a potential fix, in which we basically just set an overlay in place of the thumbnail and give it a default image (otherwise it doesn't look as good on the ""Night"" theme; I've used the comment icon for now).  This has the added bonus of lining up all text regardless of the presence of a thumbnail.

Replicant has no hardware acceleration and only uses software rendering. The software rendering implementation is more or less the same as the one the emulator is using.
Would it be possible to add a fallback for the image view that works with the software renderer?
An alternative would be to provide an option that allows to use an external gallery application instead of the internal image view, just like the already existing option to use an external app as video viewer. Watching gifs/videos with vlc works using this option.

Many thanks for working on this app! It works otherwise great on Replicant!

In my opinion RedReader should implement the same/similar feature. 

A second level comment has enough space left to it. So i propose that tapping this space will collapse the tree, just like long pressing and choosing the option in the menu would do.

If the new one is different, then the user has received a new message and a notification is broadcast to the user.

When the user taps this notification, it starts the app and there is a check in MainActivity of the Intent created by the activity to find out whether it is from a new message notification. If so, the inbox is opened for the user to view the new message they received.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,open,feature - increase on disk security ,"[Label(name=""Enhancement"")]","Hello. This is follow on from #147 

The guardianproject created a number of libraries for developers to use in their software to improve their security.

I would like to make the suggestion that you implement their IOCipher and SQLCipher[1] libraries into RedReader

The biggest benefits would be

IOCipher:
- On install users could create a password specific to RedReader, this would then protect all RedReader files inside an encrypted container.

If on install a user chose not to set a password RedReader would be stored on the device as normal

SQLCipher
- provide an encrypted sqlite database to ensure information is kept secure.

QuantumBadger/RedReader,closed,[Top Priority] Issue where only two posts are shown in cached version,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","I'm completely stumped on this issue, I hope someone can give some advice.

RedReader displays posts as they are downloaded. The updatePosts() method in PostListingAdapter.java is called every time the items shown in the UI need to be updated. 

However, the ListView component (created in PostListingFragment.java) sometimes stops growing after two posts. Attempting to scroll this two-element-high list view eventually makes it relayout properly and fill the whole screen, but until the user does this the listview doesn't resize.

notifyDataSetChanged() is being called, which should (in theory) be the only thing which needs to be done. I've also tried several different kinds of invalidation, manually setting the listview's layout height to FILL_PARENT, overriding onAttachedToWindow in the outer layout to get the layout height to ""FILL_PARENT"", and so on. Nothing seems to work.

"
QuantumBadger/RedReader,closed,Questionable progress bar design,"[Label(name=""Enhancement"")]","The blue progress bar that is shown, for example, when opening the comments disappears with a hiding animation. This animation happens when the comments are already displayed. The user sees that all the comments are already retrieved but is **forced to wait for the animation** to end until the comments can be read. This breaks the reading flow and it is annoying to be slowed down and having to **focus on the comments several times** until they reach their final position.

Additionally, I'm wondering why there is such a prominent progress bar at all. Diode, for example, uses a tiny progress bar that glows while loading and is afterwards just a thin horizontal rule. This way, the content (in this case the comments) is not moved around, but **stays where it is initially displayed**. There is **no delay** slowing down the user. If the content cannot be loaded, an error message is shown.

To me the information of the current progress bar seems to be superfluous. ""Connecting, downloading, done"" can be **impossible to read on a fast connection**, because the whole procedure takes only a fraction of a second. On a slow connection it can be read, but **what difference does it make** to the user, if the app is connecting or downloading? What is the difference between seeing that the content is displayed and reading ""done""? Android already tells the user whether it is connected to the Internet, therefore the only useful information is whether the content can be shown or not.

If the page has been successfully loaded, it should be displayed **without delay and without further movements**. If the page could not be loaded, maybe because reddit is down, an error message might be easiest to understand.

If I'm not mistaken major browsers do it like this: Have one indicator, often a simple graphical loading indicator like in Chrome, for the whole connecting, downloading, processing procedure. If the content is retrieved, display it as fast as possible without any further movements. If the content cannot be retrieved, display an error message.

Just imagine your browser using the verbose progress bar of RedReader. Maybe hundreds of times a day, you read the same three words (if they can be read at all) and every page moves around after it is already displayed. **""click-read""** becomes **""click-connecting-downloading-done-animation-read""**.

One last word on the graphical loading indicator. I wouldn't be surprised if one reason for the use of a graphical indicator was that words can hardly be not read and not mentally processed once they are seen. A rotating circle (like in Chrome) or a filling loading bar (like in Diode) might lead to **less distracting mental processing** and make it easier to concentrate on the content. To me the tranquilizing rotating circle or filling bar say: ""Put your brain into standby and wait until you see the content."" On the other hand, ""Connecting, downloading, done"" says: ""Do you still remember how complicated it is just to display a couple of comments to you?""

Might be because I'm forcing tablet mode on my phone though, either way just FYI
