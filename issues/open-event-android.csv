There is no specific button open login screen, only way to open it is opening tickets or profile tab.
There should be a option to login on first tab(that is events tab), probably a FAB would be the best.

In my opinion Login Screen should open first on first launch of the app (like most of the apps have) , user would have an option to login later .

fossasia/open-event-android,closed,chore(deps): bump retrofit from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0,"[Label(name=""dependencies"")]","Bumps [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [retrofit's changelog](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*

> Version 2.5.0 *(2018-11-18)*
> ----------------------------
> 
>  * New: Built-in support for Kotlin's `Unit` type. This behaves the same as Java's `Void` where the body
>    content is ignored and immediately discarded.
>  * New: Built-in support for Java 8's `Optional` and `CompletableFuture` types. Previously the 'converter-java8'
>    and 'adapter-java8' dependencies were needed and explicitly adding `Java8OptionalConverterFactory` and/or
>    `Java8CallAdapterFactory` to your `Retrofit.Builder` in order to use these types. Support is now built-in and
>    those types and their artifacts are marked as deprecated.
>  * New: `Invocation` class provides a reference to the invoked method and argument list as a tag on the
>    underlying OkHttp `Call`. This can be accessed from an OkHttp interceptor for things like logging, analytics,
>    or metrics aggregation.
>  * New: Kotlin extension for `Retrofit` which allows you call `create` passing the interface type only as
>    a generic parameter (e.g., `retrofit.create<MyService>()`).
>  * New: Added `Response.success` overload which allows specifying a custom 2xx status code.
>  * New: Added `Calls.failure` overload which allows passing any `Throwable` subtype.
>  * New: Minimal R8 rules now ship inside the jar requiring no client configuration in the common case.
>  * Fix: Do not propagate fatal errors to the callback. They are sent to the thread's uncaught
>    exception handler.
>  * Fix: Do not enqueue/execute an otherwise useless call when the RxJava type is disposed by `onSubscribe`.
>  * Fix: Call `RxJavaPlugins` assembly hook when creating an RxJava 2 type.
>  * Fix: Ensure both the Guava and Java 8 `Optional` converters delegate properly. This ensures that converters
>    registered prior to the optional converter can be used for deserializing the body type.
>  * Fix: Prevent `[**Path**](https://github.com/Path)` values from participating in path-traversal. This ensures untrusted input passed as
>    a path value cannot cause you to make a request to an un-intended relative URL.
>  * Fix: Simple XML converter (which is deprecated) no longer wraps subtypes of `RuntimeException`
>    or `IOException` when it fails.
>  * Fix: Prevent JAXB converter from loading remote entities and DTDs.
>  * Fix: Correctly detect default methods in interfaces on Android (API 24+). These still do not work, but
>    now a correct exception will be thrown when detected.
>  * Fix: Report more accurate exceptions when a `[**QueryName**](https://github.com/QueryName)` or `[**QueryMap**](https://github.com/QueryMap)` precedes a `[**Url**](https://github.com/Url)` parameter.
>  * Update OkHttp dependency to 3.12.

fossasia/open-event-android,closed,fix: Fix the no connectivity case bug on Main Activity,[],"Improve logic of code to handle no connectivity better on refresh by showing the no internet card instantaneously, hide the refreshing layout, and not initiating non-required calls to network methods.

Fixes #691 
Changes: 

The code logic has been modified to handle the issue mentioned.

Screenshots for the change:
Before:
Refreshing the event list (one fully loaded) under no internet:
(This state remains for a long time as the connection methods are called, and finally terminates after 8-10 secs with a toast)

![screenshot_1542134680](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31897110/48436691-5f57a680-e7a5-11e8-9dff-f1c14010b63e.png)

After making the changes, and refreshing the events list (once fully loaded) under no internet:

![screenshot_1542135460](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31897110/48436650-3f27e780-e7a5-11e8-9bf3-6c21124520c4.png)
"
fossasia/open-event-android,closed,No internet case not handled properly in the main activity,[],"**Description**

Once the events on the main screen have been loaded, if the internet connection is lost, and the user refreshes the list, the code makes the request to the server, hence the SwipeRefreshLayout keeps refreshing for a while (about 8-10 secs), after which a toast appears: ""Error fetching events""

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to main activity with the internet connection working, let it load all events.
2. Turn on flight mode.
3. Refresh the events list.


**Expected behavior**

The no internet card should appear instantaneously, the app should not initiate call to the server (via retryLoadLocationEvents() method), and the swipe refresh layout should stop refreshing.


**Screenshots**

![screenshot_1542134680](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31897110/48435599-e9524000-e7a2-11e8-8179-911af25d1a88.png)

**Would you like to work on the issue?**
Yes, working on it."
fossasia/open-event-android,open,Add Goto Search button in empty Likes tab,[],"**Describe the feature you'd like**
Add a **Goto Events** Button in the Likes tab when its empty.

**Additional context**
The **Likes** tab simply have a message saying ""Find something to do"", which can be represented better by a button that takes the user to events tab.

Switching to Gradle v3.2.1 resolves this error, but causes the Travis CI builds to fail because the current travis.yml file does not allow support for build tools v28.

fossasia/open-event-android,closed,Add support for Build Tool v28 and Gradle 3.2.1 to travis.yml file,[],"**Describe the chore**
The latest version of Android studio is incompatible with the Gradle version used in this project (gradle:3.2.0-alpha16). Whenever the project is imported into Android Studio, the developers are presented with this error:

If the developer updates the Gradle version to 3.2.1 and creates commits to this repository, the Travis CI builds for those commit fail with the following error:

```

  Alternatively, to transfer the license agreements from one workstation to another, see http://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/export-licenses.html

> 
> - Official lib bug fixes
>   - `PreferenceThemeOverlay` has been updated to the latest material theme. If no custom theme is provided, `PreferenceThemeOverlay` is used as the default theme.
>   - `PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14` and `PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14.Material` themes have been deprecated in favour of `PreferenceThemeOverlay`.
>   - `PreferenceGroup` visibility is now tied to its children - hiding a parent group will also prevent its children from being shown in the hierarchy. Use `Preference.isShown()` to get whether a `Preference` is actually displayed to the user in the hierarchy.
>   - `Preference.onSetInitialValue(boolean, Object)` has been deprecated and replaced with `onSetInitialValue(Object)`. PreferenceDataStore now also correctly restores default values.
> - added `onSetInitialValue(Object)` implementation and removed the deprecated `onSetInitialValue(boolean, Object)`
