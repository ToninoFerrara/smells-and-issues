xgouchet/Ted,closed,Enhanced crash consistency,[],"Our automatic tool confirmed that the original save pattern (write data -> delete file -> rename file) can lead to user data loss at power down or system crash.

Enhanced crash consistency by performing buffer flush and file system synchronization in file saving. This also ensures the user's file is saved immediately.

xgouchet/Ted,open,EOF crouton message appears many times when a search next button is pressed many times,[],"Hi,

When I try to search for a certain word and the search reaches EOF or no more matches found, the crouton message appears correctly saying ""No more match found in the current file"". But when I continue clicking on search next/previous many times, the crouton message appears many times equal to how many times I pressed on the button, and it will prevent any other messages to appear, say if I saved the file for instance, until it finishes the previous events.

So is there anyway that when any event/button is pressed and you are about to show a message, so you can clear all croupon messages and show the current one immediately.

Thanks,

xgouchet/Ted,closed,Ted eating all CPU on HTC G1,[],
xgouchet/Ted,open,wrapped line numbers increase,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","when wrapping and line numbers are enabled, a single logical line gets assigned increasing line numbers.

in a file in which every line consists of the same letter, this looks like this:

```
1 aaaa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa
2 aa aaa aaaa aaaa
3 bbbb b bbb bb bbbb bb bbbbbbb
4 bb
```

instead of:

```
1 aaaa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa
  aa aaa aaaa aaaa
2 bbbb b bbb bb bbbb bb bbbbbbb
  bb
```

which is common in other text editors (compare vim, gedit), and is reasonable, as screen size dependent line numbers have no further meaning.

the new behavior would make it possible to find line numbers given by external programs or users on other devices, and would make it clear that the ""word wrap"" option only breaks lines for printing, and doesn't insert newlines.
