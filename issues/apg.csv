thialfihar/apg,closed,PGPSignatureList before PGPLiteralData,[],"There is a problem decrypting messages sent from a blackberry phone with PGP Universal Server.

There is no error or exception, but the message always comes out blank. Messages sent from a blackberry have a PGPSignatureList block before PGPLiteralData and because of this the execution never reaches PGPLiteralData code block to read the actual message text.

This is a quick fix that skips the signature block. Its probably not a proper fix, but at least I can see the message text now.
