-Added German translation for array.xml (may need corrections)
-PasswordInput.java: moved the array with the values for password strength to array.xml, so those values can be translated, too
-SealnoteFragment.java: changed the hardcoded string at line 182, now it's read from strings.xml (and added the translation for the string to strings-de.xml); there is still a problem since this approach doesn't allow to correctly translate the sentence to languages where Archive and Trash require being preceded by different articles depending on the word (like Italian) or where Archive and Trash are of different genders and require the adjective for ""empty"" to be concordant with the gender. I thought of two possible ways to solve this, but implemented neither since you might want to decide your preferred approach:
--use a different string for each folder; this would require some change in the code in order to retrieve the correct string at runtime; I can do this if you're ok with it
--use only the word ""empty"" without naming the folder"

vishesh/sealnote,open,In-app 2 factor authentication,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","For example, if a person was to store their Google account login details on SealNote, why not implement an extra field for those using 2FA for their account? It would allow people to delete the old, obsolete and insecure Google authenticator app (for those who still use that), plus it shouldn't be too hard to implement as there is plenty of freely available code regarding 2FA out there. As for the barcode scanner, those who use 2FA have a barcode scanner installed already.

Please ignore the washing machine sound in the background."
vishesh/sealnote,open,Feature ideas. ,[],"1- Hide password fields and make password fields read only (to avoid accidental edit or removal). The password can be revealed via a touch. 

2- The tag system is great but I suggest using something else than a space as a delimiter, as some people may need multiple word tags.

3- Fingerprint unlock (without losing two factor auth). Two issues may be brought up with this idea (older phones and security). The fingerprint could be used to store only the last 3 characters of the password, where the rest of the password could be stored in the keychain, which does keep a 2FA system in place. As for the older phone argument, let's be real for a second, how many non tech savy people will look for a secure open source note app? Most tech savy people have newer phones in this economy üòâ. The feature should be optional anyway. 

4- Search feature. If SealNote is to be used heavily (as a password manager for example), it can quickly become cluttered. A search feature would fix this issue. 

5- In-app 2 factor authentication system. For example, if a person was to store their Google account login details on SealNote, why not implement an extra field for those using 2FA for their account? It would allow people to delete the old,  obsolete and insecure Google authenticator app (for those who still use that), plus it shouldn't be too hard to implement as there is plenty of freely available code regarding 2FA out there. As for the barcode scanner, those who use 2FA have a barcode scanner installed already. 

6- A separate and insecure database to provide a replacement for Google Keep. People could then use SealNote via a Google Keep like widget for daily tasks like shopping lists and todo lists, etc... The issue here would obviously be the confusion factor of secure and insecure features within the same app, but a warning pop-up when an insecure note is created should fix that. 

Those are just some ideas to make the app a true ""go to"" app for everyone looking for secure, open source note and password storage. Please tell me what you guys think about it. "

vishesh/sealnote,open,Tagedit View repeats characters on its own,[],"Hello Vishesh - looking for a open-source notepad (as starting point for Java with Android) I found your ""Sealnote"". Following issue though: When adding tags, on some devices the Textview starts typing its own characters, i.e. repeating characters. Example typing ""abcde"":

Typing <-> on screen
a => a (ok)
b => ab (ok)
c => ababc (ab wrongly repeated)
d => ababcd (ok)
e => ababcdabcde (abcd wrongly repeated)

I think something with TagTextWatcher->beforeTextChanged. The ""mShouldMove"" is set to true although not needed (at least for the first tag), and setting it to false allows proper (sequential) entering of tags. Strangely, only happening on some devices (Galaxy Tab S, but not on virtual devices). Maybe for consideration with the next version.

Otherwise, very nice program (especially the UI!). Thank you for making it available here!

2. tap the first line of the note: cursor moves to the first line of note text, the note is scrolled up so that the first line is positioned at the very top of the screen and is covered by the toolbar. The toolbar is semi-transparent but it has opaque icons so it makes the first 1-2 lines of the note very difficult to read and edit.

In my opinion cursor should never go under the toolbar - transparent or not, note should be scrolled in such a way that cursor is positioned in the clear part of the screen. Samsung Galaxy S5, Lollipop. Otherwise great program, like it.
