palfrey/postcode,closed,Offline postcodes!,[],"Hi,
I really liked your app but I don't always have an internet connection when I want to know what postcode I'm in. So, I pulled the OS OpenNames data myself, wrote a quick python script to turn it into a db with postcodes, latitudes and longitudes, and integrated this with your app. It might need some cleaning up but with a modern phone (all UK postcodes fit into 90MB! And is read off the sdcard so internal storage is not an issue) it should be fine...

I've included my python script and the source CSVs (obtained from getting all the zips [extracting all the links in the email into a file, and iterating over it, wgetting them], unzipping them [`unzip -u *zip*`] and taking the `DATA` folder) I used to generate the sqlite database, feel free to use as much/little of this as you want.
