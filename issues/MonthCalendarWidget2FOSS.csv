Could it then choose to abbreviate weekday names even more, if needed? On my system, if I have a 2x2 monthcalendar widget, then MON gets wrapped to MO[newline]N, while the other weekdays are displayed fine in one line TUE, WED, etc). And the rest of the calendar looks fine. But, in this case, MO TU WE TH FR SA SU could be chosen and would give a better result.

Ah, I see now that also longer month names, August--February, gets separated from the year, as so: monthname[newline]year, and this causes clipping of the top and the botton of that text. Well, then I suppose months could be abbreviated, as well, when need be. Aug, Sep, Oct, ...

I like the idea of this simple calendar!

alterechtschreibung/MonthCalendarWidget2FOSS,closed,Problem with displaying some months,[],"Hi,

I suggest to apply this patch:
https://github.com/romannurik/Android-MonthCalendarWidget/commit/f198096a4c2f9db2b98fc41f6fb57087558c21c6
because without this modification I can't change month from January to February 2015.

Or just upload upstream version to F-Droid :-P
