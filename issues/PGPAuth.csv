LittleFox94/PGPAuth,open,Minor grammar issue in the about section.,[],"Name: PGPAuth - from F-Droid.
Version: 1.7.1

In the about section of the app where:
""...request to *an* defined..."", ""an"" is used instead of ""a"". In writing ""an"" is used before a vowel sound. Vowels: A, I, O, U. 

The fix:
Replace the ""an"" with ""a"". 

Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks in advance.
