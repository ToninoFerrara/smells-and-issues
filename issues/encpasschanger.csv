kibab/encpasschanger,open,resurrection of EncPassChanger,[],"@kibab do you think it is possible to update this app for newer android versions?

since the debug output looks good until the password-change itself, i guess just the syntax needs an update to the current one `vdc cryptfs changepw password 'current-password' 'new-password'`.
for more information have a look at [my comment](https://github.com/nelenkov/cryptfs-password-manager/issues/19#issuecomment-341988458) (especially the bigger part).
i know the app is FOSS but i'm sadly not a developer, just familiar with the command-line... else i would have done it.

_it would be awesome to have have a GUI (again) for non-experts to change/set the disk encryption password (independent from the lock screen password), since also [SnooperStopper](https://github.com/xmikos/SnooperStopper) and [Cryptfs Password](https://github.com/nelenkov/cryptfs-password-manager) (on which SnooperStopper is based) also stopped working quite a while ago.
it seems that this app is the easiest one and has the fewest bugs to fix (the other ones close immediately and pretend that they can't get root-access, although they ask for it and i granted it permanently)._

my additional 2 cents:
if it is easily possible i would also add a waring to backup all data before every time using the app (on their own risk) and maybe also a hint to run the app again and change/set the boot-password after every change of the lock-screen."

kibab/encpasschanger,open,basic support for reboot on configurable failed unlock attempts,[],"Implemented a device administration component that reboots the phone on a configurable fialed unlock attempts.

It works for me (in a nexus 4), but it needs some love in the gui and a code cleanup.
