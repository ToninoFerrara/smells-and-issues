It would be cool if other apps could open YouTube links with it (right now some links open the app and pass a search, some just open the app with a blank search, and some just don't get the option at all - from trying random posts from reddit).

I get it if it's been abandoned and people have moved on to other apps, but I still liked this one. Is it just a false sense of security that I don't see the video, or am I really only using the bandwidth of the audio?"
