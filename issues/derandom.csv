asnelt/derandom,closed,usage,[],"So I just checked out this app
And I'm a bit confused.
I typed in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 etc (seperated by a new line) You'd expect it to say 8 9 10 etc
So how exactly can this be used?
In no way does it output any logical number that you'd expect in this sequence even if it's just simple one like adding 1 every time.
