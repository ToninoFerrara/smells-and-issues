This isn't pretty and could use some cleanup/refactoring, but since I'm quite short on time at the moment, I thought I'd get it out anyway.
It would be great if someone could review and test.

Different clusters in the map can, for the moment use the same colour, later perhaps, different colours.
Here is a ""nice colours"" random generator: https://randomcolor.llllll.li/ .

One's own position, regardless whether it is part of the ""mass line"" or not, should always be shown as it is now.

An additional velocity filter could be perhaps useful to only cluster positions senders within a certain range of velocities.

CriticalMaps/criticalmaps-android,open,Reduce amount of data transferred,[],"Yesterday I took part in the Fahrradsternfahrt to Berlin. During 4 hours, my phone spent almost 20 MB. I don't have a generous data plan, and this was way beyond my ""daily allowance"".

There seem to be multiple factors contributing to this rather large amount of data:
 - I could find no way to use offline maps (I'm using them with Locus, and c:geo, thus a newer mapsforge interrface should work)
- There seems to be no map tile caching
- The app appears to load map tiles even if it's only running in the background (I don't have proof for that, except that between two consecutive unlocks, more than 5 MB had been spent). Actually, my phone reports twice the amount of data transferred in the background compared to foreground usage (i.e. when I was zooming and panning around for other participants)!

While a typical CM will take place in a well-defined, small area, such a setup like the Sternfahrt would cover long distances and therefore would trigger more map reloads than usual.

Is there an overview what kind of data gets transmitted (sent, and received) in which situations?
I'd expect my own location to be sent every now and then (10 - 15 seconds?) but other locations, and map tiles, only pulled if there are any participants within my view window, and *none of that* while running in the background.

I'm back to Herve Renault's self-hosted location tracking service for now (which consumes <1/4 kB per my location report).

Wishlist (in decreasing order of importance to me):
- option to use off-line maps (must-have)
- no map tile loading in the background at all (important)
- reduce traffic to a minimum in bg mode (only report own location; perhaps notify of chat? - normal)
- option to opt out of chat etc.

Thanks!"

CriticalMaps/criticalmaps-android,closed,Color cleanup,[],"I think we have some cleanup to do regarding the different colors used in the app, especially when moving to a more material design. So firstly this reduces the number of colors by trying to replace them by a few common ones. Secondly this moves all color definitions to the colors.xml to have them in a common place.
Obviously this changes the appearance of the app a bit. Something that proved a bit problematic is that our current primary primary dark color is really close to the default Theme.Appcompat window background. Especially I'm not too happy with the background of the chat edittext (even though I think it'll just do for now). Therefore I added it to the colors and style, to prepare a change here.
So this should be seen as a first step to get things organized and moving to a defined palette of colors that covers all use cases and can be used in all our UI elements. I'll probably open a new issue regarding this.

i think that if we implement something like that, we should make the difference in color very subtle in order to not confuse people. also it might be tricky to communicate to the user what those different colors actually mean.

I would suggest keeping a local copy of the overlays as a normal Arraylist in MapFragment. Then we could update the existing ones and add and remove as needed on each refresh in that local list.

```
HTTP is the way modern applications network. It’s how we exchange data & media. Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.

OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default:

HTTP/2 and SPDY support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
Connection pooling reduces request latency (if SPDY isn’t available).
Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.
OkHttp perseveres when the network is troublesome: it will silently recover from common connection problems. If your service has multiple IP addresses OkHttp will attempt alternate addresses if the first connect fails. This is necessary for IPv4+IPv6 and for services hosted in redundant data centers. OkHttp initiates new connections with modern TLS features (SNI, ALPN), and falls back to TLS 1.0 if the handshake fails.

CriticalMaps/criticalmaps-android,closed,improve softkeyboard handling,[],"When the softkeyboard has been opened at least once in the chat fragment,
it needs to be hidden on fragment change since the chat fragment is still
in a ""visible"" state and the EditText keeps focus. As of now this is done
by hiding the keyboard whenever a new tab is selected. Unfortunately this
doesn't handle the case when the Activity is resumed via notification
since the EditText still gets the focus and therefore the keyboard is
opened again.
This patch works around this by making the parent Layout focusable and
removing focus from the EditText when leaving the chat fragment. Also only
do this when we're leaving the chat fragment.

CriticalMaps/criticalmaps-android,closed,Hinweis auf Tracking,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Moin!

Schönes Projekt. Ich finde es bedenklich, dass die App quasi immer im Hintergrund trackt ohne den benutzer wirklich drauf hinzuweisen. Da fänd ich einen permanenten Hinweis innerhalb der App schon ganz gut, solange das Tracking aktiviert ist. Die Trackt ja auch im Hintergrund, da sollte es dann auch einen Hinweis als Notification geben.
