If a tower info fragment is open when user changes its transparency, it now updates instantly. To do that, ThemeManager calls TowerInfoFragment directly.

- do not stack heal effect
- stars can't heal other stars (except self)
- reduce stacking effect for each additional healer in the area
- one heal should heal a fixed number of HP and distribute it among all units in the effect's area (maybe combined with reduced stacking)

It is easy to lose track when there is so much action going on all over the battle-field.

Color-codes or overlay icons will add clutter and make the screen unreadable, therefore I suggest the use of a so-called *quasi-mode*, as defined by Jef Raskin in the book ""The humane interface"".

Unlike a classical mode (e.g. pressing `caps lock`), a quasi-mode is only active for as long as an action is being performed (e.g. holding `shift`).

In the case of this excellent game, there is no more room for buttons and every cell is valuable. There is one exception - the trench itself. That space is technically unused (and that's a lot of real estate). I suggest a `tap and hold` gesture anywhere on the trench to display an overlay above each unit, which will visualize its level.

As soon as the finger is raised, the overlay disappears and the game is rendered as usual. This is a non-invasive approach that doesn't clutter the screen and is very easy to invoke, and most importantly - very easy to dismiss."

- When a level is chosen, MainActivity is started with an intent extra that specifies which level to load
- added some misc graphics and thumbnails for this activity

Added new levels

This sort of makes sense, and makes the player think twice before spending money for the short term. Then again, I think the upgrade price should go down even if a little bit when enhancing. Since enhancing increases the sell price, sometimes it gets to a point where it's cheaper to sell a very enhanced turret and start from scratch with a number of upgrades instead of upgrading it directly.

What about reducing the upgrade cost at the same rate that the sell cost is increased? That would nullify this effect.

reloZid/android-anuto,closed,New strategies: how close they are to the end,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]","This is similar to First/Last. Those keep track of the first/last in the order in which they were spawned. I would find First/Last in the order in which they are getting to the end more useful.

For example, if I have a sniper turret to catch those that run past my other turrets, I want the First as in the one that's closest to the end. But it will probably not be the first to spawn, as a faster enemy could be the first in progress but not the first to have spawned.

Don't know if these strategies should be added in parallel (with new names) or if they should replace the existing. I don't think I'd ever find the current ones useful.

reloZid/android-anuto,closed,Cannon shoots from its last position,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","If the cannon (third turret at second level) aims at a different angle when shooting, the projectile animation starts from its old position instead of the new one. Easily spotted if the cannon was shooting downward and suddenly shoots upward - the projectile appears to shoot from its back.

Same might happen with other turrets, haven't been able to tell very well.

As you can see on the picture the screen is full of ""monsters"". But on the screenshot you cannot see that at this point the game is lagging a lot !!

They never stop (and think that they are stronger)

reloZid/android-anuto,closed,Free unlimited credit bug,[],"Lower selling price of the **all** upgraded items.

Example: 
If I put the last gun and upgrade it: 
500 + 800 = 1300
then I can sell it at 1750 !!

Free unlimited credit !!

reloZid/android-anuto,closed,Traps stop working,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","My strategy for level 41 with a lot of self healing star enemies is to set up an array of pulling traps. After some time they seem not to entrap new enemies within range. Is that so and if it is, is it on purpose?
"
reloZid/android-anuto,closed,Crash on too many turrets,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","While testing #7, I found that the game slowed down when a significant number (around the top third to half of the screen) of turrets were placed. The game will crash before you are able to fill the screen with turrets. Tested on Moto G 2015.
"
reloZid/android-anuto,closed,Dark/Inverted mode needed,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","After playing the game for 10~15 mins, I got it burned into my LCD screen. I have an LG G4, it is a known problem. I assume that a dark mode would avoid such problem.

Overall great game,
Cheers

reloZid/android-anuto,closed,Easy to cheat the game,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","1. buy that slowdown turret for 500 credits
2. upgrade it (once or twice)
3. sell it

The amount you get back is larger than the amount you invested. This can be used to cheat as much credits as you want.
