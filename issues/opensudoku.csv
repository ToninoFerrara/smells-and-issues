"
romario333/opensudoku,closed,Night theme / simple auto-solver,[],"This adds 3 features to OpenSudoku:

1- a simple green-on-black ""night"" theme.
2- a setting to automatically update fill-notes after a change.
3- an option to auto-solve trivial moves ... this works with the fill-notes features by solving unambiguous single notes. A demo of it can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1yzLl6TK6Y -- Obviously the solver is just a little fun thing, not serious. It's a setting that I don't think people would activate all the time, if at all.

I wrote these changes back in 2010 and ported them to OpenSudoku 1.1.5

romario333/opensudoku,closed,Fix issues 100 and 101.,[],"This fixes issues 100 and 101.  There is a new input mode to highlight cells with a certain value and when you set a cell's value, it will remove that value from all the affected cells' notes.
"
romario333/opensudoku,closed,"Allow ""Set Checkpoint"" on an empty command stack",[],"I have added a NoOpCommand subclass of AbstractCommand. If a user attempts to set a checkpoint on an empty command stack (for example, when coming back to a partially completed puzzle after rebooting the device) a NoOpCommand is pushed to the command stack before setCheckpoint(true) is called. The NoOpCommand has no other behaviors.
"
romario333/opensudoku,closed,Fill notes automatically & added Language: Afrikaans,[],"I wanted the notes of other cells to update automatically if enabled, when inputting a new value into a selected cell.
This is done by calling fillInNotes() from setCellValue()

I have also added Language: Afrikaans
