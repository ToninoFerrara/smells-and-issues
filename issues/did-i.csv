blaztriglav/did-i,closed,Fragment UI doesn't refresh after deleting habits in EditHabits Activity,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Steps to replicate:
- create two habits in EditHabits
- go back/up to the fragments, everything updates
- go back to EditHabits, delete one habit
- back/up to the fragments, UI doesn't update, despite loadUI being called in onResume;

No clue what is going on here. Same code gets called both times to update the UI, works one way, not the other.

blaztriglav/did-i,closed,"Automatic ""no"" for unanswered days new year issue","[Label(name=""bug"")]","Method which adds automatic no's for unanswered days does so by looking at the difference in days between the DAY_OF_YEAR of the last launch and DAY_OF_YEAR year of the current day, and adds a day for every day of that difference.

This code needs a minor fix for the case when the new year hits.
