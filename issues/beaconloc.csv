While developing your application's views you might be specifying attributes in a view's artefact that are not necessary due to the nature of its parent. In this PR, those attributes were replaced by a comment.

I have made a previous validation of the changes and they seem correct.
Unfortunately, this tool is not able keep the original whitespace of the files, so comparison without ignoring whitespace might be confusing.

This device rotates the bluetooth mac address every X minutes.

It seems that the app uses the bluetooth mac address as a key to identify the beacon.
This means that when the mac address changes the actions are not triggering anymore. The app thinks that it is a new device.

If I perform a new scan, I find my beacon there but with a new mac address.
When I tap on the beacon it is added to the list as a different beacon.

Maybe this should be changed. The UUID should be the only key that identifies the device.
I will try to take a screenshot and add it here to make it more clear.
