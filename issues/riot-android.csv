vector-im/riot-android,open,[Proposition] Small updates to device verification screen,[],"Hi there, Riot people,
I was adding a new device to my Matrix account and found some of the messages to be a bit jarring.

Rest assured, I do know that 
> In the future this verification process will be more sophisticated
but in the meantime, I'd like to propose two small changes to the current screen.

### Monospace
First, on the screen that actually displays one's key fingerprint (Verify Device) (` <string name=""encryption_information_verify_device"">Verify device</string>`), the key fingerprint should be displayed in monospace font, as it is in riot-web. That would help for consistency and for the very unlikely probability of an attacker that manages to generate a fake key which happens to switch a 'l' for a 'I', for instance, which is currently extremely hard to spot. Ideally, this fingerprint could be represented by something more visually memorable, such as what [OpenSSH introduced a while ago](https://pthree.org/2013/05/30/openssh-keys-and-the-drunken-bishop/), but everything in due course…

### Scary text
Next, I suggest replacing the text that comes up:
>To verify that this device can be trusted, please contact its owner using some other means (e.g. in person or a phone call) and ask them whether the key they see in their User Settings for this device matches the key below:

Which owner? Aren't I supposed to be the owner? Should I be worried I'm giving my private conversations away to someone else I didn't even know existed? Should I be scared? What's this weird Riot business my friend wants me to install anyway? etc.

I suggest:
> A new device has connected to your account and is requesting the secret keys needed to join your private conversations from this device. To verify that this new device can be trusted, please verify whether the string of characters you see in the new device's User Settings (called the key's fingerprint) matches this string below:

Wording for crypto usability is always tricky, so please don't hesitate to suggest improvements to this attempt.

In the meantime, I'll prepare a PR for the updated text.

Android notifications now perpetually shows a notification, that I cannot swipe away, ""Listening for events"".

I suspect this is due to recent notification sync changes, as disabling the ""Enable background sync"" setting clears the notification.

It seems to me that we shouldn't even have the option of ""Enabling background sync"", because if you're using Riot, why on earth would you want to turn this off? Why would you want to NOT get notified about things if you're using something like this? Turning it off completely defeats the point of having the app at all. If you didn't want to get notifications at all from it, you probably would use the ""exit"" feature, or force stop the app.

Now, I understand there are new hurdles that are being worked through, Namely Android P and such not showing notifications at all. And I hope this is an improvement over that. But as it is, the permanent notification for me (I'm on Android 7.0) is IMO a regression.

I think Riot notifications are really good, and the power efficiency is awesome. But we're almost at the point of notifications being reliable on all current Android versions, but this permanent notification thing is silly.

Still, this gives Google information about the social graph of users. [...]

Environment: Android 8.1, Riot 0.8.18 from Google play"
vector-im/riot-android,open,Fix end-to-end encryption,[],"### Fix the encoding to base10:

I ran some [tests regarding fingerprint read time](https://gist.github.com/maqp/90a64e9649764b21234ce90367fc7971) and discovered that interestingly, flawless use of NATO alphabet makes Riot's fingerprint verification ~0.5s faster as Signal's base10 fingerprint verification. However, very few people are familiar with such schemes, so verification over an authenticated channel is much slower in practice. Just spelling the letters took about 39 seconds, using a lookup-table to reduce errors slows verification down significantly.

Also, in practice it only took 23 seconds to read the Base10 fingerprint in Signal, that's half the time, and since numbers have represented things like prices, number of enemy troops, language has evolved to make numbers distinct from one another, so no lookup table is needed.  They are also universal. E.g. AFAIK the Japanese language does not have capital letters so base64 requires communicating the values in foreign alphabet.

---

### Combine the fingerprints:

Also, since Riot isn't combining fingerprints like Signal does, you're going to have to spend 40 seconds of your life listening to your friend playing the employee of a cold war numbers station, and that's assuming they only have one device, 40 seconds extra for every additional device.

It's highly unlikely the authenticated channel is also under MITM by e.g. an advanced AI pretending to be each party. 60 digits is good value: If each party reads 30 digits from the mess, that's still log2(10^30) = 100 bits of security per direction.

Considering the ease of this I think it's weird the ~same amount of time has been spent to add label ""In future this process will be more sophisticated"". The longer you wait, the more Matrix clients there will be who use Base64 and the harder it will be to reach consensus about switching to usable fingerprints.

---

### Put the user's fingerprint next to contact's fingerprint:

Having to navigate from contact's fingerprints to system settings to view personal fingerprint is horrible: it takes approximately 12 seconds to do that. If you were the unfortunate one who had to do that first, returning from system settings back to fingerprint takes additional ~10 seconds.

---

### End-to-end encryption has useless warnings and is unnecessarily disabled by default

Opportunistic end-to-end encryption is the best the application can do right now, and that best effort should definitely be the default behavior. Normal users get scared when they get warnings like ""E2EE is in beta and it might be dangerous"" or ""E2EE can not be disabled once enabled"". There are no situations where the users, knowing the E2EE is potentially flawed decide to not use E2EE because it's safer that way. Flawed E2EE isn't less secure than TLS because E2EE always transits through the TLS. Users who are currently self-censoring themselves because they know to wait until E2EE is out of beta, will also do that when E2EE is on by default, but when it gives a non-blocking warning about being in beta.

In a way, it's good that the non-E2EE messages are advertised as ""unencrypted"". That way users who desire end-to-end encryption don't place unnecessary trust on TLS and server. However, it might deter users who to less secure applications where there exists misdirection, e.g. Telegram's ""Cloud encryption"" that claims to protect messages on server. TLS and private server in trustworthy circles is much better against data mining threat model and even incrementally better against state adversaries threat model, than service with centralized servers and TLS."

For interacting with a set of people with whom you already have existing relationships (co-membership in rooms), it really should be trivial to send a quick message to multiple recipients, without having to set up a new room, and inviting them.

Example: if Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, and Emily are in a room together, and especially if I have 5 direct chats open with each one of them, it should be really easy to send a quick message to e.g. Alice and Dave only saying e.g. ""new zoom link"", or ""we'll wait inside"".

Maybe it's as easy as letting a message be sent to multiple rooms?

1. Full close Riot (swipe it from ""select app"" mode)

boolean isCallSupported = mRoom.canPerformCall() && mSession.isVoipCallSupported();
```
checks whether calling is supported and only then creates the call button. This causes the webrtc library to load eagerly.

If the logic is changed such that the call button is always shown, and the call feasibility check happens after the user presses the button, then it will help reduce the footprint in those cases where the user doesn't use this feature.

Heap snapshots or some other debugging tool could be used to check whether such simple changes help the run-time footprint. (There might be other instances where the library load gets triggered; I am not very familiar with the code.)"

If you highlight a message and then send a message while the other one is highlighted, it will send the message as a reply. I propose that the reply feature be moved to the context menu for the mobile apps. This would make the mobile clients work the same way as the web client as well, reducing the delta between the UX on the different clients. A similar thing I noticed was that the redact feature completely hides the message on android and ios but leaves a placeholder on the web client.

- When users do tap on message, most of them don't see that placeholder text in bottom field is changed
- If message is already typed, there are nothing changed.

So, most of users don't see implemented `Reply` feature and don't use it, before any other improved users show it.

As solution, we can add `Reply` item into 3-dot popup menu on message, that shows popup with description how to do this quickly."

Synapse branch: `matthew/lazy_load_messages_api`

Tasks below represent the cookbook used on iOS (https://github.com/vector-im/riot-ios/issues/1931). It may need some adaptation for Android:

- [ ] Local lazy loading (@bmarty) 
    - [ ] SDK: Make [MXRoom liveTimeline:] async
         - [ ] MXStore: Load MXRoomState asynchronously
         - [ ] MXStore: no more preload room states at startup
    - [ ] Use MXRoomSummary instead of MXRoom.state as much as possible
    - [ ] Riot: Make it build and run
- [ ] SDK: Decouple room members from MXRoomState:
    - [x] MXRoomState.displayName is obsolete now and make an heavy requirements on room members. Use MXRoomSummary.name everywhere.
    - [x] Create a MXRoomMembers object, property of MXRoomState, it will contain already lazy-loaded room members. This is list is enough to render the current timelime
    - [x] Get the full list of room members from a separate API (` -(MXRoomMembers*)[MXRoom members:]`)
        - [x] Make its access async (its methods could be async later)
        - [x] Make its access trigger a /members request if needed
    - [ ] (Have a separate storage for them)
- [ ] SDK: Have a MXSession.syncFilterId property
    - [ ] implement filters
        - [x] Create class models for filters
        - [x] create a factory to build a lazy-load filter
        - [x] Implement CS API to create filter
        - [x] Store them locally
        - [ ] write tests
    - [ ] Use them
        - [ ] `[MXSession start:]` -> `[MXSession startWithSyncFilter:]` and `[MXSession startWithSyncFilteId:]`
       - [x] store the `MXSession.syncFilterId`
       - [ ] have `MXSession.syncWithLazyLoadOfRoomMembers`
       - [x] manage fallback if the server does not support lazy-loading
- [ ] SDK: Manage new summary API (https://docs.google.com/document/d/11i14UI1cUz-OJ0knD5BFu7fmT6Fo327zvMYqfSAR7xs/edit#heading=h.qif6pkqyjgzn)
    - [x] members count
    - [x] compute fallback i18ned display name
- [x] SDK: Use a LL filter in /messages
     - [x] pass the filter according to `MXSession.syncWithLazyLoadOfRoomMembers` value
     - [x] process new `state` field in the response
- [x] SDK: Use a LL filter in /context
- [ ] SDK: Use new `at` params in` /members` 
     - [ ] Update the CS API
     - [ ] Manage race contions with /members: js does [that](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/62333b3e2c01c84257469cb81f6c9a2780e51c91), ios [that](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/pull/553) as discussed [here](https://matrix.to/#/!DdJkzRliezrwpNebLk:matrix.org/$153494717911304wGuhN:matrix.org)
- [x] /versions
     - [x] expose it in the SDK
     - [x] with `""unstable_features"": {""m.lazy_load_members"": true}`
- [ ] Riot: Check search display. The code must use `profile_info`
- [x] Riot: Add a setting in LABS to enable the feature
    - [x] Riot: Fallback to no LL if the user HS does not support it (/versions unstable_features above)
    - [ ]  Enable it by default. Reset it to enabled for new login/registration
- [x] Riot: Make sure read-receipts are correctly displayed
- [ ] Room status: joined/invited
    - [x] Store this information regarding the room position in sync return, instead of looking for user membership value (RoomMember of current user is not always known with LL). 
    - [ ] Force a clear cache for next installation
- [ ] Tests
    - [x] Write lazy-loading tests and regression tests 
    - [x] Make them pass

New point:
- [x] reset the boolean to fetch again a /members request in case of a room gap detection during sync
- [ ] use a limit of 30 in the LL filter"

- click 'start chat'
- type 'isobelle.mtp' (a test user with whom I already have many chats/shared rooms) into the 'User ID, Name or email' search box
- get a spinner that spins forever
- click on the search button in the bottom right
    - this stops the search?
- click on Invite by ID (which doesn't look like a button)
- type in a full mxid and get suggested a random handful of unrelated users, even if the mxid is an exact match
    - or get a different handful of users
    - or get nothing
- click INVITE
- get a screen which tells me Isobelle McTestphone has been offline for over a year
- click 'start new chat'

vector-im/riot-android,closed,Big UI Bug in Farsi or any other RTL layout,"[Label(name=""RTL"")]","Riot-Android version 0.8.10 (G-b139)
Android version 7.1.2

If I set riot to farsi, the layout becomes RTL.  First problem is that the textbox is unusable.  There's nowhere to click to bring up a keyboard and start entering text.  And the thing is like 10x taller than it should be lol

Next problem, messages displayed in unencrypted rooms look funny with bizarre indentation.

Then, it gets even worse in encrypted rooms because all messages just come up blank, and even one-line messages suddenly occupy a screen and a half worth of space (and again this is without actually showing any content).

It's worth noting that farsi language on miniVector keeps the LTR layout and works fine.  In truth, I'd prefer a RTL layout with farsi, but if it makes things more workable/practical/maintainable, do like miniVector and make things LTR.  The layout direction isn't so important to me, much more important to have it work.

See attached photo for what an unencrypted room looks like, and attached video for what an encrypted room looks like.

3. See link in confirmation email, tap on it
4. See the successful confirmation page in Google Chrome
5. Return to Riot and see it load right from the splash screen, any confirmation state lost

On the second try, I tried to [lock][1] the Riot app in Overview. Then step 5 looks slightly differently: I return right to the settings screen, only the confirmation dialog itself disappears.

Losing user input like that is extremely bad UX. I think that, together with #570, this means the confirmation state should be saved inside the Riot app in a more persistent manner, even if there is no way to propagate it to other clients.

We opened Riot on her old Android device, and it showed the key sharing dialog with the options to verify the device, ignore the request or send the keys without verifying.

I chose to verify the device and did so in the upcoming dialog.

However, after doing that, I was sent back to the original key sharing dialog; it seemed nothing had happened.

I'm not sure anymore if, in the background, Riot Android actually sent the keys or if I had to choose to send them without verification first, but the actual key share worked.

Riot was working well before either, on previous version. I tried to uninstall and install again, did not help.

Please note: it is only login screen which refuses to work, when you upgrade an app and you are still logged in, riot still works.

After a conversation with @krombel on matrix, I have identified that these are ssl ciphers I use, with nginx's defaults ciphers login works. But it does not solve the problem, as I want to keep my server safe and use the ciphers I identify as safe.

After another conversation with other friends I decided that there is no particular reasons to specify ciphers in new versions of nginx as generally SSL handling was improved and old bugs gone. So I am closing the issue, I hope keeping it in archives might help someone with similar problems.

So long and full of complex stuff. Which is something we must avoid for regular users, since they are not that into software and want things as simple and clear as possible. I propose to follow a different schema:

Right now:

---------------------------------

**User settings**

Profile picture
Display name
Change password
Email
...

**Local contacts**
Phonebook country


**User interface**
{Lots of buttons}

**Home display**
{...}

**Flair** 
{There's literally nothing here}

**Background notification**
{...}

**Labs**
{...}

#**Ignored users**
{...}

**Cryptography**
{...}

**Devices**
{...}

**Advanced**
{...}

**Analytics**
{...}

**Other**
{...}

**Deactivate account**
Deactivate account


The way I propose:

---------------------------------

**User settings** *(including account deactivation and ""phonebook country"" and maybe ""Advanced"" (maybe renamed ""Info about your connection""))*

**User interface**

**Home display**

**Background notification**

**Advanced settings** (and inside there's these menus, but I agree if you want to show them like they're right now (as far as they're inside ""Advanced settings"")) 
- **Labs**
- **Cryptography**
- **Devices**
- **Analytics** 

**Other**

--------------

 It works by clicking the name of the setting menu to access to all the configuration. So, to change any **User Interface** configuration I would need to open the menu, and click on **User Interface** so I can see all these settings (the bunch of buttons I named above). Some good examples of how this works are *AndStatus* and *Slide for Reddit*.

This way, the user has more time to discover the menu without being so impressed about all of these configurations s/he doesn't know about. Fediverse is already frightening, so I think keeping things simple and clean would help a lot. And it's aesthetically way better IMO.

Also, including a searcher in the upper bar would be a nice feature as well. "

Hey everyone, I was reading up the various posts by vector on medium, when I came across some links to rooms. On clicking them, it opens the link in web browser where riot-web notifies that it isn't supported on mobile web and that the app must be installed, even though it is already installed. On clicking install, it takes you to the play store.

There should be some way such that one can chat with another person directly by just sending his matrix username. 

Edit:
I later found out that the links made with matrix.to do work, however, it would be much better if just Riot links also directly open in Riot, which don't as of now."
vector-im/riot-android,open,Tapping grouped membership messages is confusing,[],"Generally, tapping on a message in the client selects that message, meaning that all other messages are shaded grey. Membership messages in rooms are grouped together and collapsed by default. But the behaviour of these (collapsed) groups is awfully confusing:

- Clicking on the list of avatars or on ‘expand’ label expands the group;
- Clicking on the ‘X membership changes’ label selects the whole group, but leaves you unable to do anything with it;
- Once the group is selected, expanding it by tapping on the first line still works, but upon expansion, _everything_ but the ‘collapse’ label is shaded gray (?!..).

Given that nothing useful can be done after selecting group of membership messages and that the behaviour is this confusing, I think selecting a group shouldn’t be possible at all; rather tapping anywhere on one should expand it."

Until the new build is released, those changes are only available on the snapshot.

The emojis used are the ones from emoji-one for personal reasons (those were the ones I liked the most); but it can be changed easily modifying the dependency.

For more discussion about the need for built-in emoji support, refer to #819 

I tried to follow the contribution guides; but I may have missed something. In that case, I'd appreciate some comments and I'll try to fix whatever problem there may be.

#### Expected behavior
Riot.im is  an open-source project which is a simple and elegant collaboration environment which gathers  all the  different conversations and app integrations into one single app, it used mostly  for chatting and communicating with anyone around world.        
It is a free software and comes with cool features like attaching file that is sending photos, audios and videos etc.         
With this application on can transfer images to anyone and there is no limit to that. 


#### Actual behavior
But yet when I try sending more than one image it crashes and takes me back to home.
Sometimes while I try sending more than one image it tries loading and the next thing the app crashes and takes me back to my launcher.   
There is a bug which prevents more than 1 image to be sent. 

#### How to reproduce
* Download the riot.im app from Google Play Store 
* sign up
* Try starting a conversation 
* Try sending an image
* It would be successful 
* Try marking more than one image and send it 
* It would crash the app and the application would fluctuate.

vector-im/riot-android,open,Sync behaviour in unreliable internet is flaky,[],"When moving from 3G to WiFi, or when on an intermittent internet connection, Riot frequently gets stuck syncing (i.e. the neverending progressbar indicating a sync is shown), and doesn't get unstuck, despite improvements in internet connection, unless the app is restarted. (After a restart, the sync works fine, and app operation continues as normal.) Notably, the ""connection interrupted"" banner does *not* appear when the app gets stuck syncing. (In fact, it hardly gets shown at all...)

Probably related to matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk#108 - the issue is simply that the app isn't recognizing failed syncs, and instead ends up stuck after a sync fails due to connection issues. Adding some sort of listener for system network state changes, like K-9 Mail does, might also help matters - the app could detect a change in network and restart any in-flight syncs, similar to how Chrome for Android fails any requests that are inflight when network state changes.

For the record, this behaviour is persistently the worst issue I currently suffer with riot-android - I often find myself force-quitting the app several times daily, due to my somewhat flaky internet connection."

vector-im/riot-android,open,Incompatible SDK API use which may cause crash to your APP,"[Label(name=""P2""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","Hi riot-android Developers,
I develop a tool to detect incompatible SDK API use in android application. Today I use my tool to check riot-android downloaded from F-Droid. My tool report many bugs. Although I believe most of them are real bugs, I cannot be 100% sure because I am not very familiar with Android developing. So
please help to check it, it must be very helpful to your APP.

The attachment below is the bug report that my tool give. please help to double check!
I also really hope to get your feedback.
thank you!

**[Supplementary explanation]**
There are totally two type of bug in the report. The first one is like this: ""API called in method not in [list]"", the list here are sdk levels, it means your app run under these SDK version can not call API because no such API in these sdk levels.
Type two is like ""API called in method no living level"", it means your application can never reach this API
use, so if these API uses are not in external library, you can remove it from your own code.

APIs or methods in our report are given in signature format like ""<declaringType: returnType methodName(paramTypeList)>"".

And finally, the reachable path is actually one possible call stack. it is always start from dummyMainMethod which is created by our tool. So you should read it from bottom to top.

Yes, many of these bugs seem to be in third-library codes. But it do cause problems in your app. Some third-library API say that they can only be run at specific SDK Level by using ""@targetapi(Build.VERSION_CODES.N)"", however, Application codes tend to ignore this warning.

This happened on version 0.8.1 from F-droid and reproduce 100% of the time for those rooms.
Web client can access those histories without any issue.


PS: I manually censored handles and one custom URL in logs. For an unknown reasong, Riot complain about invalid avatar URLs for contacts I don't even know and never was involved with.
And to gather those logs I only opened Riot, did the steps to reproduce the crash into history and that's all. That's kinda strange."
vector-im/riot-android,open,no read marker resend when failed,"[Label(name=""P2""), Label(name=""bug"")]",I was in conditions of very bad networking (unstable 2g) and read some rooms. This rooms are now appearing as unread (with the exact count I saw before reading that) but when I have a look at them they are unread again. The room gets then marked as read in app but only until the next opening of the app => I assume the read marker is not updated server side even when I now are reading with better network conditions. I will submit a rageshake with referencing this issue

Interestingly, the screenshots I take of Riot are squashed vertically, which could be related to the issue. No other application produces squashed screenshots in this manner.

* The main one, started by touching the circled `+` icon, to the right of the `N/M active members` element. This screen contains a text input area on the top saying `User ID, Name or email`.
* The secondary `Invite by ID` screen, accessible from the main one.

It is not clear why both of these mention the ""User ID"" and in what way they differ: when should a user use one and when the other?

The scenario in which this came up is the following:

* There are two rooms, `P` and `Q`.
* There are two users, `A` and `B`, both registered on this HS.
* User `A` is in both `P` and `Q`, but user `B` is only in `Q`.
* User `A` wanted to invite `B` to `P`.

User `A` then complained to me that entering `B`'s user ID in the text input area on the main invite screen didn't allow him to invite user `B` to the room nor did it acknowledge his existence in any way. He did not notice the `Invite by ID` clickable element.

What is the reasoning behind the separation of these two screens? Could they be merged?

If it's relevant, this is on a home server we are running, not matrix.org. The client in question is Riot Android version 0.8.1."

When the [background sync](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android/blob/e0e703d09a8b330d2779e75485c0ad0181d7452a/docs/notifications.md#background-sync-disabled) setting is disabled, Riot asks Sygnal to send matrix events content to GCM so that Riot can directly display detailed notifications from the GCM notification payload.

This is efficient for the battery and the network usage but this is a privacy concern. 
This is even a privacy issue because the app does not inform end users about that (see #2044) and what is behind this setting.

There are 2 approaches to fix this:
- never send content to GCM
When the setting is disabled, the app must not ask Sygnal to send event content to GCM. The user will see less detailed notifications like `X new messages in RoomY`.
- add another setting when *background sync* is disabled: `""Keep full detailed notifications""` with a subtitle `""This requires to send non encrypted message content through Google services servers""`.

If this is true, then the UI needs much more clarity regarding the following:

1. What does ""background sync"" do when enabled?
2. Is this setting only applicable when the application is not-in-the-foreground?
3. What happens when this setting is disabled? Does it just disable the functionality in (1) or it also enables a different type of functionality?
4. Does this setting affect the number of third-parties involved? If third-parties are involved because of this setting, then I would like to see a verbose description for the setting.

This also switches the 'caller notifications' to be set as un-swipable using flags, rather than using them as the foreground service (which is hacky, in my opinion). As a side effect of this, the forgeround service notification will still be visible when notifications come in (which is in line with other apps that use this behavior, I think).

#### Expected behavior
On the Chat-Rooms on the Riot-Chat App, the ""join room"" option on the preview-room is to include a user into the selected room.

#### Actual behavior
Recently, the recent version of the riot-chat app is faulty with a slight problem in entering a chat-room on the app. When using the app, it is found that after clicking on the room, a preview of the room is displayed with two options given which are ""join room""  and ""cancel as shown in the diagram below. 

![Screenshot_20180211-150349.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1518363267/ervnnigy8qxvoimjwqhp.png)
When clicking on the ""join room"" option, the app after loading, redirects me to the select room option without logging me into the group.

#### How to reproduce
• Download the Riot Chat app from the Google playstore if you are a new user or you don't have the app (If you have the app already, skip this step).
• Log in to the app.
• Select a room you would like to join on the select Room section. 
• When the Preview of the Room is displayed, click on join Room. (Bug Found)

I installed Lineage OS 14.1 on a Samsung Galaxy S2 Mini yesterday including google apps. After installing Riot.im (and trying to recover with Titanium Backup) I noticed that E2E was turned off. So I enabled E2E and Riot crashed. Now whenever I try to open Riot.im it keeps crashing.

You can find device_info and logcat output here: https://gist.github.com/nagua/deef1f2733c6335715ed75345ced5a0e

The relevant crash info seems to be here:

Better battery stats reports my processor never goes to sleep and is awake 100% of the time.  Under the sensors tab of better battery stats I can see that riot is accessing the accelerometer 100% of the time.

For example, `public_room_nb_users` has correct plural treatment with `getQuantityString` and `R.plurals.ID`.

These are the affected strings till now:

- `membership_changes                                                `
- `room_header_active_members                                        `
- `room_title_members/room_title_one_member                          `
- `room_new_message_notification/room_new_messages_notification      `
- `room_displayname_more_than_two_members                            `
- `directory_search_room/directory_search_rooms                      `
- `directory_search_room_for/directory_search_rooms_for              `

- `active_widgets                                                    `
- `notification_unread_notified_messages_in_room                     `

and this last one will require splitting and making **each part of the 3 parts** translatable, that is:

- `%1$d unread notified messages`
- `%1$d rooms`
- `%1$s in %2$s`

I actually tried to fix them, but some of them are actually `string`s and not `int`s, which then I stopped as my Java knowledge is below zero :)


And lastly there is this string: `R.String.and`, which is used to join multiple names like so: foo, foo and foo.
Please make each segmented part translatable: `%1$s, %2$s`, and the second placeholder will be replaced by the same string, or, in case we're at the before last one, with `%1$s and %2$s.`. Yes it's a hassle but this will ensure no one has problems with it.

When I have a conference call via Linux and Web, all people involved join the same voice chat (Jitsi widget disabled in this case). We can all hear each other just fine.

When I then log onto my Android Riot app, join the same channel, and try to join voice only, it then adds the Jitsi widget (without asking), and starts a Jitsi conference, instead of joining the existing voice conference (is it freeswitch? I'm not sure).

This effectively leads to fragmentation of voice conferencing, in that two simultaneous voice conferences are existing for the same channel, and are not bridged whatsoever (they cannot hear each other).

Furthermore the Android app, most of the time, by default starts a VIDEO conference when VOICE was tapped on. This is really annoying, and not working as intended.

3. Turn off Wifi (hotspot).
4. Wait until the call will end by itself.
5. Turn on & reconnect to the Wifi (hotspot).

I was thinking, what could add more added value to this platform, and came to some idea's and jut wanted to share, it might be useful or not.

riot /matrix it's all about communication en colaboration, so why not expand a little? make it more like a personal assistant?

- In house agenda. 
So store your agenda in the matrix server. This could lead to all kinds of cool features like adding agenda items from the client, or receive agenda messages in the client. or course this agenda should also be approachable from other traditional clients

- reminders/to do's
you could set reminders or to do's from the client and get notified

- file store
from within the app you could store files in the matrix server, and walk trough files
and you could easily share files from the file store

- Email
Yes of course we could do email from within the same client as a central point for all communication.
Matrix could act as a mail client and serve/process emails, where riot acts as a frontend.

we could create app shortcuts in the android/ios desktop screen to all these functions as a quick way to get into the right location within the app

just some idea's, shoot :)

**Out of scope for this suggestion:**
* Total data use (this is reported and logged by Android already)

  * Messaging (MiB per room per day)
  * Background data (MiB per day)
* Logging data usage
* Reporting actual cost based on network data rate

vector-im/riot-android,closed,Media previewer,[],"This is intended as a start on issue #860. I was wondering if I could receive some feedback on the way that I am implementing this. The functionality right now is the following:
- User picks a media file to share. 
- `sendMediasIntent()` will check if the file is an image.
- The intent will be send to `MediasPreviewerActivity.java`
- `MediasPreviewerActivity.java` will then get the image(s) (in this case only one image is supported) from the intent and display it.
- The user taps the `FloatingActionButton` to confirm that the right media file has been selected.
- `MediasPreviewerActivity.java` sends the intent back.
- `VectorRoomActivity.java` will call `onActivityResult()` which will in turn call `mVectorRoomMediasSender.sendMedias()` and so the image will be send.

I primarily want to expand on this by making the contain the necessary information (like a highly needed top bar) and by supporting different and multiple media files at the same time (right now just the first one will be used and the only media type that will trigger the preview is a .jpg). 

I was mainly wondering if this is the right way to go about it and if there are default things that I should implement in `MediasPreviewerAcitivity.java`. As an example, I have already implemented  checks if the application should restart or is going to splash, but there might be more."
vector-im/riot-android,closed,Go offline without signing out,"[Label(name=""P3""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""feature"")]","**User story:** I am an everyday user. I don't want to take any messages or calls right now. Later I want to launch Riot again and have it pick up where I left off (including receiving messages/notifications from while I was away), so that my user experience is seamless.

**What I tried:** I picked ""hamburger menu"" then ""sign out"". But when I launched Android Riot later, I had to enter my credentials again and I had a new Device ID, so I had to re-establish trust with my contacts and other devices. Luckily I don't have many friends.

**Proposed solution:** Make an explicit option to simply terminate the process. Separate this from the decoupling procedure (flushing credentials and device ID). This could be implemented as:

* ""Sign out"" terminates the process, ""Decouple"" performs the decoupling, or
* ""Go offline"" terminate the process, ""Sign out"" performs the decoupling (current behaviour)

**Proposed solution 2:** Have a ""Mute"" option, where the process continues to run in the background but does not alert the user when new messages/calls arrive, and doesn't do anything to indicate to the caller that the callee is available. Would also need an ""Unmute"" option.

**Workaround 1:**
* Switch off the phone
* ...not suitable if there are other things I want to do

**Workaround 2:**
* Visit Android menu
* Long hold Riot icon
* Drag Riot icon onto ""App info""
* Select ""Force stop""
* ...not suitable for an everyday user

However, using this API to set the short time interval to restart the app is not reliable and could be delayed. As stated in the [doc](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#set(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)), from API 19, 

> the trigger time passed to this method is treated as inexact: the alarm will not be delivered before this time, but may be deferred and delivered some time later

Using `setExact` after API 19 could trigger the alarm still at the desirable time specified.

at first: sorry for posting this request here in GitHub issue tracker. I'd prefer to request this in a (fommunity) forum but as far as I noticed Matrix/Riot.im don't have a forum at the moment.

My request:

Testing Riot.im on a Synapse home server (v0.23.1) with 3 users using the F-Droid App version (no GApps insatlled) we experienced notification problems for incomfing messages: sometimes there are notifications, sometimes not; sometimes not for all messages but just for one in a specific room (not for others).

What I've tried:

1. Activated autostart (so `Riot.im / Listening for events` is listed in Android notification drawer).
2. Even with activated autostart we [started the app manually after an Android reboot](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android/issues/995#issuecomment-284710682).
3. Reduced App sync time (from 600s to 60s).

My questions:

I) Are there any known bugs related to notifications with F-Droid version and no GApps installed?
II) Is it mandatory to set an identity server to receive notifications properly?
III) Are there any settings in Synapse `homeserver.yaml` to improve notification support?

If the app is not running in the foreground, it is either not ringing or it will ring with substantial delay and sometimes even beyond the caller hanging up.

I was glad that you did include autostart at boot, which I did enable hoping that the devices would then not only alway show ""Riot.im Listening for events"" but also always ring if called.

This is tested on Oneplus3, Galaxy S4 and Nexus 7 each running LineageOS 14.1-201708xx. The result does not depend on using matrix.org or my homeserver. 20 second sync request delay is set and automatic battery optimization disabled. In general, I find the Nexus 7 to be a slightly more reliable ""ringer"", but nevertheless, ring reliability/delay is too low with all devices.

While all devices have ""Beryllium"" as the notification sound and ""Orion"" as the ring tone, they do behave differenty upon being called - if they do ring: The S4 only vibrates while the Oneplus 3 and the Nexus 7 make a sound which is neither Beryllium nor Orion but rather the same ringtone that the desktop app produces.

It would be really good if this could be resolved.  Users of the F-Droid version on LineageOS are likely those who want to get themselves away from WhatsApp. To compensate for a smaller network, more functions could be a key.

That's especially visible with the perpetual loading bar at the top of the interface, or by failing messages on the login view if I disconnect myself of the application.

The problem is that when that happen, nothing tells to the user he's actually disconnected: no notification, and the bar in the notification tray is still displaying ""Listening for events"", which lead to the wong belief that application is still running perfectly normally.

By the way, when speaking about that bar in the notification tray, I would suggest to change the wording. While ""Listening for events"" can be understand by someone with network and programming notions, this is probably very hard to understand what does that mean for ""normal users""."

So idea is to integrate in Riot Android application (or maybe release as separate app) some type of Matrix bridge or bot, that can receive and send SMS directly via mobile device from native private user phone number, using Android API.

Via same way we can implement bridge to WhatsApp, Viber and other applications that don't provide API for external services, via intercepting and act on popup messages in system. Some other apps like AirDroid already can intercept and answer to SMS, Telegram and WhatsApp messages from desktop computer via Android.

Clicking it enlarges the picture wonderfully.
The Android app shows the text of the RSS-post as well, but no picture at all. In order to see it you have to leave Riot and click the link to open up another app (webbrowser, feedreader).

Example feed: http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml
Not showing pictures is even more of a problem when you create an RSS-feed from (image-)services like Instagram or Flickr (for instance via https://bridge.suumitsu.eu).
Using the RSS-bot like that offers great opportunities to integrate all kinds of services into Riot/Matrix, but not being able to see RSS-bot pictures in the Android app diminishes those oppurtunities again.

It would be great to be able to see the pictures in the Riot Android app itself, just like in the Desktop app.
Therefore it seems related to how the Android app deals with the RSS-bot, and not to the RSS-bot itself. Hence the post in this part of the github.

vector-im/riot-android,open,Suggestion for improving directory loading performance,"[Label(name=""P2""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Dear developers,

We are applying our performance diagnosis tool [PerfProbe](https://github.com/perfprobe/PerfProbe) to debug the user-experienced latency for loading a directory in Riot app and observe that loading particular directory (such as Riot or Matrix HQ) takes long time (on average around 28 seconds and sometimes as long as 66 seconds to load Riot directory in my setup). Through its system-wide profiling and tracing, PerfProbe discovers that besides server-side delay for network requests, another major source of extra delay results from the execution of Android's API call android/graphics/BitmapFactory.nativeDecodeAsset on the main thread (for example, one invoked by im/vector/activity/VectorRoomActivity.onCreate -> android/support/v7/app/AppCompatActivity.setContentView), likely due to the computation resource bottleneck for decoding some bitmaps (longer wait time for computation resource is observed when the delay for BitmapFactory.nativeDecodeAsset increases).

We localized to Riot's source code based on above diagnosis result and discovered that the delay for the API call ""BitmapFactory.nativeDecodeAsset"" may be due to loading large bitmaps (e.g., vector/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/vector_search_bg.png with size 67KB) for rendering im.vector.view.VectorOngoingConferenceCallView during the method call ""setContentView(R.layout.activity_vector_room)"" inside method ""onCreate"" of vector/src/main/java/im/vector/activity/VectorRoomActivity.java. Bitmap loading operations are usually memory-heavy and computation-intensive. 

We hope our findings can be helpful for your debugging. We are also interested in helping improving the performance of this interaction. One suggestion is to load a scaled-down version of bitmap into memory based on Android's developer guideline ([Loading Large Bitmaps Efficiently](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/load-bitmap.html)). Thank you very much for your attention and clarification!

vector-im/riot-android,open,Part of the history can be lost sometimes,"[Label(name=""P2""), Label(name=""bug"")]","I have no steps to reproduce it as it's quite random, so posting it just to gather some other confirmations if there any. So in a single week I found a couple of times that part of my timeline on the phone is missing. The last time it was about 18 minutes of conversation from 23:14 to 23:32. There were messages before and after the lost chunk and I only guessed something is wrong because some context of the conversation was missing. I checked the same room on the tablet and it was fine, the whole timeline has been present. There are several factors in play:
1. I have different accounts on the phone and tablet; the physical server that serves them is the same (VPS) though the domains are different and thus there are two synapse processes;
1. The one with the lost chunk is using a domain name delegated to a not quite good DNS server (name.com), I can't resolve it from time to time and had to put the IP to /etc/hosts on my PC. So maybe there were temporal issues in the federation, however, I checked the logs and there are federation send requests at that time so it was fine;
1. I took the phone out for some time so it should have switched from Wi-Fi to 4G and back (probably not a problem);

Still, after some time I scrolled back and the missing piece has been restored (the quicker way is to ""clear cache"" from the settings). I didn't find any errors in the logcat though. Also the same issue happened to another folk who's using a matrix.org account. Our room is also located on that unreliable domain but as I understand it that's only a name and the actual messages are posted to the homeserver and then replicated to other participating servers. So if he didn't see even the matrix.org-originated messages being on matrix.org himself there's something wrong.

As I said, if something like that happened to anybody please drop a line. The issue being that frequent is pretty critical but I'm not sure if it's common or there's something on my end. Anyway, what happens if a back paginate request fails for some reason? Does the user get some visual feedback or is it completely silent?

vector-im/riot-android,closed,Messages not marked as read anymore,"[Label(name=""P2""), Label(name=""bug"")]","On version 0.6.14, and apparently since the 0.6.13, when using simultaneously riot-web and riot-android, the messages are not marked as read by the Android client, as long as they are not read in the web client. 

If a contact send me 2 messages, I get a correct notification, I can read them in my Android, but the ""2"" icon on the contact name will stay (and also on the Riot icon). I will also always have the ""jump to first unread message"" menu, and using it will change nothing. I have tried the ""mark all as read"" menu as well, it does nothing. The only way to get these message to be considered as read by the android client is to read them again in the web client (which, by the way, also displays them as unread before reading them in it). It seems that the Android client does not sent the ""read"" notification to the server anymore ? 

I am hosting my own matrix and riot. My matrix-react-sdk version is 0.9.7. The web Riot version is 0.11.4, and the bug is reproduced on various Android 6 and 7.

This is not critical, but quite annoying, the unread messages counter can quickly increase depending on the room activity."

vector-im/riot-android,open,File upload / resume behavior sub-par on flaky connections,"[Label(name=""P3""), Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi All,

recently I’ve noticed that file upload is not quite optimal with flaky connections. One practical example: A friend’s hiking in the mountains and wants to send me ~5 photos he took the day. The internet up there is not only slow, but also flaky — i.e., it drops every now and then, more often than one’d like. What Riot / Synapse *seem* to do today is something like: let’s try to upload the chunk (one complete file) and if that fails, retry after 5/10/15 seconds again. However, since no single transfer of a ~800KByte file will succeed, all uploads will fail, presenting the user (in case of riot) with a „failed — cancel or resend“-warning.

While I also know that comparing Matrix/Riot/Synapse to other proprietary solutions, I’d like to point out that both the dreaded WhatsApp as well as XMPP/Conversations (with HTTPUpload) have succeeded to send full files in this situation, regardless of intermittent connection drops.

I had originally filed this in matrix-doc as https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/949 because i thought it was appropriate there, since both server and client would need to be touched, however i’m now moving it here as @richvdh advised — thanks!

Thanks for all your hard and great work so far ^_^.
Best,

so... prompted by the email, hilary is valiantly trying to reconnect to riot
she has the app on her phone, but can't remember her password
she clicks 'forgot password' on the app, gives her email address and new passwords, and gets the email validation by email
she follows the link, and chooses to open it in the app, which then takes her through a captcha (!) and then wedges at a spinner

This means that the user's device didn't recognise the one-time-key the sender used to establish the session. That might be due to one of several things:
* The user's device uploaded the same one-time key twice, due to https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/3868, and it was claimed by separate users.
* The user's device threw out the one-time key, due to https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/3309.
* The user's device uploaded the one-time key, and then forgot it had done so due to some storage reset?
* Possibly some other reason?

I guess the latter is more likely. It's very hard to tell from the logs, though.

(At least some of these failures seem to be the first message sent from the other side, which means it *isn't* due to Coffee's device receiving the first message, setting up the session, deleting the one time key, then forgetting the session.)"

> this is a problem with how Riot developers manage dependencies. Riot requires Matrix SDK library, which is included into their Git repo as a binary. F-Droid requires such binaries to be built from source (to make sure they aren't closed source software). F-Droid's build recipe for Riot includes instructions how to replace Matrix SDK binary with a source-built version (srclib). The problem is that Riot devs don't specify the commit they built this binary from. So, when they release a new Riot version, someone needs to figure out the version of Matrix SDK they used this time. For this reason Riot cannot be updated automatically.

I think implementing #484 would implicitly help us here, correct?

vector-im/riot-android,closed,Add a basic theme switcher,[],"Please don't merge this yet, it's still a WIP!

This PR adds a simple theme switcher to the option menu, and changes a single color (the `room_background` color is changed from white to black) to demonstrate that it works. I don't want to change more than a single color right now since that would require a lot of changes (basically, moving where colors are defined into the themes file, rather than individual components or `color.xml`.)

(In theory) the light theme should be the current default theme, while the dark theme is the light theme with a 'dark android base' (so that unstyled elements use a dark theme), and making the room background pure black.

Once this gets a :+1: from you guys (revewiing just the theme switcher itself and the structure of how the colors are going to be laid out), I'll go ahead and to implement the dark theme that is pictured below.

This is my first time ever working on an android app, so let me know if I'm doing anything that looks wrong! I'm going to try and leave a few comments on here to point out things I'm not sure about.

Inspiration and guidance were taken from both #48 and [k9 mail](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9), but I ended up writing everything that's here by myself. I'm pretty busy over the next couple of weeks, so I might be slow to respond, but I will (hopefully) eventually push this through! :smile:

vector-im/riot-android,closed,worrying privacy policy terms,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Hi, I've been looking at matrix with interest (a decentralized and encrypted messaging platform with both free software client AND server :O), but then I read [riot's privacy policy](https://riot.im/privacy) and I get worried by things like these (emphasis mine):

> When might we **disclose your information**?
> 
>   To comply with our legal obligations or to protect the interests of our users.
> 
> If we are or believe that we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data, we will do so in order to comply with any legal obligation, **the instructions or requests of a governmental authority or regulator**, including those **outside of the UK**.
> 
> We may also choose to share information when we believe it is **necessary to detect, prevent and address illegal activity** or to otherwise protect the safety of our users.
> 
> We will share information in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and any other relevant agreements; or to protect our rights or property. 
> 
> [...]
>  If VECTOR CREATIONS LIMITED is sold.
> 
> In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, **we may disclose your personal data** to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
> 
> If we or substantially **all of our assets are acquired by a third party**, personal data held by us about **our users will be one of the transferred assets**.

So a few questions:

* How does this awful privacy policy protect users' privacy?  I see it's not part of your marketing so I could be confused about this :)

* How does this privacy policy affect the matrix network?

* If I setup a matrix node, in which cases will it share (meta)data with nodes under this privacy policy?  When I talk with people with riot.im/matrix.org accounts only?  Or it will always share it? (I don't know the internal of the protocol, does it gossip data or the federation is on demand like email or jabber?)

* What about bridges to other networks such as IRC?

Thanks."

1. Some way to store logs offline in a plain text format would be very useful, so one may make backups of them, among other things. A way to disable it, and to set the storage location to the SD card would also be nice, for those concerned with space usage and writes to the internal storage.
2. Furthermore, it seems as though Riot currently does not store logs on the device at all. This is wasteful on slow or patchy connections. Even with a faster connection, there is still lag loading the backlog, which discourages looking through the history.

Surely the server does know whether the RM is above or below our current read point however, and we should actually label the ""jump to unread"" bar correctly. This could be done by the server providing an API to let clients compare the chronologicity of two event ids.

- Collapsible notifications on a per room basis
- Colours the notifications depending on if there was a bing or not
- Orders the notifications depending on if there were bings in them or not.

- Generally do this in a less hacky way

vector-im/riot-android,closed,"New direct conversations created under ""Rooms"" instead of ""People""",[],"I'm not really sure if this is a bug, or just a UX difference.

When using Riot online or on my desktop I have two distinct categories of chats:

- People
- Rooms

People are one on one conversations I have with a single user. Rooms are conversations I have with >1 users. When I initiate a one-on-one conversation on Riot web/desktop it's ""properly"" shown under the ""People"" category.

Using Riot for Android however, every new conversation is a room that's created, and it's also showing up under the ""Room"" category, especially on web/desktop.

Now I know, ""people"" category conversations are technically probably just a fancy way of saying ""this is a room with just two people in it"", but the different categorization is useful and helps sort out larger room directories.

On Android there is no such distinction at all, everything is a room. New one-on-one conversations are always created as rooms. And they show up under the ""Rooms"" category on web/desktop.

My expectation would be:

1. Conversations under the ""People"" category on web/desktop are also showing up under a ""People"" category on Android
2. Newly created conversations, initiated by the Android client, are sorted in the ""People"" category

Let me know if this makes sense, or whether that's a unique design choice the web/desktop people went after, or even whether this is a design consideration you've already made up your mind about. For me, it was too large a design disparity to not write an issue about :blush: "

vector-im/riot-android,open,Riot video and voice chat does not work on Blackberry 10 phones. Fix this and attract a wide user base of Blackberry users.,[],"Hi, I've been using RIOT for 2 months after reading various security websites praise for Riot. I installed the Android version of Riot on my Blackberry 10 phone. The BB10 operating system can run Android apps with varying degrees of success. Riot installed easily using Fdroid. Overall, it runs well and sends text messages flawlessly, however the voice and video call features do not work. 

In order to popularise Riot, I'd like to suggest that Riot developers either A) make a port of the Android app for Blackberry 10 so it can be included in Blackberry World, or B) code the Android app so that it offers full functionality on Blackberry10 phones.

Blackberry 10 users will be thrilled I believe to have access to a secure open source app like Riot. WhatsApp is abandoning BB10 in the summer of 2017. Most of the other major chat apps have also stopped supporting BB10. However, there are still many hundreds of thousands of BB10 phones that will be in use for the foreseeable future. If Riot ran properly on BB10 phones, it seems very likely that many users will switch to Riot when WhatsApp shuts off support for BB10.

Blackberry users are very security conscious and will likely be keen on adopting Riot. Many BB10 users would like to use SIGNAL, but it will not run on Blackberry 10 because it requires GooglePlayServices.

In short, ensuring that Riot runs on Blackberry 10 phones would help convert many thousands of users to Riot because it would be the only secure messenger app available for Blackberry. (Blackberry's own messenger BBM is essentially irrelevant now because they refused to make cross-platform desktop apps and took too long to develop versions for iOS and Android)"

Checked the notifications settings (on Android + rooms) which was fine, then discovered it always gave me new notifications only once I actually opened the app and kept it open.

Currently, the app does not infinitely retry to send out the message, even if the connection is up again. The user has to manually click ""retry"" to send the message.
As users often write and send a message, then put away their phone, they are not aware that the message has not been sent.

Therefore, I propose a (configurable?) automatic retry, where the application tries to send out messages again until it succeeded.

This might be implemented with an increasing timeout to avoid permanent load in small bandwidth networks and to lower battery usage."

I am developing a tool to automatically refactor Android applications with the goal of improving energy efficiency.
This pull request has the changes generated while applying the rule ""Recycle"".

Some resources (e.g., ```Cursor``` instances) should be closed when they are no longer necessary. 

I have made a previous validation of the changes and they seem correct.
Please consider them and let me know if you agree with them.

Best,
Luis

When in an unencrypted room, I'm able to receive pictures from other room members without problems.  However, when encryption is enabled in the room and someone sends a picture, after a few seconds I only get a black and white, schematic placeholder picture.  When I select it and the (barely visible) download pie completes, I only get a fully black picture with unresponsive share and download buttons, although in some very rare occasions I can actually get the picture, share and download it (the thumbnail remains schematic, though).

I've ruled out an issue in the server (I run my own) since if I also connect to the same room using ``riot-web``, I'm able to see the images without problems.  Other participants can get the pictures as expected.

Signal and Briar have similar features, so if Riot wants to appeal to their user demographics, it could be a plus. One could also look at these apps to see how they deal with receiving events in the background while the app is locked.

If implemented, it perhaps would make sense to make it configurable for how long the password unlocks the app unless it has to be entered again."

I could be wrong, but I think that the room count can be an int (instead of Integer).
This way it does not have to be null checked and can be used more safely. 
I also couldn't quite resist and did some minor refactoring where I changed code.

If this is too much of a change for this small issue, you could just do this instead:

- Typing notifications are shown like the iMessage ellipsis chat bubble, as a phantom inline message in the timeline.  To stop the timeline bouncing up and down as people start and stop typing, we debounce the timeline animation - after making room for the typing notification by scrolling up, the timeline waits N seconds (if at all?) to scroll back down again.

vector-im/riot-android,closed,End-to-end encryption UI/UX,"[Label(name=""P1""), Label(name=""design""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""feature"")]","This is a high level bug to track all the design & UI implementation dependencies for E2E crypto, to compliment the list of individual issues we've had historically.  It's also written to reflect the guide I gave at the Ribot offices this morning.  Top priority first:
- [x] Show whether room is either:
  - unencrypted (same as current UI - perhaps an grey opened padlock shown in the RoomHeader?)
  - encrypted and trusted: i.e. all devices present are verified - perhaps a green closed padlock shown in the RoomHeader?
  - encrypted and untrusted: i.e. some devices present are not verified - perhaps a yellow /!\ shown in the RoomHeader
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1783 & https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1781
  
  Untrusted messages / users / rooms are not necessarily the end of the world, so should not be a huge red flashing warning, but an advisory warning (hence the /!\ suggestion) that users could choose to ignore if they don't care about verifying who they're talking to.
- [x] Show whether received messages in an encrypted room are, per message:
  - trusted messages could have a green padlock or something in the left margin on hoverover.
  - untrusted messages could have a yellow /!\ or something in the left margin all the time.
  - unencrypted messages could have an unlocked padlock or something shown all the time in left margin.
  - blocked messages (i.e. sender blocked you from receiving them) could have a red /x\ or something in the left margin.
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1785
- [x] Toggle encryption for a room on (and off, in future)
  - Could be a toggle in RoomSettings, or perhaps the padlock icon in the RoomHeader proposed below.
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1782
- [x] Show whether users in an encrypted room's membership list are:
  - trusted: i.e. all the devices for that user have been verified (green padlock on the avatar?)
  - untrusted: i.e. some of the devices for this user are unverified or blocked (yellow /!\ on the avatar?)
  - blocked: i.e. all of the devices for this user have been blocked (red /x\ on the avatar)
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1783
- [x] Show and manage list of devices for a given user.  For each device for a user in the MemberInfo contents of RightPanel we need to show:
  - The device's name (e.g. ""https://vector.im on Chrome OSX"")
  - How trusted the device is:
    - verified: i.e. we have explicitly verified this device belongs to the human we think it should: green padlock?
  - unverified: i.e. we have not verified this device yet: yellow /!\? padlock with a question mark? yellow /?\?
  - blocked: i.e. we have explicitly blocked this device from receiving our messages as we do not trust it: red /x\ ?
  - A UI control for explicitly marking the device as verified, unverified, blocked, or unblocked.
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1784
- [x] UI for sending messages in an encrypted room
  - If someone adds an unverified device to a room, or changes the encryption settings of the room, we should block the UI with a modal dialog when the user hits 'send' on a message to warn the user and force them to review the settings/devices before hitting send again.
  - The warning modal only triggers the first time we send a message after unverified devices are added to a room (including first use), to avoid being too nagging.
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1786
- [x] UI for verifying someone else's device.  When the user asks to verify someone's device (e.g. using the UI control mentioned on the previous line), we need to show some UI that guides the user through proving that the device is owned by that user.
  - As a first cut, this could just be a modal dialog that displays the hexadecimal fingerprint of the device (e.g. 4EB9 F820 5F2A 19E2) and prompts the user to compare this fingerprint with the other user ""out-of-band"" (e.g. over a phone call) to verify they match.
  - As a later cut (requires more backend work), we could show a modal dialog that prompts the user to enter a passphrase in order to verify the remote device.  The passphrase (e.g. ""horse pink plaster razor"" would be told to the verifying user ""out of band"".
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1788
- [ ] Show UI for verifying your own device with someone else.
  - If someone asks you to verify your device (e.g. you get a phone call from them saying 'Hey, can you confirm that your device is really you?'), the user should go to MemberInfo for the user who is calling them, and hit a ""Verify myself"" button.
  - As a first cut, this would just show them a modal dialogbox with their hexadecimal fingerprint that they can then confirm with the other user.
  - As a second cut (requires the same backend  work), we could show a passphrase (e.g. ""horse pink plaster razor"") that they can read out to the other user.
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1789
- [x] Show and manage list of our own devices.  For each of our devices, in UserSettings, we need to show:
  - The device unique ID (just to help the user disambiguate devices with the same name)
  - The device's name
  - Where/When that device was last seen (to help track whether your devices have been stolen, which ones are active, and to order the list)
  - The ability to delete a device.
  - https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1787

deprioritised:
- Differentiate between rooms with ""burn after reading"" crypto and ""replay history"" crypto
  - We currently implement two different crypto algorithms for rooms: ""Olm"" and ""Megolm"".  Olm lets messages only be downloaded and decrypted once per device; Megolm lets messages be re-downloaded multiple times and generally behave like normal Matrix.
  - When configuring encryption, some option to select the ""burn after reading"" semantics for a room (and somehow represent that in the crypto settings on the UI) would be useful.
  - This is lowest priority.

additionnaly you can invite other contacts to the private discussion or
you can also do create a room as in the matrix/vector way.

vector-im/riot-android,open,VoIP Checklist,"[Label(name=""P1""), Label(name=""feature"")]","Here's my notes on building a comprehensive VoIP UX (inherited from ye olde TNG days):

P0:
- [x] Ensure ""early hangup"" works from both caller & callee side
- [x] Ensure ""late hangup"" works from both caller & callee side (i.e. clearing the call after being answered)
- [x] Ensure multiple consecutive calls work after the various different termination scenarios
- [x] Ensure that termination reasons are correctly displayed in the UI (e.g. ""answered elsewhere"", ""lost media"", ""lost signalling"", ""cancelled"", ""hung up"", ""other error"")
  answered elsewhere : a toast is displayed.
- [x] Ensure inbound calls are picked up when the app is launched from cold
- [x] Ensure inbound calls are picked up when the app is foregrounded after being backgrounded
- [x] Ensure that multiple devices ring simultaneously for inbound calls
- [x] Ensure that if the call is answered on another device, we tell the user what the error was
- [x] Ensure that if the call is rejected by another device, we tell the user that's what happened
- [x] Ensure that devices which are busy on other calls do not cause inbound calls to be globally rejected (see vector-im/vector-web#1964)
- [ ] Ensure that we don't interact badly with rate limiting (i.e. we correctly retry VoIP signalling like m.call.candidates if we get a 429 'too many requests' response back)
- [ ] Ensure that we don't try to re-answer stale m.call.invite events (`m.call.invite` and `m.call.hangup` matching the same `call_id` in the same sync resp, so first `m.call.invite` must be discarded)
- [x] Ensure 1:1 call is made for 1:1 joined members (invited or banned users do not count)

P1:
- [x] Need local voice mute button
- [x] Need local video mute button
- [x] Need ability to flip between rear & front facing camera
- [x] Need ability to toggle speakerphone on & off
- [x] When on video call, default to speakerphone being on.
- [x] When on voice call, default to speakerphone being off.
- [ ] Ensure that the right microphone is used when on speakerphone (some handsets have a dedicated microphone used when on speakerphone to avoid feedback)
- [x] When a video call (and not a voice call) is foregrounded, wedge the backlight on.
- [x] When a voice call (and not a video call) is foregrounded and not on speakerphone, turn the backlight off when the proximity sensor fires (i.e. the phone is brought to the ear).
- [ ] When physical headset is plugged in, switch to headset.
- [ ] Only pause background music when actually on a call
- [ ] Play 'ringtone' and vibrate when the callee receives a call.
- [ ] Ensure ""glare"" is handled gracefully if caller & callee try to call each other at the same time.  Some tiebreaker (e.g. the user with the lexographically lower user ID) should assume the role of caller and the call should proceed.
- [ ] Ensure there is no echo when on speakerphone (as heard by the remote device from a different room)
- [ ] Ensure lipsync is correct
- [ ] Ensure bandwidth/framerate/latency recovers out of going out of reception or being on a bad network
- [ ] Ensure trickle ICE works
- [ ] Ensure TURN works over UDP
- [ ] Ensure TURN works over TCP (port 3478)
- [ ] Ensure TURN works over TCP+SSL (port 443)
- [ ] Ensure permission prompts for microphone and camera are handled well on first use and don't disrupt the call setup (especially if the call setup is happening in the background)
- [ ] Ensure if user cancels permissions for microphone and camera the call still continues as well as it can (and that the user has the ability to easily uncancel the permissions in future)

P2:
- [ ] Ensure that incoming GSM calls put the call on hold
- [ ] Ensure that ongoing calls are taken off hold when the app is subsequently resumed
- [ ] Need indicator to say whether the remote user is currently on hold (especially if this is due to them receiving a GSM call)
- [ ] Need indicator to say whether the remote user has muted voice or video (rather than the call crapping out)
- [ ] Need network quality warning, so that if the call quality is having problems the user understand it's the network's fault rather than the app's fault.
- [ ] Set default audio playback volume (or warn if it is at zero), otherwise users think there's audio and don't realise they have to turn up the volume control.
- [ ] Play 'pushing' tone when waiting for the other user to 'respond to your push' (i.e. return an m.call.ringing or whatever)
- [ ] Play 'ring back tone' when the other user's client(s) is actually ringing.  (This is different to a ringtone played for inbound calls!)
- [ ] Show inbound call screen on lockscreen if at all possible.
- [ ] Ensure ""back to app"" works and video & audio is still captured and audio is still played back when the app is foregrounded but the call UI is backgrounded
- [ ] Ensure that both voice and video calls continue when the app is backgrounded (although the OS will typically disables video capture)
- [ ] Ensure that the phone can be locked and screen turned off (e.g. by pressing power button on iOS) whilst on a call and still have audio continue.
- [ ] Ensure that after N minutes of the phone being locked and screen turned off the call continues and isn't cancelled as a powersaving measure.

P3:
- [ ] Prompt to optionally degrade to voip if insufficient network to support video
- [ ] After N seconds of total media failure, abort call and give option to call back
- [x] _Don't_ need an explicit ""hold"" button though as we don't have an explicit line 1/line 2 thing going on (yet) other than when something happens to the call (e.g. GSM interruption) to interrupt voice and video capture.
- [ ] Ensure that other interruptions to the call (e.g. backgrounding it and capturing voice or video with another app) put the call on hold.
- [ ] Ensure that secondary noise-cancelling microphones are correctly used for both speakerphone and non-speakerphone calls. (this is probably best done by googling to see if we're using the right API)
- [ ] Support bluetooth headset
- [ ] Ensure ""back to app"" button works when an outbound call is being setup (i.e. the call media sets up properly despite connecting in the background)
- [ ] Ensure backgrounded calls work when the app is backgrounded during call setup
- [ ] Ensure that if the OS disables video capture due to backgrounding, the mute is propagated to the receiver
- [ ] Ensure there is no echo when switching speakerphone on and off (may require explicitly telling the VoIP stack when this happens so it knows to recalibrate the echo cancellation filter)
- [ ] Ensure ICE candidate discovery is not too aggressive

In future:
- [x] Support group calling as per vector-web.
- [ ] Support upgrading voip to video call
- [ ] Support downgrading video to voip call
- [ ] Support upgrading voip/video call to conference
- [ ] Support downgrading voip/video call from conference
- [ ] Support receiving WebRTC screenshare screens
- [ ] Ensure calls survive switching networks
- [ ] Ensure video is played in a thumbnail when ""back to app"" (like youtube)
- [ ] Prompt for user feedback after calls (rate from 1-5 stars)
- [ ] Report media logs for calls (i.e. phone home with the webrtc.internals graphs, or the TNG equivalent)
- [ ] Hook SRTP DTLS fingerprints into our E2E encryption device keys(!) (for @richvdh)

vector-im/riot-android,closed,Stuck notifications issue,[],
vector-im/riot-android,closed,Heavy battery drain.,"[Label(name=""P3""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""feature"")]","Setup:

Android 5.1 (CM12.1)
GSMCore 0.2.2 from microG, as a replacement for Google play services. (https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore)
I recently switched to the microG apps/services instead of the Google play ones.
On my mobile there is a heavy battery drain by matrix. 

As long as the event-service from the vector app is not running, everything is fine.
When I receive a message, the app is woken via the GCM, and the event-service is started.
Now, for me it seems, that the event-service is used, which then keeps waking up the mobile network, causing the heavy battery drain.

Is there some kind of fallback to the notification service if there are issues with GCM?

Note: On my tablet, I don't have this issue with the same setup. But as the tablet is losing the Wifi connection sometimes during the day, I'm not sure if the two devices are comparable.

I've also reported this issue to the ""matrix-android-console"" as I'm facing the same issue there. (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console/issues/24)

The memory warning is another case : the system warns us that there is no more available memory on the device and the client is going to be killed so it seems better to restart the client to reduce its memory usage and to avoid crash.

But there are other cases in which the application restarts whereas it is not expected.

With their help, we found out that the service (events polling thread) is killed or some other required fields are not initialised (e.g active sessions list) : the client detects that something is not valid in its fields and restarts to avoid crash.

I never got such behaviour on my devices (Nexus 6 - Android M, Samsung S3 - Android 4.2.2, Zenfone 550KL - android 5.01).
