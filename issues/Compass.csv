MiCode/Compass,open,Inaccurate readings should not be shown,[],"When a device is not resting perfectly horizontal, the compass may point at an incorrect location. On a real compass, if it tipped too far from horizontal it stops working in a way that is obvious to the user (usually the needle becomes ""stuck"" and, in water filled compassses, the air bubble is no longer in the center). It would be nice if this virtual compass had the same features. Using the tilt sensors, it would be possible to have the compass detect when it is too far from horizontal and show the needle differently (perhaps flashing?). Would you please consider doing this? Alternately (or additionally) drawing an ""air bubble"" floating on the top of the compass would help people to know how to tilt the compass to get the most accurate readings.
