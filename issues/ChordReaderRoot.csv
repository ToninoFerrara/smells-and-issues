nolanlawson/ChordReaderRoot,closed,How to best integration with songs database?,[],"I Just love it, thanks a bunch!

I'd be interested in integrating a (community-based web) database of songs+chords with it. Would you be interested in the idea and/or available to hint me on the best way to do it in your current code basis?

Related features would be the synchronisation (download) of some user-selected sets of chords, upload of local modifications, and integration of search engine, a.o.

Thanks again!
Berteh.

I've had this app on my phone and love it. I am also getting a tablet soon and want to use your app to replace my songbook. My question is, does your app accept bluetooth keyboard commands such as pageup pagedown and arrows to scroll? The reason for the question is I want to use the pageflip cicada foot pedal for hands free scrolling and want to see if your app is compatible.
