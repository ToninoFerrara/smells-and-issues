rahulaga/WorldClock,closed,Copyright violation,[],"Hi @rahulaga 

I found [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cjc2.worldclock) on the Google Play Store. This guy just took your source code, added some ads in it and put it on the Store, without warning this is free software...

As you are the owner of the source code, feel free to open a request to google [here](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_dmca?product=googleplay) to remove the false app from the Store, if it's your wish ;)

Don't forget to tell Google that:

* The app is licensed under GNU GPL v3 license and this guy is violating it;
* He is falsely claiming he made the app;
* Provide a link to thie repo and screenshots of your own app."
rahulaga/WorldClock,open,Add 24 hour format,[],"Hi, I dislike am/pm time formatting. it's very confusing looking at 12 am and 12 pm (or 11am and 11pm) of places in different countries, maybe different days, all on the same screen.
vs 00h00 and 12h00 / 11h00 and 23h00 would be much clearer for me, and I think a lot of people. 24hour clock format is extremely popular."
rahulaga/WorldClock,open,Sorting timezones,[],"Hi,

I really like your app. It's very simple and useful. Thanks for creating and sharing it!!

It would be very helpful if the timezones can be sorted. Right now their sort order seems to be completely random. I tried adding timezones in the order I want them displayed, and also reverse order but that did not help.

I think by default it should sort by timezone offset. (a checkbox, checked by default)
Then there should be a move up/down option to create an arbitrary sort order by user's preference."
rahulaga/WorldClock,open,TimeZone data is outdated resulting in wrong times,[],"It seems your data source for time zone infotmation is outdated. Check for example America/Port au Prince.

rahulaga/WorldClock,open,Adding duplicate timezone,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Currently the add is silently ignored. (If trying to add zone already in list)
Add a dialog to prompt and then over-write or not? Or overwrite everytime?
