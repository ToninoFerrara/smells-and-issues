lordi/tickmate,open,"Swap rows and columns in journal, show track name","[Label(name=""feature"")]","Thank your for this most useful app!

Unfortunately, it is so useful, that I already hit the wall with it: I
have a lot of aspects of my life I would like to quantify, currently
15, with desire for more. This leads to two problems:

- The individual columns become extremely narrow, partly
  overlapping/cutting off each other, especially in portrait mode,
  which I very much prefer.

- Identifying the tracks by an icon is already difficult for some
  people (personally, I find it cumbersome, my brain's text matching
  engine seems to work a lot better), but with much more than 10
  items, it gets cumbersome for most people, I guess.

Therefore, I would love to see the following options implemented:

- An option ""Swap rows and columns"" (or similar), where
  each row shows one track, and each column shows a day.

- Especially for the row/column-swap-mode, but maybe also
  available in normal mode:
  Three options (only one can be selected at a time):

  ""Show track as ...""

  - ""icon""

  - ""text""

  - ""text + icon"" (intuitively, I think this order might suit most,
    but otherwise, add a fourth option ""icon + text"" :-}

  As opposed to the icons, track names can have varying lengths, so
  there should be a possibility to adjust the width of the track name
  display, either graphically or simply by some configurable value (in
  font points, pixels, mm, or whatever).
  
I know I'm asking quite a bit, but just imagine it was a long, dark
winter evening, and you were bored to death ... :-}

Replace the now redundant ""Days since last"" summary number (days since last can

of the track within the specified trend range. The trend range can be selected

trend range reaches back further than the first tick was recorded for that track.
In this case, a '?' will be displayed. Otherwise a tilted arrow shows the trend,
wheras a 45Â° maximum increasing/decreasing trend will be displayed as a vertical
arrow pointing straight upwards/downwards. Larger trend values are symbolized by
a dashed upwards/downwards arrow to visualized the capping at 45Â°.

- ""longest break"" seems to be always 1 day more than the actual longest break (it is at 1 if there has been no break)
- the streaks on the graph don't always correspond to the actual streaks
- sometimes the last day ticked is not counted in the streak: for example, I have a 3 days streak, then I tick the item, but still have a 3 days streak.
- I've unticked some days of my different series, then re-ticked them: the count has changed (for some series it went bigger, for some others smaller). In fact, it seems that some days were not taken into account for the streak until I unticked and re-ticked them.

It pulls the tracks from the device and lets you add and remove Ticks from your wrist + it shows you your weekly stats. I used the Android Wear MessageApi for reading/writing data, so the app won't work without your phone being nearby. I made this choice mostly because of privacy concerns, as the only other option - the Google DataApi - would sync your sensitive data through Google's Cloud services.

At first I had the same bug when I created new tracks: I could tick the new track but I couldn't see the icon. Strangely, I don't have any problem anymore when I create new tracks.
I know this bug is not very important but I thought I could report it anyway.

I tested with the versions 1.2.2 and 1.2.1, and the bug is present only in the version 1.2.2. I couldn't try with 1.2.0 as the app crashed each time I tried to add a track. I use Android 4.4.4.

lordi/tickmate,closed,Protect journals from accidental messing up,[],"It seems currently there is no protection from user mistakes.

For example, in context menu of a track in ""My tracks"" dialog ""Deactivate"" and ""Delete"" items are close to each other and ""Delete"" command just deletes track without any confirmation. Thus it is relatively easy to miss desired menu item and instead of disabling track delete it.

Backup feature is not enough protection as it requires manual actions and cannot be triggered by schedule.

The second problem is a high chance for messing up records for past days. I suppose that previos days records should be protected somehow. Possible approaches:
1. Changing tick for past days should ask for confirmation
2. Editing ticks might be allowed for just one ""active"" date
- Row of active date should be highlighted.
- When app launches active date should be set to today.
- Tapping on a tick on other day than active should display notification ""Select this date before editing records"".
- A user can set any date as active by tapping on row header (the first cell in row with date info)

I'm not sure how to call the tracks though, as I don't know what you had in mind when you picked the name. For now I picked the Spanish 'pista' as in a race track or runway (it also happens to mean 'clue') because it's the most direct translation. But maybe you wanted something more like 'way' and 'journey', or maybe like 'footpath', or perhaps like 'record' and 'trace'. Let me know and I'll update it.

Cheers!

The one thing I thought about, which I don't think is in Tickmate (yet) is as follows. I give myself certain weekly goals. For example, ride my bicycle two times a week, make breakfast two times a week, and dinner three times. It would be nice to configure this ahead of time. Then if I rode my bike on monday, I would tick it off, and then I would see that I have to do it one more time this week.

I hope this makes sense and that you like this idea enough to implement it. :-)

I would like to have the possibility to add a little note to some of my ""bits"". To add e.g. some stats to a bike-tour (distance, time), or why this was a good day, or what fast food I ate, ...
This would maybe overlap with issue #11 (multiple ticks per day) as you can add a note like: ""I did this 3 times"".

Some further ideas:
Visually the ticks with a note have a little hint/icon/text. A long press on a tick will open up a note-edit-box to add or edit the specific tick-note. A maximum lenght of maybe 50-100 characters is more than enough to add a few words.

I am still new to programming so it would not be so easy for me to contribute, but i could make a Danish translation of the tracks.
