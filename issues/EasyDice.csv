pejic/EasyDice,open,Fudge dice,[],"Hi, can there be support for fudge dice? They are 6 sided dice with:

Two sides negative
Two sides blank
Two sides positive

The negatives count as -1, the blanks are 0, and the positives are +1.
"
pejic/EasyDice,open,Alternate range,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Implement a way to count dice starting at 0 instead of 1.  For example rolling a D6 normally produces a result in the range [1, 6], but for some games it is necessary to have results in the range of [0, 5].
"
pejic/EasyDice,open,Subtraction feature,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Design and implement a way to subtract certain dice from the total instead of adding to it.
"
pejic/EasyDice,open,Add D2 and D3,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",
pejic/EasyDice,open,[iOS] D30,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Add D30 to iOS app.

Depends on
- #7 for the assets.
- #8 update iOS app.
"
pejic/EasyDice,open,[iOS] Update for iOS 8,[],"Update the iOS project so that new enhancements are even possible.
"
pejic/EasyDice,closed,[Android] Add D30,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Develop graphics for a D30 and add them into the app.
"
pejic/EasyDice,open,Dice Set Titles,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Continuing #2. It would be good to be able to rename the dice sets from their current numbers 0, 1, 2... to whatever the user wishes.
"
pejic/EasyDice,closed,Update on Graphics,[],"I mentioned in #4 about redesigning the dice. What I didn't realise was that your dice are rendered from actual 3D models where as I thought they would just be images. It was those images that I was proposing to redesign for you, but alas 3D modelling is very much not my expertise. As an apology for the confusion, I fixed the problem with the README not rendering and tidied it up a little :)
"
pejic/EasyDice,closed,Redesign,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hey! I'd be interested in redesigning the dice that are use in your app. I have [some experience](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Numix-Square-icons-446392650?offset=10#comments) with design but I'm looking to get more experience so I'm offering my services for free (and with no commitment) to F-Droid developers :)
"
pejic/EasyDice,open,Colored dice,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Some games require distinct sets of dice to be rolled at once. Showing the sum for each color would be helpful there too.
"
pejic/EasyDice,closed,Support for saving dice sets,[],"It would be nice to have the ability to save a set of dice for easy use in the future (e.g., different attacks in an RPG game).
"
pejic/EasyDice,closed,Clone URL on the webpage needs authentication,[],"The clone URL on the webpage is over SSH and needs authentication to work. Using the HTTPS URL is recommended.
