marunjar/anewjkuapp,open,Support Moodle calendar,[],"What do you think of the idea of adding support for the moodle calendar?
Since the DSGVO somehow enforces the professors to use moodle instead of the institute's own solution, its calendar contains a quite useful list of assignment deadlines.
I already managed to get the ical from moodle without any user interaction, but I have no idea how to include it into this app...

[MoodleCalendar.java](https://github.com/fsteff/anewjkuapp/blob/56e0f90faabe0ac89cef38e4dda3cc5f6d728a84/aNewJKUApp/src/main/java/org/voidsink/anewjkuapp/moodle/MoodleCalendar.java)"

marunjar/anewjkuapp,closed,Login is not stored on phone,[],"Login with wrong student number/password returns an error as expected.
When I enter the correct data, I come to the normal screen. But it's not possible to view any data at all. Furthermore the header says: ""please login"", like no login was added.

With ```adb logcat *:D``` I found some interesting line:

```
03-01 17:11:02.631 21829 21829 I KusssAuthenticatorActivity: finish login to 15*****
03-01 17:11:02.637  2264  3165 W AccountManagerService: insertAccountIntoDatabase: Account {name=15*****, type=org.voidsink.anewjkuapp.account}, skipping since the account already exists
```

But when I looked into the account section of the Settings, ```JKU App``` does not show any accounts added for this app. And the app itself also does not find any accounts to use because the login window is showed at the start.

Better: incremental update or replace when loading is finished
