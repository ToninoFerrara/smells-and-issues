dimtion/Shaarlier,open,Not showing dropdown suggestions for tags,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I upgraded phones and of course installed Shaarlier. It works fine, but one thing I see different. I have 3 tags which start with 2: 2save, 2look, 2buy.

On my old phone, when I would start typing ""2"" in the tags field, it would show me all 3 tags which start with 2 in a drop-down so I could choose which one I wanted.

On my new phone, it doesn't show me anything - it just makes me type in the tag completely. The link saves in my shaarli correctly with the tag, so everything seems to be working.

Could you please fix it?

I have recently been playing around with a Shaarli server and have it setup behind HTTP Basic Auth. When I tried out the Shaarlier app I noticed Basic Auth wasn't supported, so I've gone ahead and added it.

I've done some light testing so far and it seems to work well. I still need to handle database upgrades correctly, so I'm hoping to finish it off soon. I thought I'd create this pull request now to give you a heads up and for you to let me know if you would like anything changed. If you'd like this on a different branch let me know and I'll try to move it.

Cheers!

dimtion/Shaarlier,closed,define expected html structure (a.k.a. API) ?,"[Label(name=""other"")]","Hi @dimtion,

I recently published on iOS something very similar to what you did for Android. One of the problems I had was the missing API or how to parse the html and find the relevant data.

Do you think we should agree on a mechanism to parse the html so we consider the same shaarli templates valid and can give hints or even a testbed to template creators?

See https://github.com/mro/ShaarliOS/issues/1, does that make sense to you?

Cheers,
    @mro

it might be best to only obtain a title if the application didn't receive a title from the share intent. The Pindroid application ( https://code.google.com/p/pindroid/ ), which I use, only obtains a title if it didn't receive one.

I am not sure how many people might use it but you could always have a refresh button at the far end if the user wanted to get the title from the website rather than use the one obtained from share intent.
