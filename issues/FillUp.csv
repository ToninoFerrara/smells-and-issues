wdkapps/FillUp,open,diagrams and statistics not working for old dates,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I entered data of an old car I once possessed, this was in 2002. Now, when I take a look at the diagrams it shows the years from 1970 up to 2014, however there's nothing drawn inside. Also the year range 1970-2014 is illogical, it would be reasonable to offer only the ranges where some data is present (i.e. 2002-2003). The same ist valid for the statistics, I can see only empty data for 2013 and 14 (the car has long been sold, so in fact there is no data), but no data for 2002 when I used the car is printed. So, for old data the diagrams and statistic functions are rather useless, that's a pitty but maybe you could fix this?

"
wdkapps/FillUp,open,Don't require odometer readings for partial fills,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","What I'd like is the option to not enter an odometer reading if I'm not filling the tank. Here's an example:

I'm in a hurry and just need a little extra gas. I add a couple gallons, snap a picture of the gas pump, and I'm off. Later, I fill up, and record the odometer. The mileage should be the difference between this full tank's odometer and the last full tank's odometer divided by how much gas I put in this time plus that little splash I did earlier.

It seems to me the mileage should be computed between tankfuls. I can't see what is gained computationally by recording the odometer from just a couple gallons added.

To clarify my suggestion: if I don't check ""Tank Full"", then don't consider blank an invalid odometer value. It won't be used for computation, so has no real use.
"
wdkapps/FillUp,open,No calculations because Tank Full not checked,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi William,

I am using your fillup for two cars, mine and my wife and I like it very much.

I had one small problem and it told me after the first time it will calculate ..... the second time.
But after the second time the same message.
After the third time I decided to check your website and found in FAQ the problem I did not mark Tank Full.

I saw also more persons encountered this problem, so I have two suggestions:

First:
In the text after the first time it will calculate after the second time, add do not forget to fill Tank full!

Second:

Change the layout of the Add fuel menu, see attachment.
In this case it forms better part of the fill out information.

Thanks again for this app

"
wdkapps/FillUp,closed,Fuel cost per mile calculation is incorrect,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello,
I find your app very useful but I feel that you are using the wrong method to determine  fuel cost per mile. I have been an owner operator truck driver for over 20 years and the way I have always calculated and the way I was taught  Is that you divide the cost per gallon by the miles per gallon. The method you use is only utilizing the current miles driven so you end up with an inflated cost.
Other than that I love your app and will continue to use it and recommend it to other drivers. Thanks for the good work.

"
wdkapps/FillUp,open,Statistics Only Display 24 months of Data when ALL selected,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I've been using your app now for several months and like the app very much.  I use to keep my gas mileage log in a hand written note pad.  As I have been using your app I have been entering new transactions and also been entering old transactions from my hand written log.  Eventually I entered a few years worth of transactions (approx. 100 entries).  I noticed that in the statistics section that when I select ""All"" it does not really utilize all the transactions.  Also, the graphs do not use all the transactions either, but that seems reasonable because you are limited with the size of the graph.  Is this something that can be fixed with the statistics section?  My vehicle is 4 years old and it would be nice to see averages for the entire 4 years.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S3.

Thanks,

I only have one sugestion. In South America we buy fuel in US gallons, but drive in kilometers.  So we need an kl/gallon option.

"
wdkapps/FillUp,closed,editing already created log changes price number format so that it can't be saved,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hi,

steps to reproduce:
1. create log with total price higher than thousand (1000)
2. save
3. edit the log (you don't have to change anything)
4. press ok

Error message says: ""Invalid cost value""
It is caused by space inserted in the total price (1 000). If you delete it, the log can be saved.

- ease data entry by allowing more values to be entered while waiting for tank to fill, and less after tank is full when rushing to leave station. example: enter odometer and fuel price...when tank is full, just need to enter 1 value (total cost) - gallons would be calculated from price and cost. otherwise, enter odometer, then wait for full tank and need to enter gallons and cost.
- display calculated fuel price during data entry - currently need to go to log to verify that it is correct
