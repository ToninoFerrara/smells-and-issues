The same keys being found in different positions in different parts of the same layout leads to inconsistency. It could be avoided by making up for the missing row with some other special characters.

VladThodo/behe-keyboard,open,Add option to disable full screen mode,[],"Hello there. The keyboard is very nice. I am trying to use it on a device with a very small screen. This is one of the few keyboards with a nice layout that I could run on a MIPS processor. But as the screen is also round, it's hard to see what is being type. Some keyboards have an option to disable full screen mode (I think most don't do it anymore, because it was needed only when the actual keyboard would not even fit the screen, and it is not the case anymore with Material Design). If you could add this option in settings, it would be great!

Also, please add a key to latch settings or at least make the text area in the welcome page scrollable and shorter so we can also see the buttons on small screens.

While I am here, enabling prediction caused the app to force close, in both my devices (MIPS Android 5.1 and ARM Android 6.0.1). I was able keyboard v.1.1.2 by the way.

It would be really nice if the alphabet keys didn't change their poistions while switching between programming and qwerty layout. 
My fingers keep hitting wrong keys in the programming layout due to muscle memory.
I would suggest placing the symbols in a new row above the alphabets.

Another thing I would like to point out is that the backspace key is positioned a little bit lower compared to other keyboards, which makes me keep hitting the L key when I want to press backspace.
