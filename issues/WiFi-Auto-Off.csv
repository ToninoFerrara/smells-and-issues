j4velin/WiFi-Auto-Off,closed,feature request: stop switching on during a period of time,[],"I recently installed WiFi-Automatic on my Wileyfox Swift, running CyanogenMod 13.

Switch on:

- during charging

Switch off: 
- if no network is within reach
- daily at 10:00 pm

Everything works fine except for switching off at 10:00 pm. Even if I switch it off by myself, it is switched on again to connect to my home network. 

It looks like it is still switching on every hour even between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am to look for known networks? 

May I ask to add a feature to set a time span when wireless is never automatically switched on?

Thanks in advance.

j4velin/WiFi-Auto-Off,closed,Multiuser support,[],"Hi everybody

Thanks for your great app.

I've installed this app on my multi user tablet for a single user. WiFi Automatic is configured to turn WiFi off when the screen is off for five minutes and turn WiFi on when unlocking the device.

Consider the following scenario misbehaving:
- User 1 with installed WiFi Automatic does anything
- User 1 locks the screen (means, that WiFi will be turned off in 5 minutes)
- User 2 without installed WiFi Automatic, unlocks de device
- After 5 minutes WiFi will be turned off

I think, the app should be able to work with multiple user accounts. 

Thank you

"
j4velin/WiFi-Auto-Off,closed,Possibly causes DataStats app to stop functioning,[],"Hopefully not too many (or any) people have read my initial versions of this Issue post.  I've updated it to provide more details.

Here's the issue in a nutshell: I have used DataStats ( https://github.com/takke/DataStats ) for quite a while without a single issue.  I then installed WiFi-Automatic.  After installing WiFi-Automatic, DataStats would no longer work after I turned the screen off, waited just a few seconds, and then turned it back on.  DataStats would see no data after turning the screen back on.

I figured it was probably an app conflict, so I uninstalled WiFi-Automatic expecting DataStats to start working again.  Even after rebooting, DataStats works great until the screen is turned off; once the screen is turned off and then back on, it no longer shows throughput stats.  Reinstalling DataStats does not help.

So the big question: is it possible that WiFi-Automatic has changed something that would persist after being uninstalled?

I looked through my logs to try to determine if it could be something else.  I had updated a couple apps, but I took a close look at those, and I highly doubt there could be any relationship to this issue.

The only other thing that I did was run (it was already installated) and then uninstall Wifi Key Recovery ( https://github.com/alt236/Wifi-Key-Recovery---Android ).  It had root privs, but it should be read-only.

Since running WiFi-Automatic, I can't get DataStats to survive a screen off/on cycle.  As such, I am now limited in the testing I can provide.  Perhaps others can try the following to see if it reproduces the issue:

Steps I took:
1. Install DataStats ( https://github.com/takke/DataStats )
2. Set DataStats to auto start on boot
3. Reboot*
4. Install WiFi-Automatic ( https://github.com/j4velin/WiFi-Automatic )
5. Reboot
6. Let system stabilize after boot
6. Turn off screen
7. Wait a few seconds
8. Turn on screen
9. DataStats is now frozen at whatever level it was displaying when screen turned off
- I had updated a couple apps and ran then uninstalled Wifi Key Recovery at this step.

j4velin/WiFi-Auto-Off,closed,[FR] Extend range for screen off delay,[],"Thanks for this app!

When the screen is off/locked, the maximum time to wait until disabling wifi is one hour. On the one side, I want my phone to disable wifi, if I don't use it for an extended time. On the other hand, I use my phone as a ""new mail reminder"", so its wifi should be enabled for a reasonable time. And one hour is just a bit too short. Two hours or maybe three would be perfect, I think.

So could you please extend the allowed range to maybe 5 or 6 hours? Maybe even 12 hours. I really don't know.

I don't know, if the chooser can be filled with only useful entries, if so, I'd recommend to not use every minute starting from 30 minutes. Maybe …, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300 would be good options? The number entry keypad can still be used to enter more detailed values?

Well, no other FOSS GUI apps do this and custom ROMs frequently have the value above legal limits; you could save battery with a lower value of about 12dBm for some access points. To achieve the latter you might want a weak/strong value for each access point, altering the UI somewhat or you could guess the value based on signal strength. Perhaps this is beyond the scope of the app.
