AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,[MAL] Display Anime/Manga tabs only if user has both lists.,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","BRIEF:
I guess there are people who track only one type of content(for example, I do not use mangalist on MAL at all). Now on the main page I always see tabs for switching between anime and manga lists. As far as I do not have manga list, these tabs are useless and the only thing they do is consume space.

STEPS_TO_REPRODUCE:
1. Open app.
2. Login using MAL account which has only one list.

ACTUAL_RESULT:
There is a useless switcher between two lists.

EXPECTED_RESULT:
Screen space is not used for displaying stuff which is definitely useless.

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Dirty flag rewrite,[],"This PR is a rewrite of the whole dirty flag stuff. Now it is possible to check which properties are changed.
To do this I have reintroduced some of the setter functions that were removed with the implementation of lombok. These setters now add the property name to dirty, which is a ArrayList now. There is also a second implementation of this setters which accept a second boolean argument which allows to define if the property should be marked as dirty (this is used when the record is loaded from the database by `fromCursor()`).

Because of the new setter functions which mark the properties as dirty themselves we don't need to call `setDirty()` anymore after updating a value, which is a nice side effect.

The `addOrUpdateAnime()`/`addOrUpdateManga()` functions in `MALApi` read the changed properties by iterating through the dirty-ArrayList and getting the values by reflection (which makes it quite easy to get them) and pass them as FieldMap to the retrofit interface functions. This way the app always sends only changed properties to the API, not everything as until now (this only affects MAL currently, there should be no difference for AniList).

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Database fixes and a little cleanup,[],"After deleting the database (on logout), no new one was created because the MALSqlHelper was not recreated for two reasons:
- the MALSqlHelper is designed as singleton (object is retrieved by calling `getHelper()`), but `instance` was not unset after deleting the database
- `malSqlHelper` was defined as static in DatabaseManager, so even fixing the first point would not fix the bug, because all instances of DatabaseManager share the same `malSqlHelper` which is not recreated if set once.

Now MALSqlHelper has the new function `deleteDatabase()` that deletes the database and sets `instance` to null so the next call to `getHelper()` will recreate the database. Also `malSqlHelper` is not defined as static in DatabaseManager.
I'm a little confused actually, because this should have never worked before... but it has somehow.

Also noticed a possible access violation while testing: running NetworkTasks while deleting the database can cause access violations, so cancel running NetworkTasks on logout to make sure that the tasks are not accessing the database when it is deleted.

I've also found some unused MALManager variables and removed them.

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Grid Too Short,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Since all the major changes to the UI, the grid covers are now too short on many devices. The display aspect ratio should be 0.7, but often the cells are too short. It looks like the code dealing with setting the proper height was removed, but an equivalent was not provided. As such, it's using the fallback height defined in the layout file.

Correct behavior should be to get the width of the cell and then determine height by dividing that width by 0.7. As some of the methods aren't present in API 8, I believe the old behavior got the screen width in dp, calculated how many columns would fit, then determined the correct height to assign to the cell.

I'll poke around when I get time, but if anyone can get a proper solution in place before then, please do so.

This will support our next enchantment.

How do I receive a card view?

```
Card view = ((Card) findViewById(R.id.name_card));

The cards do have different methods:

setContent(int resource)
This adds the content in the card.

```
((Card) findViewById(R.id.details_card)).setContent(R.layout.card_profile_details);
```

setCardColor(int color)
This will change the card color
Note: use the colors in the colors.xml file

```
((Card) findViewById(R.id.details_card)).setCardColor(R.color.white)
```

setHeaderColor(int color)
The same usages as the ""setCardColor"" method

wrapWidth(Boolean header)
Wraps the card in width
Note: the boolean is used for the header
If it is set on true the card will check also the width of the header.
Note 2: Use only if the card has been fully loaded

```
((Card) findViewById(R.id.details_card)).wrapWidth(false)
```

wrapHeight()
Wraps the card in height
Note: it is recommended to use the xml attribute.

```
((Card) findViewById(R.id.details_card)).wrapHeight()
```

Attributes:
- header_Title
  This will set the Header title (String)
- header_Title_Color
  This will set the Header text color (Recource)
- header_Title_center
  This will center the text if true (boolean)
- header_Color
  This will set the Header color (Recource)
- card_Color

- card_ColorPressed
  This will set the Card color when pressed (Recource)
  if not defined it will use the default one.
- card_TouchFeedback
  This will enable the ""card_ColorPressed"" attribute  (Boolean)
- card_WrapHeight

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Networktask improvements,[],"I've done some more NetworkTask improvements:
### unification

AnimeNetworkTask and MangaNetworkTask are replaced by NetworkTask, they where both doing the same except for the result. So this removes some duplicated code and also makes the handling easier as there is no ListType-check needed when creating a new Task (the ListType gets simply passed to the constructor).
### more flexible usage

As of #176 the result type of the NetworkTask is Object instead of ArrayList, this allows different results for different jobs. So GET and GETDETAIL now directly return an Anime or Manga object instead of ArrayLists with only one item.
Also additional data (like the page number for the paged lists or a anime/manga record for GETDETAILS) is now passed with a Bundle object to the NetworkTask constructor. This makes it more flexible for different taks and future additions and prevents multiple constructors.
### task cancellation

The current task is now cancelled if the user selects an other list. This avoids unnecessary computation of unneeded data and as side effect it fixes #190.
FORCESYNC-tasks are a exception for this: they keep running even if canceled and can complete the sync. Their results are just not shown if they are cancelled, but the sync gets done.

Steps to reproduce:

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,List enhancements and cleanup,[],"I've done some enhancements and cleanup to the whole list loading in the Home-Activity and everything related (which I wanted to do since the API rewrite^^):

- moved the loading indicator from activity_home.xml to fragment_animelist.xml as now the indicator can be displayed independent for anime- and mangalist (they can have different loading times depending how many items are on them)
- keep selected list after rotation
- **IMHO most important improvement:** don't reload list after rotation: anime- and mangalist are now serializable so they can be passed to the Bundle in onSaveInstanceState and reloaded in onCreateView (this also keeps the scrolling position), this prevents unnecessary redownloading of lists (most popular, upcoming etc.) and makes the UI smoother

"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Parse dates from MAL,[],"MAL uses some different date formats and as the API is scraping the HTML from MAL, Atarashii has to deal with it :-).
So I created a class which can parse all those date formats and creates Date-Objects of them, which can be used to get the dates formatted in a unique way and to translate them.
The dateformats I noticed on MAL (in data relevant to Atarashii) are:

**fixed dates**:
- yyyy-MM-dd, h:m a
- MM-dd-yy, h:m a
- MMMM dd, yyyy

**relative dates:**
- EEEE, h:m a
- Yesterday, h:m a
- x hours/minutes ago

(see [time pattern syntax](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) for explanation of those variables)

The class _MALDateTools_ can convert all these date formats and can return them as
- Date-Object
- ISO 8601 date strings (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ)
- formatted date strings (with format definitions from string resources)

Database: all dates which are stored in the database are now stored as ISO 8601 strings. For last online this fixes one issue: currently if the last online date is ""4 minutes ago"" this string will be saved in the database and it will be also 4 minutes ago if I look at the friendlist or profile tomorrow without resync. By storing a complete date this can be calculated correctly.

The returned date strings are also converted to the time zone of the device. Formatted date strings are also relative if they are not too far in the past:
- for dates which are less than a hour ago: _""x minutes ago""_
- for dates which are less than a day ago: _""x hours ago""_
- for dates which are less than two days ago: _""Yesterday, Time""_
- for dates which are less than five days ago: _""Dayname, Time""_
- everything else will be formatted as _""Date, Time""_

All these formats are defined as resources to make them translatable.

If date parsing fails (that happend never in my tests) everything acts as before: dates are stored and displayed as they are returned by the API.

**Downside:** there is one downside: the date format ""x hours ago"" can't be parsed exactly, because eg. ""5 hours ago"" can be 300 to 359 minutes ago. As far as I can tell this format is only used for the last online date so it might be not a big problem.

Caution: Your activity will be destroyed and recreated each time the user rotates the screen. When the screen changes orientation, the system destroys and recreates the foreground activity because the screen configuration has changed and your activity might need to load alternative resources (such as the layout).

If the activity is destroyed and the same instance must be recreated, the system passes the state data defined at (1) to both the onCreate() method (2) and the onRestoreInstanceState() method (3).

I was working on issue #55 to use retrofit for API communication and I think it is now ready to show you.
While I rewrote the API stuff I had to touch a major part of the code and noticed some things that could be optimized together with the API changes. Here is an overview about my changes as this pull request is quite big:
- **API:** 
  - rewritten to use the retrofit library (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) which makes API handling much easier as it does all the deserialization (see MalApi.java and MalInterface.java in the api package)
  - added the response package which contains all the classes for deserialization
- **database:**
  - new class DatabaseManager which handles the database access stuff, this is mostly for better readability as MALManager is a little simpler now
  - removed anime_time_days_d and manga_time_days_d and changed type of anime_time_days and manga_time_days to double: saving the same value in different columns is bad behaviour, better convert them if needed
  - defined UNIQUE columns in every table (recordID in anime/manga, username inf friend/profile), this allows using the replace()-function so there is no need to care about if data needs to be inserted or updated (thats why itemExists() is gone)
- **general code changes:**
  - needed to change nearly every thing that touches data, but tried to change as little as possible
  - removed AsyncTasks for fetching anime/mangalists because they where implemented multiple times, so I rewrote them to provide a callback function and put them in the tasks-package
  - simplified some things
  - little cleanups (like unused imports)
- **misc:**
  - updated readme and acknowledgements in about to credit Square Inc. for retrofit and Google Inc. for Gson (which is used by retrofit)

Everything should be working like before as far as I noticed, but with easier API handling.

The unofficial api is almost every 2 weeks offline for 3 days.
For some users is this really a minus point.

I have found already a interesting host (No bandwidth control).
We can make use of a java web application.

It will take a lot of time but i think if it is once ready and up it will benefit us.
Atarashii doesn't have to modified because we can just use the same json structure.
We can implement more stuff from mal.

What do you guys think?

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Auto-sync & bug fix,[],"Chis already knows but still,

I did some cleanups and added a new feature Auto-sync.
Removed force sync from the popular/top list, fixed also a few bug ;)
Added me as author, i don't want to publish my last name (chris knows it)

EDITH 1:
I accidentally used fragmentReady(); instead of autosynctask(); this is updated at (2311af9).

EDITH 2:
Fixed a bug: if you go to top rated,scroll down, press a anime which is not in your list, return to my list and press on a anime(4bac937).

EDITH 3:
Cleanup (API was called 2x which was causing a force crash) (a3a39d8).
No autosync bug left :D

EDITH 4:
Added option for auto-sync: start auto-sync ONLY when you are using WiFi (against wasting data).
(c62d59f, bedf95b, ce04071 and acd77c6)

EDITH 5:
After you saw the top/popular list and return to mylist.
it goes then to your last visited list type (578bb40).

EDITH 6:
cleanup & fix Exception (ef50393, 0aac5b2 and 300f5d4).

EDITH 7:
Added Upcoming & Just added to the drawer(Thanks Eric Yu). (62cabcf, 6f50811, f91ee76 and 2a31a42)
Added view on my anime list (not listed). (9507ed2)

EDITH 8:
Fixed no records issue, on resume, nav.drawer network problem (d6d0aa1)
Added getMode(9f57ea0)

EDITH 9:
Fixed API crash is you have no internet connection. (744bcac, f610437 and 2550f6d)

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Switch to ActionBarCompat,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Starting an issue to prompt discussion on moving from ActionBarSherlock to the new ActionBarCompat which is part of the updated compatibility library.

The major benefit is that we don't need to track ABS anymore and we can remove at least one sub-module.

There are some downsides, though. It's new, so it hasn't been as heavily tested. There are likely bugs waiting to be found with it. Also, it's effort on our side to switch, but I don't see a huge benefit from the change aside from what was listed above.

Also, it might be worth looking at the user distribution of the application via the store. If there aren't a lot of pre-4.0 users, it might be even better to lock 1.3 as the last ""compatible"" version and make 1.4+ work on Android 4.0+ (minSdkVersion=14) only.

Thoughts?

It'll probably require quite a bit of retooling, as the SyncAdapter relies on the ContentProvider and can't exist without using the AccountManager.

"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,open,Intent Based Updates (+3rd party hooks),"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","At some unspecified time in the future, I'd like for Atarashii! to move to intent based updates. What that means is that we only need our AsyncTasks in one place, thus cleaner code, and that third party apps that request the permissions can leverage Atarashii! as an easy way to work with MAL.

What this entails, as far as I know is:
      -BroadcastReceiver to receive and hand off intents to a..
      -Service that will process the request specified by the intent
      -And some sort of communications back to the app that fired the intent, possibly a broadcast message for the app to receive

So with this, third party apps, for example a manga reader, would be able to fire an intent saying ""I've read a chapter"", and have Atarashii! handle it, updating both itself and MAL. Also our internal code will be cleaner and more abstracted, which is always good.

Namely, what do we do when there is an issue with getting a connection and what do we do when the unofficial API is having issues/returning bad data?

My thought is to make all changes go into a ""queue"" before running the action against the API. This will allow us to break the network connection handling into its own area where we can do things like not updating if there is no data connection, or retaining changes until we get a good response back from the API.

As a bonus, handling changes in this way would allow a better ""offline mode"" for the application. Of course, cover art wouldn't be downloaded in an offline mode, but it is what it is and we can always offer a selection in settings/preferences to force-download all missing cover art at once.

Keep in mind that choosing a license also affects what third-party components can be used within the source as some licenses can conflict. I don't expect a lot of problems, but it is something to consider.

Also keep in mind that without copyright assignment, changing the license to the software gets more difficult as the number of contributors climb as every contributor must agree to the change or you'll need to strip out their contributions to make the change.

This issue is to discuss licensing and hopefully reach a conclusion on the best license for the project to use.

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,List Style Setting,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Someone requested somewhere (I think it was in a direct email to me) that we add back the traditional list rather than the beautiful grid of covers that we have (why?). Honestly, I can see this being pretty easy. If the option for this is enabled, we can just set the columns of grid view to 1 (effectively list view), and load an alternate layout, which I think would just be kind of the bottom part of the covers, and use a kind of zoom crop fill on the image to fill the horizontal space behind the panel.

Effectively the traditional list view, but retain our modern styling. May or may not have this ready for 1.1, so not assigning the milestone.

AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,"Proper ""About"" View","[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Instead of squishing credits and about into into the settings area, there should be a nice ""About"" view.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Quick-Action popup for cover grid,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","There should be a popup menu on the cover grid that allows quick actions to be done without going into the detail view.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Make List Selection Items use Radio Buttons instead of Checkboxes,[],"As mentioned at [this comment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.somethingdreadful.MAL&reviewId=07175518557070469388), the list switch options should probably be radio buttons rather than checkboxes. Radio buttons clearly indicate a single selection possibility while checkboxes are common for multiple selections.

Personally, I think this might be a good use for scrollable tabs as described [here](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html).
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Search/Add Support,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I'm really bad at writing summaries, so I'll keep it short. The gist of this would be:

```
 -Possibly a search action view thing in the ActionBar, the expandable one
 -New search results
 -New menu xml with basically just a ""Add to List"" button to be used in the DetailView if the record isn't on a list
 -And of course, the backing code to make this work.
```

Hopefully some of the existing net code in place can be reused to leverage MAL's search api.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Manga Support,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Atarashii needs to build out manga support so as to become a good daily-driver application for updates at least.

This issue comprises several tasks:
- Building out a MangaRecord class
- Making the display grid generic
- Making the detail view generic
- If impossible to make things full generic, look to use inheritance so as to share as much code as possible between the items
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Allow Episode Display to Handle More Than Two Digits,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","As noted by [this comment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.somethingdreadful.MAL&reviewId=04230128318862925853) and [this other comment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.somethingdreadful.MAL&reviewId=05760653475141387455), the application is only displaying the first two digits of three digit episode counts. This should be adjusted to handle really epic long series in some manner.

It might be worth reducing the size of the count on the tiles. The focus should be on the title of the series anyway, and using smaller text would allow for very large numbers if needed.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Detail View Work,[],"This is a rough start on a new detail view. It will likely need to be worked to handle narrow screens such as phones and needs some work on the information presentation to make it cleaner and more appealing. However, it's functional and clean. It also eliminates the kludge of having to wait to properly position the synopsis around the action bar as the presentation is changed to something that doesn't have that issue.

Also done are some changes to the synopsis text display. Now, the raw HTML is retained and used to format the display on the detail page. This has the benefit of keeping the original styling while also avoiding having to parse out tags and entities such as &mdash;. Instead, they are properly retained and displayed.

**Before you merge this in**, I highly suggest merging current working back to master (as it was released as a 1.0) and tagging the 1.0 release code. This will also allow fixing issue #6 and any other major issues on a maintenance branch so a bugfix release can be made without pulling in these changes until they are ready for release.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Out of Memory on really long lists,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I just had a report of the app crashing due to being out of memory. I have a pretty good idea how to fix this though. (reuse bitmaps instead of creating new ones)

On another note, I never thought I'd actually have to use these issue report things. They're handy.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Cover Panel counter wonked on Xoom/Tablets,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","What the title says. I pulled out my Xoom to see the grid scaling, which works great btw, and it looks like the number in the cover panels is not where it should be, and only shows max one digit instead of two. Not sure if this affects other tablets or if it's isolated to my Xoom. The Xoom is running 4.0.4 for reference. Will investigate.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Rename Application,[],"I highly suggest renaming the application, at least externally. ""Dreadful"" isn't exactly a positive word in English, and ""DreadfulMAL"" seems, to me at least, to sound more like a really bad application for MAL than something that's actually pretty awesome. Maybe it could be shortened to ""DMAL.""
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Scale the tile list,[],"These commits work toward a properly scaled list instead of the hard-coded columns from before. This is especially needed for tablets where you will have very wide screens and don't want huge tiles.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Clean up project and ignore binaries,[],"Use the recommended gitignore values for Android projects and
remove previously tracked files that shouldn't be tracked as they
are generated or binary files.
"
AnimaSA/Atarashii,closed,Empty list crash+data reload,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","what the title says, happened to me with my empty ""on hold"" list fix it fix it fix it

basically just leaving myself a note so I don't forget
