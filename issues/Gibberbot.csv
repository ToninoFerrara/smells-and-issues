I'm not sure why they call it a ""less secure app."", or whether anything can be done to mitigate this. Just putting it here for the sake of information.

Thank you for ChatSecure!

The same file, line 291 is now ""<string name=""smp_question_summary"">為了要驗證對方身分, 打入一個要問聯絡人的問題, 跟對方回答你預想好的正確的回應</string>"".
I think it would be more proper to revise a few words: ""<string name=""smp_question_summary"">為了驗證對方身分, 輸入一個要問聯絡人的問題, 讓對方回答你預想好的正確答案</string>"", which is more in line with the context and also grammar."

I'm running ChatSecure for Android (info.guardianproject.otr.app.im version 14.2.3) and I cannot connect to my self-hosted XMPP server: when I add the account, the side panel shows ""Connecting..."" but nothing happens and I cannot chat/add buddies.

My phone is a Samsung Galaxy SII (GT-i9100G) running CyanogenMod 10.2-201309-11-NIGHTLY-i9100G (Android 4.3)

My XMPP server is ejabberd 14.07 on Debian Jessie with a certificate issued by Let's Encrypt, and it works well with other clients (e.g. Pidgin) but it has a somewhat strict security policy, so maybe I'm enforcing cipher suites that ChatSecure does not support?

ejabberd configuration file ### ###

The parameters used in this configuration file are explained in more detail
in the ejabberd Installation and Operation Guide.
Please consult the Guide in case of doubts, it is included with
your copy of ejabberd, and is also available online at
http://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/docs/

The configuration file is written in YAML.
Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML for the brief description.
However, ejabberd treats different literals as different types: ###
- unquoted or single-quoted strings. They are called ""atoms"".
Example: dog, 'Jupiter', '3.14159', YELLOW ###
- numeric literals. Example: 3, -45.0, .0 ###
- quoted or folded strings.
Examples of quoted string: ""Lizzard"", ""orange"".
Example of folded string:
> Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

LOGGING
```
## 

```
loglevel: Verbosity of log files generated by ejabberd.
0: No ejabberd log at all (not recommended)
1: Critical
2: Error
3: Warning
4: Info
5: Debug ##
loglevel: 4
```
## 

```
rotation: Disable ejabberd's internal log rotation, as the Debian package
uses logrotate(8).
log_rotate_size: 0
log_rotate_date: """"
```
## 

```
overload protection: If you want to limit the number of messages per second
allowed from error_logger, which is a good idea if you want to avoid a flood
of messages when system is overloaded, you can set a limit.
100 is ejabberd's default.
log_rate_limit: 100
```
##

watchdog_admins: Only useful for developers: if an ejabberd process
consumes a lot of memory, send live notifications to these XMPP
accounts. ##
watchdog_admins:

================
SERVED HOSTNAMES
```
## 

```
hosts: Domains served by ejabberd.
You can define one or several, for example:

hosts:
- ""myhost.com""
```
## 

```
route_subdomains: Delegate subdomains to other XMPP servers.

However, I expected my previous accept all option to apply here, i.e., that I accept all files from this contact (potentially for this session, but I'd prefer permanently. Configurable is better).

This is a problem as contacts may send files whenever the receiving party is not available to see them. The transfer will then time out. By allowing auto-acceptance, the file can be transferred without user intervention.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,Feature Request: Auto-build Internal Contacts List (hashed) from Existing Contact List,[],"So just like Telegram, WhatsApp, Viber, etc auto build an internal contacts list from my existing contacts but make the contactID a hash of the mobile number(SIM). This way the network doesn't see my actual contact's mobile numbers(SIM). So if all my friends do the same our hashes should align and I know who is who, even though the network has no actual mobile numbers(SIM). Also I will need to enter my own mobile number(SIM) and have it hashed to create the unique contactID for my account. Of course the hash is never displayed since my contacts actual name can be retrieved by reversing the hash and then looking up their name by matching the mobile number from my existing contact list.

In this case there could be no sms verification of the mobile numbers(SIM) so anyone could spoof being someone else. To handle this each contact should default to Unverified status. Once the contact has proven to me that they are who I thought they were, then I can mark the contact as Verified.

A user can just add `chat.facebook.com` along with their username already, but I think it would be a good idea to simplify the process a little. Adding a template similar to the Google one would likely improve usability for non-technical users.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,A couple UI issues,[],"I'm using 14.2.0 from the Guardian Project's Fdroid repository.

1) As I just mentioned in a closed bug report, the initial setting of the global password is a bit confusing, at least with my color scheme (CyanogenMod 12 default, which I imagine is a pretty sizeable part of your user base). It wasn't obvious to me that the starting dialog _is_ the password entry form. I took it to mean that you press ""Set Password"" to see the password entry dialog, and ""Skip"" to skip it. I think part of the issue is that there is paragraph-sized font for the prompting text, and the entry field's color is too close to the dialog background color. To fix it, I think you would want a large font header for the dialog box that says what I'm prompted to do, such as ""Set Master Password"". You can keep the paragraph text. And then the button should say ""Submit"". I think that would make it rather unambiguous what the button does. However, someone with UI experience could give a better analysis.

2) I want to view my fingerprint, so that I can send it to my friend over an established safe channel. I try ""Display Your Fingerprint"", but it requires a QR scanner. My reaction: ""It seems silly to need a barcode scanner for my fingerprint, can't you just display the text?"". Then I tried ""Verify Contact"", and of course that's what I was looking for. Takeaway: the entries should probably be relabeled. Perhaps something like ""Display Fingerprint QR Code"" and ""Manually Verify Contact"".

3) On the manual ""Verify Fingeprint? dialog box, the ""Verify"" button is labeled as ""Manual"". Perhaps there's a reason for your choice of word, but I would call it ""Verify"" or ""Confirm User"" or something. And, I would imagine ""Question"" is a bit ambiguous to users unfamiliar with the OTR process.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,Feature request: export/import (backup/restore) of conversations/threads,[],"AFAIK, the only current mechanism for doing this is to long press on each message, thereby copying it to the clipboard, and then to paste it into another app. That is not user-friendly, if the user wishes to export a whole conversation - or even several conversations.

Perhaps it is also possible via debug logging or similar, but the same applies: not hugely user-friendly.

I am aware that there may be a view that _all_ ChatSecure conversations are intended to be ephemeral and that export/import functionality is inappropriate. I don't share this view, however, and would point out that as ChatSecure already uses persistent storage and already allows export by copying (see above) and import by pasting. Therefore, adding a robust, user-friendly import/export feature would merely formalise and add convenience to existing functionality, and make ChatSecure into an even better app than it already is! :-)

N.B. It might be nice if the import/export feature could integrate with [OpenKeychain](https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain) or similar, so that the backups are encrypted. Also, it _may_ make sense to somehow use [XEP-0313: Message Archive Management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) or [XEP-0136: Message Archiving](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html). These implementation details are just suggestions, however, and not an integral part of my feature request.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,“Your keystore is corrupted”,[],"Hi,

Out of the blue, I tot this message this morning following a ChatSecure crash:

> Your keystore is corrupted.
> Please re-install ChatSecure or 'clear all data' for the app

Trying to enter any current conversation crashes ChatSecure.
Trying to a new conversation crashes ChatSecure.

This is pretty bad, especially considering that, as a user, I don't feel I've “done anything” to deserve this, if you know what I mean :)

Re-installing or clearing ChatSecure's data means I'll lose any information stored in the local history, including pictures which may only exist in this history (as they haven't been exported to the external (insecure by default) SD card).

I'm in a situation where I can afford to lose that data, but others may not be, and on the field, this could prove to be a very nasty bug for certain people.

I'm happy to provide logs to help solve this.

Cheers,

-- Alice never sees Bob available
-- They can speak and make an encrypted session

Regarding this problem I have some suggestions in mind:
1. add an additional **""Restart encryption"" option** that does both stopping and starting encryption
2. add a configurable **OTR session timeout** to automatically stop or restart an encrypted session after no message has been sent or received for a while
3. add a configurable **detection of network changes** (mobile, Wifi, roaming) as a trigger to restart OTR sessions
4. add a configurable detector of the **same account going offline on another device**, to restart encrypted sessions in ChatSecure, making it possible e.g. to continue a PC conversation on the phone, when shutting down the PC

Which suggestions do you think would have a chance to solve the problem?
Which ones are doable?

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,ChatSecure cannot create a group chat room on openfire server.,[],"I Using ChatSecure Android Version with OpenFire Server.
If ChatSecure create group chat room, group chat room seems created on openfire server(3.9.1, 3.9.3 version) 
but anyone cannot join group chat room using any XMPP Messenger( even ChatSecure).

If Spark( for PC Application ) create group chat room, Group chat room created normally. ( same openfire server )
ChatSecure can join that room.

I think the problem occurs because the group room property is not specified. ( muc.create(String) No response from server error ).

Which server should I use? or When you will fix this issue?

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,I have a few bugs,[],"This could be a potential security issue

I am using the secret identity setting on the account. So naturally I checked to make sure that I was using Orbot.

Here are the issues:

-After leaving the app alone for several hours, the encryption of messages stops working periodically. I know this due to an encryption error message that I receive after I receive a supposed encrypted message. sometimes corrected by stopping encryption and restarting encryption on both sides.

-Cannot create a group chat on any server, and it would be useful to be able to add contacts through it using a multi-select feature on the contact list.

-Connectivity issues. after people are added onto the contacts list, they can show up as offline, more often than not. everyone that is involved has to restart their device, or force stop the app and start over again.

Again, all of this was only tested on my end as a secret identity. As of now, I have not been able to test the functions of the other account types.

Expected behaviour: ChatSecure goes offline and than it will reconnect after some seconds (I would be glad if it reconnect after some minutes).

Possible reason: When ChatSecure ""Sign in"" and I want to exit ChatSecure than it shows a message ""Sign out"" forever, than I have to exit the app through holding back button. If ChatSecure can terminate itself and I relaunch the app than ChatSecure is signing in forever too. Only killing the ChatSecure process will ChatSecure return to normal. The last days I deavtivated the foreground priority and now ChatSecure can at least exit and than reconnect after a relaunch of the app.

Some more information: I have played a little with my accounts and now I have seen that only the account which has a seperate connection server set is more affected then the other accounts.
If I have acctivated some more accounts than all are reconnecting well.

EDIT: Now I tested some more settings. When I activate the foreground priority it will mess up the sign in process somehow, but with deactivated foreground priority the accounts are working 9 of 10 times like expected.

I am using pidgin 4.0.0, they are using chatsecure 14.0.3

TL;DR: I was unable to start an OTR session with them until they manually shut down theirs. I could not read _most_ messages they sent me, but could read some. Their messages that I could read, showed up without a lock on their side; their messages that I couldn't read, showed up with a lock.

**All of my unencrypted messages showed as _encrypted_ on their side.**

ChatSecure needs to support multiple keys per contact, that can be validated separately. New keys should be warned about, the first time they are seen. My contact didn't see any of this for my 2nd device.

2. Creating the MUC works, even though i get the message ""Group Chat: Please enable your account to join a gruop chat"".
3. Messages are sent in to the room, but i can't see those i sent myself +  those from other members in that room.
4. There is a 'send file' button, which obviously does not work, so, it might be  a good idea to remove/hide it until this is possible?
5. If i quite CS and restart it, the MUC is gone and i have to add it again (well, see 1. to  3. ;) )

(6. I don't know wether you are aware of Conversation a quite new Android XMPP Client, or not; ( https://github.com/siacs/Conversations ) there's a MUC with oenPGP integration, perhaps it might be worth having a look? )

To confirm that an image or video posted was not tampered with you could rely on another app Hash Droid to generate a SHA512 checksum and have this information along with the timestamp notarized in the blockchain using the former.

Check it out. It would be great if InformaCam can integrate this and if the SatoshiProof app author decides to collaborate with you guys.

They're sending (funny) pictures to each other, but not encrypted - okay, it's really not necessary.

So it would be good if it could be possible to send (at least) images unencrypted. 

Or that it is possible if both sides aren't using encryption.

Additionally, I would be so happy to see ""auto accept filetransfer"" (at least for images). Now, the ""accept files always"" is only for one session. Maybe an additional ""checkbox"" with ""Accept always files from this user"" would be an alternative? 

So it would be accepted if you activate that checkbook.

I nearly never get images because of forced encryption and because I don't realize incoming files.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,"First time user, reporting issues","[Label(name=""BUG"")]","Just tried an encrypted chat for the first time, noticed several issues. I hope these warrant working on, because I'd like to recommend/advocate this app with friends :) (But with the poor performance, I can't really..) I was using Android 4.2.2., the other party an iPhone, and the chat was held over Facebook.

Firstly, I appear to have successfully sent several images, but my partner never/still hasn't received them. Sending images also appears to delay the receipt of any incoming messages until after that image has been sent and is then displayed in the message area. (Would it be possible to implement some sort of progress bar?)

From sending images onwards, received messages would appear in my Android's notification area, and then below the user's name in the contact list but there would be a significant delay before the message would then appear in the contact window, making conversation kinda more difficult (I had to keep checking the contact list to keep up with what my partner was saying. They would eventually appear in the conversation window but waiting for these would make the conversation incredibly slow.)

Finally, the delay between messages being sent and received was at least a minute in some cases - is this normal?  One party would send an additional message or two to the other without having seen messages sent to them minutes prior. Granted, I figure this could be a connection quality issue on one side.

Oh.. btw, I believe when I installed the app on Android I was given the option of applying a password to the app - surely the most obvious of features. But when my friend installed it on their iPhone, there was and appears to be no option for password-protection. Is that an option and they're just not seeing it?

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,"First OTR setup works, then randomly ChatSecure forgets settings.","[Label(name=""BUG"")]","I set up ChatSecure on my smartphone (Nexus 4, CM11), everything okay. Then I add one user into my list and start OTR. I veryfied the fingerprint and on the other side it's the same.

Now I communicate with my contact, everything is encrypted, file transfer works, I close the conversation, I open it again and OTR runs, everything encrypted.

But later, maybe 30, 60, 120 minutes, I open ChatSecure and want to write and realize that OTR is not active. I tried to start it, but the circle, next to the lock, is just circling around and nothing happens. 5, 10 tries later, the same.

Then, maybe 1-3 hours later, I forgot about this and then I see that OTR is active again and everything is fine.

The problem is, that it isn't always working, but if it is, then it's working like a charm.

Btw.: I'm using my own xmpp server (OpenFire) on a VPS.

--- Edit:

No I have tried the following, after I wasn't able to activate OTR session:

Smartphone A -> reboot
Smartphone B -> reboot

Smartphone A starts OTR --> Fingerprint verification nedded (again!)
Smartphone B starts OTR --> Fingerprint verification nedded (again!)

OTR works again, both devices have ""green"" OTR activated.

I guess, if every contact (person) would restart its smartphone, it should work. But I cant ask everybody to do this. I will use my two devices and see when OTR won't work anymore. When this happens, I'll restart both. After 3,4,5 or 10 time, if that works, it could be (maybe) a routine that is startet only at first loading of ChatSecure. (?)

---Edit:

Some minutes, after I have rebooted my device, I tried to start OTR at a person that has OTR desabled, didn't work. But then my contact, where OTR activation was succesful, didn't work, too!
Reboot: Everything fine.

My guess: I you try to activate OTR at somebody, that doesn't use OTR, nothing will work. (only the reboot) Until you only activate OTR, where you are 100% sure, that this contact uses OTR, it will work. Not 100% sure, but I'll keep on trying.

---Edit:

Now it is officially. All the day it was not possible to write to a collegue ""encrypted"" and then later, he was offline. Then I sent him an email and asked if ChatSecure is running. He said that his battery died. He recharged it and booted it. At this moment, when he was online again and I wanted to write him, the OTR session was active again!

--> If OTR is not working, then a reboot helps! So, what is happening at the start of ChatSecure? This should be repeated or put into the OTR routine.

I'm no developer, I'm trying just to tell what happened in simple words :-)

I am a big fan of chat secure, and recently I am writing a static code analysis tool to conduct performance analysis for Android apps. I found several violations of ""resource leakage"" patterns in chat secure's code. These violations could affect the performance of your app. Here is a representative one.

In info.guardianproject.otr.app.im.app.ChatView$DataAdapter$1, the method handleMessage() invokes ""new MediaPlayer();"" to create MediaPlayer. However, according to the suggestion of android developer, when done with the MediaPlayer, it is a good practice to call release(), to free the resources. If not released, too many MediaPlayer instances may result in an exception. Unfortunately, this principle is not correctly applied in this method.

So I am curious :) Looking forward to your response. Thanks.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,Asynchronous communication using OTR,"[Label(name=""FEATURE"")]","**Problem**
Since a while, I'm testing XMPP+OTR for mobile messaging together with a friend of mine. Due to Snowden's revelations we want to use OTR in any case, to secure our communication. However, OTR is only possible when both endpoints are online at the same time, which is a big issue for us (often, one of us is temporarily offline). In practice, we switched back to SMS, because XMPP+OTR often don't work.
**Proposed Solution**
To circumvent the problem, I propose the following behavior: the sending ChatSecure instance could store the message locally until the receiver becomes online. Then, the message could be sent using OTR. That would mean that messages are sent as soon as both parties are online at the same time. A really asynchronous would not be possible, though, because there is no central party storing the message on behalf of the sender, but it might still improve the user experience.

Is it normal that this happens often? It's really disturbing that ORT with it's de-cryption fails and I can't read the messages from my friends. I selected im my settings ""Chat encryption 'automatic' ""

I'm enjoying ChatSecure on Android but I'm really missing one feature. Is it possible to implement BOSH Support for ChatSecure? Behind many company firewalls there is no way to connect to the default xmpp port, so it would be great to add an optional BOSH Server which runs on Port 80/443.

I'm a Ph.D. student and I'm doing research on checking data race for Android apps. I found there are data races that may lead to potential bugs in NewChatActivity.java:

The AsyncTask in ""startGroupChat"" method writes to field ""mRequestedChatId"" at line 2173. This task is eventually be called by ""onLoadFinished"" method at line 300 through method ""resolveIntent"". However, ""onLoadFinished"" also uses ""mRequestedChatId"" at lines 301-303. This lead to data race on ""mRequestedChatId"". Do you think this race may lead to potential bugs? Do you need synchronization on ""mRequestedChatId""? 

""mRequestedChatId"" is also written by ""startChat"" method at line 1944 and 1950, this can also be a race with the written at line 2173.

Also, the AsyncTask invokes ""showChat"" method and ""showChat"" access the GUI elements ""mChatPagerAdapter"" and ""mChatPager"" at line 690 and 700. Android documents say we shouldn't access GUI outside main thread. So this should be a problem. It also leads to a race on these GUI widgets and the Cursor at line 690, since ""mChatPagerAdapter"", ""mChatPager"" and the Cursor is also read/written by main thread.
A fix could be put the statements at 690 and 700 into a Handler or runOnUiThread method.

Thanks,
Yu

My suggestion is to put the status message just right of the contact name, perhaps either a bit more grey, or a bit smaller, so one can easily distinguish between them. If needed, just cut the status message on the right edge.

Additionally, while the font looks gorgeous, it would be great to have the option to choose a smaller font or change font sizes. On modern HD displays even smaller fonts are easily readable.

Method 1: All contacts on screen as if they would be from just one account. Maybe you might auto-assign colors to every account and then tag the contacts then with this color in the contact list.

Method 2: Make a foldable group for every account.

With ChatSecure (Gibberbot did the same thing previously), ALL new messages go to my phone ONLY, no message shows up in Pidgin. This is an issue when I'm sitting at my desk, because I usually have to ask my friend to re-send the message or link so that I get it on my desktop. 

I'm bringing this up to the ChatSecure devs becaue this is the only Jabber app that I run into this issue with -- Xabber properly splits the messages between all logged-in locations (desktop, phone, and tablet), yet ChatSecure does not.

I run my own basic prosody server, and I can see in the mysql database that they are indeed subscribed to each other (both), so the add contact function seems to have worked. Here's what I see in the roster in the DB:   {""subscription"":""both"",""name"":""1"",""groups"":{""Buddies"":true}}

GPG-Encryption would allow Alice to initiate a Chat, even if Bob is currently offline. Once the Bob is online he could receive Alice' message, even though Alice might be offline at that time.
So - overall GPG might not feature as many security features as OTR, it still provides message secrecy and authentication. PLUS GPG is more robust in a mobile environment.

So my request is: Please incorporate GPG-Encryption into Gibberbot!
I guess as Bob might have more than one key (depending on the XMPP ressource he is going to use) Alice should encrypt her message with all of Bobs keys, resulting in a slighty larger message.

I tried to change the srv lookup setting in gibberbot, that did not help.
The server certificate is signed by CACert.

The latter allows priority specification. GB does not.

Most clients will switch to communicating to the resouce with the highest priority. If xabber was set to zero priority and both xabber and gibberbot set the same resouce the implication is that the second login instance of the JID should have preference.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,closed,gibberbot/otr4j needs to read/write remote key fingerprints from the file store ,[],"gibberbot/otr4j stores the whole public key of remote contacts and uses that for verifying whether a contact's key has been seen before and whether its verified.  libotr-based apps like Pidgin and Adium only store the fingerprint of the remote public key.  So that means its currently not possible to convert a libotr otr.fingerprints file to a file that otr4j can use since you cannot generate the public key when you only have the fingerprint.

Therefore, gibberbot/otr4j should store both the fingerprint and the public key for each known contact, and it should also read both the fingerprint and the public key from the file.  If the fingerprint or public key does not exist in the file, gibberbot/otr4j should be able to operate with only one piece of info.  Having the fingerprint alone is enough to know whether a given contact has been seen before and whether it has been manually or SMP verified.

Even though libotr does not store the remote public keys, having those public keys stored could be useful for future features like signing OTR keys with OpenPGP.

There are example key files for many apps here:

It might be possible to get away with gibberbot/otr4j only reading fingerprints from the file, and then whenever it can, converting the stored fingerprints to public keys.

However, I just thought of an idea, and tried it, and I was able to take a screenshot. This could be a security issue ?

I run cyanogenmod 7.1.0 stable

What I did was, select screenshot from the power menu (there is like a 5s timer before it actually takes a screenshot). In that time, I rotated the orientation and i was able to take a screenshot of the conversation. Im not sure if people know about this trick, and i dont want to advertise this trick either for security reasons.

I thought I'd let you know that it is possible to take a screenshot. I hope it gets corrected (but it could be just the way android handles screen orientations).

guardianproject/Gibberbot,closed,Problem while connecting to the specific server,[],"i'm currently using ssh-tunnel app to remap remote port to the local one, this is made to increase security. SO! once i map remote port to the local 5222, and choosing gibberbot to connect to the localhost or 127.0.0.1 server (with private jabber account and domain), it timed out or won't connect at all! And when i'm trying to connect to existing public jabber account like bla@jabbim.com and server to connect is selected 'localhost'  in the settings - it connects successfuly! so i think that server choosing.

My current working scheme: JTalk -> localhost:5222 <== SSH-Tunnel ==> remoteip.com:5222  -> user@remotedomain.com
But Gibberbot is preffer to connect to the public server to auth instead of custom (localhost in my way)

guardianproject/Gibberbot,closed,Vibrate/Alert on Connect annoying when signal comes and goes,"[Label(name=""FEATURE""), Label(name=""SHOULD"")]","An observation from immersing myself in Gibberbot for several days. My antenna on my phone isn't that great, and my phone often loses and regains connection.  GB successfully reconnects all the time - but everytime it does, my phone vibrates and I get a status notification.  (If I had it off silent, it would probably make noise.)  This is exceedingly annoying because everytime it happens I have to pull out my phone and see if it was a reconnect or a message received.

I know the opposite of 'Good User Interface' is 'More Options!' but it'd be really cool if I could get rid of notifications upon connection - either as an option or as a default.
"
guardianproject/Gibberbot,open,"Starting encrypted session should time out; send start, end, and failure IMs","[Label(name=""FEATURE""), Label(name=""SHOULD"")]","Starting an encrypted chat session should have a user-configurable and visible countdown and timeout, and it should also have separate options for user-configurable start, end, and abort messages.  Right now, if the client on the other end doesn't support OTR, they will see a cryptic ??OTRv2?? message and Gibberbot sits trying to open the connection continuously until the user cancels it.

This will help recipients using clients that don't support OTRv2 to understand what's going on when they get cryptic ??OTRv2?? messages in the chat window (e.g. Google Talk), and will help the Gibberbot user know the client machine just hasn't responded in a reasonable amount of time and they can continue.  While the countdown is displayed, allow the user to cancel the attempt.  A default countdown of 10 seconds sounds reasonable.

If the start message is enabled, when the user attempts to start an OTR session from Gibberbot, or Gibberbot does it automatically as part of starting a conversation, the start message is sent to the other end.  Of course, this could be a red flag to log readers later that encryption was used.  For example: ""(Attempting to start encrypted chat session for next 10 seconds.)""

This will help jabber client users who don't have OTR available understand what the ??OTRv2?? message that appears is.

If OTR negotiation fails, sending ""(Failed to start encrypted chat session, perhaps your software doesn't support it?)"" would optionally occur.  If successful, post connection a ""(Encrypted session successful.)"" message might be sent.

These messages would each be able to be toggled on or off individually.

Feedback welcome.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,closed,"fix the text of ""allow plain text auth""",[],"[nathan wrote:](https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/issues/68#issuecomment-2159262)

> If you have TLS off, we don't allow plain text auth at all, even if checked.

This is pretty different than the text in the app:

> ""Allow the username and password to be sent as plain text when using an unencrypted transport""
"
guardianproject/Gibberbot,closed,Gibberbot attempts plain text auth even when disabled,[],"Thanks for gibberbot. 

An issue with the latest 9/16 build:
1. start gibberbot for the first time
2. fill in username and password, leaving advanced settings untouched
3. click ""sign in""
4. I get a generic connection error. the logs say ""Server does not support compatible authentication mechanism."" I get this error whenever ""allow plain text auth"" is enabled. This seems like a bug in its own right, because enabling plain text auth should not force plain text auth, but regardless, the point here is that ""allow plain text auth"" was NOT checked when i hit sign in, but now it is attempting plain text auth.
5. hit back button and edit advanced settings.
6. ""allow plain text auth"" has now been mysteriously checked. uncheck it.
7. click ""sign in""
8. success

My conclusion: when setting up a new account, the visible defaults are ignore and ""allow plain text auth"" is enabled. For a chat app with a focus on security, I think this is not advisable (!).

The other advanced setting that is mysteriously altered is the ""connect server"" option. it goes from blank to the domain of the JID. In my case, I can still connect even though the incorrect ""connect server"" value is set, because the SRV record is still used, but ideally ""connect server"" would stay blank (and also override the SRV record if present).

Keep up the good work.

guardianproject/Gibberbot,closed,Offline Contacts,"[Label(name=""BUG"")]","Gibberbot does not show offline contacts. However, it is standard practice for some to appear offline, while actually remaining online. Most XMPP clients support initiating conversations with apparently-offline contacts. Gibberbot should support the option to display offline contacts, and this should be editable on a per-contact basis.

For instance, Alice may always want to see all her contacts, so she sets the 'show offline contacts' option in the settings. Alice's interface shoes online contacts at the top, and offline contacts below them in the list.

Bob, however, only wants to see people with whom he may be able to converse. He knows that Alice rarely appears offline when she's actually online, but that Charlie is almost always available for urgent communication, even when he appears offline. Bob edits his settings for Charlie, checking the 'show in the contact list even when offline' box. Bob's contact list always shows Charlie, whatever his status, but when Alice is offline, she does not appear in Bob's contact list.
