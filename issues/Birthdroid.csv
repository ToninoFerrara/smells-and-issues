rigid/Birthdroid,closed,Import into Android Studio and multiple enhancements,[],"Hi,

this is the pull request you've asked for -- the import of the sources into Android Studio (also buildable on the command line). Moreover, there are various fixes and enhancements I've added in the meantime. If you'd like to only merge the Android Studio import, give me a note, then I'll create a new pull request only for that.

rigid/Birthdroid,closed,Some contacts get shown multiple times,[],"Maybe there's something wrong with my contacts database, but I get some contacts displayed three times. HOwever, other apps which use and show the contact data do not have this problem. Therefore, I've added an easy fix to filter out multiple contact results.

rigid/Birthdroid,closed,Import into Android Studio,[],"Hi,

I'd like to suggest to import this project into Android Studio, as that is the new recommended IDE for building android apps (see links).

https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html
https://developer.android.com/tools/studio/eclipse-transition-guide.html

I've done this already, if you'd like, I can create a pull request to include the necessary changes. You can take a look at the changes here:

https://github.com/toddy15/Birthdroid/tree/import-in-android-studio

The app builds fine with Android Studio/Gradle on my computer.

"
rigid/Birthdroid,closed,Add Action Bar,[],"The current version of Birthdroid depends on a phone with an hardware menu button to change preferences. So it is not possible to access the preferences menu with newer phones.

A solution would be to use an [Action Bar](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html) which could contain a software preferences button.

rigid/Birthdroid,closed,Missing year causes the app to not display any birthdays,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","In my (Google) contact list I have some contacts where the birthday date consists only of day and month (e.g. 16 January) because I don't know the exact birth year.

This causes the app to throw an error (Birthdays.findDateFormat:371) Could not find DateFormat for ""--01-16"". At least Google allows to have the year missing, so I guess it is a valid case. In this situation the year could be substituted with the upcoming year, or more easily Date formats of MM-dd could be allowed.
