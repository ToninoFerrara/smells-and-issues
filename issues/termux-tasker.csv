termux/termux-tasker,open,Any way to output variables?,[],"Only one way communication here?
stdout/err?"
termux/termux-tasker,open,Termux:Task action executed asynchronously (i.e. doesn't make Tasker wait for it to finish),[],"I created a shell script in Termux that has the command ""sleep 10"" inside, and placed this in the ~/.termux/tasker directory. In Tasker, I created a Task with 2 actions. The first one is Termux:Task that executes the shell script. The second is a Flash action that simply pops up a window with an ""Awake"" message.

When I run the task, the second action immediately gets executed, without waiting for the first to finish.

I'm not sure if Termux:Task is meant to execute asynchronously or synchronously, i.e. whether this is a feature or a bug. I saw this [Tasker guide](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/plugins.html) on how to create plugins, and tried to read the source code to find out whether the synchronous settings are there or not. Unfortunately, things went way over my head very quickly, so I decided to open this issue instead. 

I currently have a way around this asynchronous behaviour. In Tasker, I add an action right after the Termux:Task action that will make Tasker wait until a Tasker variable is set, before proceeding to the next action. Then on the Termux script level, I add a line at the end of my script which sets this Tasker variable using the technique I learned from [glow's blog](https://glow.li/technology/2016/4/03/pass-variables-from-termux-to-tasker/). It's a bit kludgy though, and I would rather do things natively in Termux, if I could only make Termux behave synchronously.

For all I know, asynchronicity is what other users want. I myself can imagine scenarios where that could be handy. Perhaps it would be nice to have a way, for example via a termux.properties global setting or a checkbox within the Termux:Task action, where the user can set whether Termux:Task should make Tasker wait for it to finish or not?"

termux/termux-tasker,closed,Scripts launched from Macrodroid,[],"Hi,  
I'm a new user of Termux (and Termux Tasker) and I'd like to copy files from /sdcard to /data/user/0/ using [Macrodroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid).  

Macrodroid tells me that I need to create this directory:

AFAIK `/home` of Termux is `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/` so I tried to create it using `mkdir ~/.termux/tasker`. [Result](https://framapic.org/M5p04mdBvMnj/CrHwrpAvSxGG.png)

first please bare with my low skills I am rather a user than developer.. 

In Tasker I have a task that creates a playlist with few videos from my subs. 

In termux I wrote a small script that downloads that playlist and converts to mp3 with youtube-dl.
(the sh script for reference: https://pastebin.com/Wsqnvx1B , I use the files in the /variables dir as variables from tasker) 


The script works flawlessly launched from within Termux with ""./"" but from Tasker it won't recognize the URL. When launching the script with terminal window I get this result:

Using Tasker variables works, though one has to type them manually in the configuration dialog.
It would be great if this could be part of the official app, since using an own build will interfere with the main apps package signature and thus would require to also build Termux. This way you can't benefit from PlayStore updates to the official main app."

termux/termux-tasker,closed,Make it possible to access Tasker variables from scripts,[],"From https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/5mq7rc/psa_you_can_install_and_automate_things_like_curl/:

> OK, so I'll just go with my own use-case as an example. I'm using Tasker to automatically write metadata to pictures as soon as I've taken them and exited the camera app. I do this by calling a Termux script from my Tasker task that runs perl exiftool [commands] /path/to/file.
In order for this to work, I obviously have to get the image file paths first of all. This is done by having Tasker read the camera folder and checking to see if there are image files that have been created since I last opened the camera app. The paths to these files are then stored in a local Tasker variable—let's say %paths.
Now I would like to pass this variable to the Termux script that I call at the end of my task in order to do something like perl exiftool [commands] $paths. What I have to do instead is write a text file in Tasker with the %paths variable and then have my Termux script read the information in that file to its own variable, which works but is kind of clunky.
I know I could rework my script to get the file paths directly in Termux, but it would be a lot more simple and versatile for a whole bunch of other use cases if it were possible to pass variables directly from Tasker.
