dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Multiball Stuck Board 4,[],"On board 4, (the one with 6 circles surrounding a larger circle,) as multiball is activated, the main ball can block the extra balls from exiting the onramp, causing them to get stuck and disappear. This is major sad times."
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Can't start version 1.5.6 on Nexus 7 (2013 version) with Android 6.0.1,[],"Whenever I try to start version 1.5.6, the app crashes on my tablet.  If you require more information, I can provide that."
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,closed,Free play - Unlimited balls,[],"I really love this game. It's my goto to unwind with its calming wind chime sfx.  Just one thing would make it perfect and that's a Free Play preference for unlimited balls.  Instead of 3 balls (as determined by the table design), the game would keep incremental count of how many balls have been played in the top right.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Flippers stay raised after ball loss and new ball launch,[],"Minor interface bug.  If you lose a ball while your flippers are raised (independent flippers setting), one will remain raised after new ball launched, until tapped again.  The flippers should be reset to down position at launch.

dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Delay in bumpers activation since Marshmallow,[],"I was playing this game up until recently on my Wileyfox Swift on CyanogenMod 12.1 and the bumpers were very reactive.
Since I upgraded to Marshmallow (CM 13.0) there's a slight delay in the bumpers activation which is highly frustrating. I can't aim accurately anymore.
I don't think it is a hardware limitation as all my other apps are still snappy. Also changing the quality setting does not affect the delay at all. 

Maybe it's because of CyanogenMod's experimental builds instability but I wanted to let you know anyway because I feel like it should not be happening.

dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Allow pinch zoom level,[],"Please add the ability to change zoom level with 2-fingered pinch zoom when ball is not in play.  Add option to Preferences to display the current zoom level.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Add option to increase line thickness,[],"When Zoom Playfield is enabled, the game's 1 pixel thin lines can become faded and difficult to see, even on expensive devices, but especially on lower end devices with cheaper displays.  Refresh and ghosting are an issue.

Please add the option to select a line thickness of 1,2,3. (Default 1)

dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Pause when in background,[],"When I receive an SMS, I have a popup opening in the middle of the screen. The issue here is that the game didn't pause. I couldn't control the ball anymore (and I lost).

So, when in background, it should pause automatically.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Change format of the tables,[],"One of the limitations of the game is that we can't edit/add/remove tables from the compilate game.

What I would propose is to change the format of the tables, to allow greater possibilities, and notably, to remove the necessity of the ""Delegate"".
The table could be described in an SVG file, while the mechanics could be in JS, directly in the file.
Another possibility would be to provide a wide range of hook-ups from the sources, to allow almost everything directly from the JSON.

Once it's done, it would be trivial to scan a folder and add every JSON/SVG file in it as a new table in the game.
Also, using an SVG format would allow a greater editability of the tables, seeing there are a lot of tools to edit SVG files.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Vibrate on bumpers,[],"Add an option to vibrate (a tiny bit) on each bump.
That would create a better feeling of the game.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Support for desktop platforms,[],"Hi there,

This looks like a pretty cool project :) Do you have any plans for making a desktop version of Vector Pinball? I'd mostly be interested in a Linux version as there are practically no good pinball games on Linux, but since the game is in java you can probably handle all desktop platforms at once.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Google Play app description,[],"I've written an alternative description of your app if you would like to use it. 
# 

With swift action and accurate physics, this is pinball in its elemental state. Paddles, bumpers, and lights glow in brilliant neon. As the ball hurtles around one of several unique tables, musical sound effects complement a pulsing electronic soundtrack. A number of configuration options are avilable. 

Vector Pinball is a free and open source software project containing no ads. Check out the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball) if you'd like to help coding or designing tables.

"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Feature request: Retain last 'x' high scores,[],"Currently only one high score is retained, but if possible, I would love to have a dedicated high score menu option showing the last 'x' (say 5) high scores.

Even better would be to have a timestamp next to those high scores, so that we are able to know when we last managed to get a good game. This would be a great motivator to break the previous best high score ;)

dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Ball got stuck top left corner,[],"I didn't manage to get a screenshot but somehow the ball got stuck on the ""default"" table up at the top left corner just to the right of the white circle.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,closed,Feature Request: Add a ball counter,[],"It would be great, if a ball counter is added to the UI. Currently, there is no way of knowing which ball number one is currently at (apart from the message at the top of the screen, after a ball is lost).

This becomes even more important during a long run, when one is more likely to forget which ball is being used.

Also, if a ball counter is displayed, the player can play more aggressively, or cautiously, depending on how many balls are left.

Thanks
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,table and ellement addition,[],"Hello. I took vector pinball as an assignment for my semester and I hope I made some work that may be included to the final source code. I made two extra elements HoleElement and MagnetElement and two new tables with their delegates that have the elements included. Hope you like it.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,closed,Game restart happens too quickly,[],"This is just a suggestion, but after extensive playing of vector pinball (1.3.1) I have often encountered this scenario:

The last ball goes down at speed.  I'm desperately hitting the screen, trying to smack it back up.  I miss and the ball goes out of play, ending the game suddenly.  One of my presses occurs _after_ the sudden end of game. This press actually starts a new game.

As a result of this scenario, the player will be unable to find out what his previous final score is (unless it was a hiscore). He/she may also be unaware that it _is_ a new game that has started (it's wasn't that obvious when I first started playing, although I can tell now).

Perhaps a solution to this scenario is that, as the game ends, ""game over"" is displayed for a whole second, during which time presses are ignored.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,open,Lost hiscore!,[],"It was an amazing score!  Over 7,000,000 (with a 24x multiplier)!

Seriously, though:  After playing the first table, I had a new hiscore.  After game over, on the menu screen, I pressed ""back"" to return to the home screen, assuming this would ensure that my hiscore was saved.  When I relaunched vector pinball, it still showed my previous hiscore (~2,000,000).  It was a sad moment.

Version 1.3.1

I haven't looked at the code, but are hiscores saved on game over?  This would seem to be the best solution to ensure they aren't lost.
"
dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,closed,Sound randomly disappears (on Impression I10).,[],"Impression I10 has [many issues](http://mkaysi.github.com/articles/complaining/ImpressionI10.html), but I don't think that this is one of them.

When playing, sometimes the sounds disappear and I only hear background music. 

I'll send alogcat report soon, but I am not sure does it contain anything useful, because I played until the balls ended (and made new highscrore 187800 on table 2).

dozingcat/Vector-Pinball,closed,disable sound when phone is on silent mode,[],"When the phone ringer is off, I think it makes sense to disable the in-game sound so people aren't surprised.
