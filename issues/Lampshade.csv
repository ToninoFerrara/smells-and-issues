prismsw/Lampshade,closed,No title displayed on any article; Possibly same issue as #9,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","android 5.0.1 - could this be the issue? I am waiting for a 5.1 push to my device, but i am not adverse to rolling back to a prior android release to check this issue out if need be.

Let me know, thanks!

prismsw/Lampshade,open,Current version Does not show navigation at bottom of articles,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Previous versions would have navigation at the bottom of the articles just like the regular site: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny for instance:
 Second Law of Metafictional Thermodynamics | Laws and Formulas | Sensible Heroes, Skimpy Villains 

I'm hoping this is just a simple fix for you, kind human. All of your work is much appreciated!

prismsw/Lampshade,open,"A ""Find in page"" option",[],"A feature that allows us to search for text within an opened page would be useful in the app. That would allow us for eg. to search for a particular show's name when a page contains too many examples to do that manually. The search button seems to be currently unused, maybe this functionality could be attached to it (though I guess many newer phones don't include that button? Not sure on that.)
"
prismsw/Lampshade,open,Non-ascii characters displayed as <?> ,[],"For eg. in the article http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf, the initial poem has lots of <?> characters for me in place of the actual non-ascii characters (æ, þ, etc.)

I don't know if this is device-dependent (I only have access to my own ancient Nexus One running 2.3.7), but the page does display properly in the stock Browser, with the proper Unicode characters in place.

prismsw/Lampshade,closed,"""Saved"" list not updated on pressing Back button",[],"If I go to the ""Saved"" list, open an article (say GoodIsNotDumb), and add a link from there (say BewareTheNiceOnes) to the Saved list, the new link BewareTheNiceOnes doesn't appear when I press the Back button after reading GoodIsNotDumb. 

It does appear if I go back to the app frontpage and press the Saved button again though. [This StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5545217/back-button-and-refreshing-previous-activity) appears to be related, hope it helps.

prismsw/Lampshade,open,A complete offline version,[],"On my device, I use Offline Wikipedia a lot. I also made an offline copy of TvTropes content for my PC. Are you interested in adding a complete offline version of TvTropes to your app or packaging it as another app? I can share the content or the repo for getting it.

prismsw/Lampshade,closed,Site loading broken again,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Error: Could not load the page. Do you want to reload it? | Close | Copy url | Reload |

Loads in chrome when you copy url. I noticed tvtropes broke your app before, hopefully they're not doing it on purpose.

prismsw/Lampshade,open,Allow offline saving,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As the opener of the first issue, many thanks for this cool app!

My usage of this was to try and save things to read for when  I don't have an internet connection. So functionality that would allow me to do this would be welcome. It could be implemented as follows:
- save the text of last 100 pages visited offline, and if the page is being accessed when there is no internet connection, show the offline version.
- Allow the user to manually save a page for offline reading, and a new main menu that lists these pages.
- Something else?

If you'd like to go deeper, maybe the option that saves this page, and all subpages :)
