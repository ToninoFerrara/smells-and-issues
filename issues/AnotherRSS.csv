no-go/AnotherRSS,open,suddenly no feeds found on Huawei / Android 7,[],"I use v2.18 on Hawei P9 lite, Android 7.0 since September 2018 and it worked fine. 

Some days ago no RSS feeds are found anymore. I don't remember changing the configuration. 

The app didn't asks for permission so none are granted. The feeds list is still filled, some entries are selected and at the end some empty lines are listed.

Am I the only one affected?"

Started it, waited for some time but the indicator just keeps on spinning and no feeds in the list would load. App's traffic log on the phone shows no traffic at all (mobile and wifi) and the app doesn't ask for any permissions either, which it should do on Android 6(+), at least for storage (I suppose). Using a (Huawei) Honor 6, Android 6. Help is appreciated! ðŸ˜ƒ"
