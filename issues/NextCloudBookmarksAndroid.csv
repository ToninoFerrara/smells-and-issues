TTTDevs/NextCloudBookmarksAndroid,open,Stopped working recently - fails to save bookmark,[],"Hi - pretty sure this was working until recently. Tried to use it today, and it is no longer working. 

When I go to Share -> Save to Nextcloud, I get the login screen, and then the add bookmark screen. I fill it in and then hit 'Save', and the page appears to reload. But the bookmark does not get saved. The app loads the list of existing tags, so I assume it is logged in correctly.

If I click on the icon at the top of the page, I get a list of bookmarks. I can add bookmark from this page.

Only thing I can think of is I added two factor authentication to the server - and I think I have made logins for all the apps and so forth. Pretty sure I have used Bookmarks since then. 

I am running Nextcloud 13.0.6, apps are up to date. Android is version 5.1.1

TTTDevs/NextCloudBookmarksAndroid,open,Update README.md,[],"Hi,

This small and useless PR adds two buttons to get your app on F-Droid and Google Play Store in the README.md.

Thanks for this app :)"
TTTDevs/NextCloudBookmarksAndroid,open,Hangs on splash screen from first run,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","When I try to share bookmarks to Nextcloud, I only get to the screen saying ""Connecting to NextCloud. Please wait."" Nothing more happens, not even a blank screen like in issue #2.

* NextCloud URL is correctly filled in
* Bookmarks active on server instance
* Nothing registers on server side, either."
TTTDevs/NextCloudBookmarksAndroid,open,Session expires after X amount of time/hours/days,"[Label(name=""help wanted"")]","I'm not sure if this is something that can be fixed... 
Maybe expiration time is defined by the server and just preserving the cookies inside the app might not be enough. If that is the case, users would need to re-login each time time the session expires ðŸ˜¢ "
TTTDevs/NextCloudBookmarksAndroid,open,"White screen after ""Sharing""","[Label(name=""bug"")]","After setting up my server URL, I tried to share a bookmark to the app. 
At first a screen opens and shows ""Contacting Nextcloud, [...]"".
Then the next screen opens, but this one is only white. I waited quite bit, but nothing happens there.

Other Nextcloud android apps work fine."
