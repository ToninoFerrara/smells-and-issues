franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,open,Option for restaring SystemUI,[],"I love the 'restart SystemUI' option some ROMs offer, especialy when applying substratum themes. Could you add an option for this?"
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,closed,French Translations,[],
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,open,Source code for 8.0,[],"I use Simple Reboot from F-Droid (7.0.1) and noticed the Play store had a new release (8.0), but I don't see any commit activity in this repository. Has development moved somewhere else?

(It would be incredibly helpful if releases were tagged as well, since F-Droid can automatically pick those up to trigger builds of new releases, and also for the historical purposes of going back to reconstruct a old version as it was released.)"
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,open,Confirm action execution,[],"I would like to ask if it is possible to add a confirmation message (after choosing the option you want) to avoid any mistakes or unwanted restarts, please"
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,closed,Schedule reboot,[],"Like, once you choose what-ever one of the options, you are asked whether you want this action to be executed now, or at some hour. "
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,open,French translation + README.md,[],"Hi,

This small PR adds the French translation and two buttons in the README.md to get your app.

You can ping me in the future if you have anything new to translate ;)

Thanks for this app :)"
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,open,Descriptions,[],"Would you be able to re-put the descriptions? 

Especially for first-time users.."

franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,closed,Update to 7.0.1,[],"Playstore has been updated to 7.0.1, could you push those changes as well?"
franciscofranco/Simple-Reboot-app,open,Don't use timebased versioncodes,[],"Timebased versioncodes, at least autogenerated once, break reproducible builds. I would expect that checking out a git commit hash would always give me the same version. Instead, I now get a newer version which every build. Imaging you want to build the current version and an older release. Depending on when you build which, an older version might be proposed as update, since it has a newer timestamp.

If you really want timebased vercodes, maybe get the time from the git commit instead?"
