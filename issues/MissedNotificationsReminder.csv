Firstly - have been using your very useful app for some time on an older phone and it's worked great - thank you for your work (I would be happy to donate if there is a link available?)

I've recently got a new android 7.1.1 phone (and notice a couple issues - it's impossible to know if this issue is because of the new phone, or because of an updated app ?

Using v18 Debug.  Phone is in Priority Only mode.  I've given Override to app.

Settings:
- Notification is enabled
- Access to storage given

1) unable to add a custom notification sound (clicking on Show Advanced > Sound > Add notification - does nothing.  How can I a custom sound?  I have custom ringtones on the phone, but can't seem to access them from the app.

2) Battery Optimization - I go ahead and do this and I have to go to Battery Optimization > All apps > Scroll to Missed Notification Reminder > ""Don't Optimize"" > Done.  However, when the phone reboots, it reverts back to ""not optimized""

3) When phone screen is off Notification doesn't work

Thanks for any help?

httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,Problema di funzionamento,[],"Scrivo in italiano sperando che possiate tradurre quello che scrivo.
Ho due telefoni, un doogee con andriod 7 ed un xiaomi con sistema basato su android 7.

Appena installo la app funziona, tutto ok.
Se modifico qualunque impostazione del ""advanced setting"" la app non funziona più.

Se imposto le scheduler non funziona, se tolgo la extra-notification non funziona, se metto la vibrazione non funziona.

Se riporto le impostazioni allo stato iniziale continua a non funzionare.

Per me è indispensabile questa app, spero potete risolvere il problema"

httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,Consider re-posted notifications as new ones,[],"This allows to ignore a message from an IM app, but still be

clean-up list of deleted ignored notifications, which caused already
ignored notifications to stop being ignored after another notification
is posted."
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,ICS version triggers TTS Engine,[],"Hi, Just to let you know that the new ICS version 1.1.15 somehow triggers the Google Text-to-speech Engine (com.google.android.tts) when activated on a Samsung S3 Mini (4.1.2 Stock Rom) so that there is a voice comment even when scrolling through the Samsung stock launcher. Cheers!"
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,Add ability to generate dismiss notifications while reminder is active,[],"I was not able to properly test this on my phone because for some reason when I deploy and try to debug the app, the ReminderNotificationListenerService instance is never created. The other day everything worked as expected, but I've made some refactoring changes and couldn't test them anymore. Do you know what might be causing Dagger not to create an instance of the ReminderNotificationListenerService class?

Also I can't add Japanese and Bulgarian translations for the new strings becase I don't speak these languages. If you'd like me to use Google Translate, please let me know and I'll be happy to add them."
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,Reminders stop when notification bar is opened on Android 8.0,[],"Same happens when sliding a reminder down in the lock screen to reveal action buttons. This happens because app depends on AccessibilityService to detect cancelled notifications. On Android 8.0, while sliding the notifcations bar open, several TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED accessibility events are generated and when the user open bar slowly enough, the root accessibility node does not contain list of notifications since they are not yet visible on the screen. The app then thinks they were all removed and stops reminding the user."

httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,overrides Do not disturb,[],"Hi,
al least on a J320M running 5.1.1, when the phone is in do not disturb mode, notifications will still be reminded, which is not really wanted.
Workaround is to set the custom scheduler so the reminder is off at the time when do not disturb is on, but this requires maintaning to schedules for the same stuff, and gets easily broken if the user manually sets the phone in do not disturb (he/she should also disable the reminder, and remember to enable it back later).
I can help if properly guided.
Regards."
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,[RFE] ability to define progressive delay between notifications,[],"It would be nice to have a possibility to define interval differently according to age of the apps notification. Missed Message Flasher use this feature which is really nice.
Particularly there's possibility to define different intervals for different ages, e.g. 30 seconds for less than 300s age, 300 seconds for less than 900s age, etc. all this is configurable in Missed Message Flasher."
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,[RFE] list apps with ongoing notifications to easily enable/disable them,[],"It would be nice to have possibility to see apps with ongoing notifications instead of scrolling through list fo all apps. It would help a lot in case of disabling specific apps.
Like to ability to handle list of apps with ongoing notifications instead of all apps. Could be implemented as independent list or just listed at the beginning of the apps list similarly to those selected apps."
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,[RFE] possibility to define apps blacklist instead of whitelist,[],It would be nice to be able to notify all apps nitifications except those I explicitly disable. Could be implemented as by checkbox which would change the logic of selected apps list as many of similar apps do.
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,debug means / verbose logcat,[],I suspect that the app false-notifies. Could you please add the verbose logcat so that I see what makes my phone vibrate?
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,get minSdkVersion back to 14,[],"I've CM9/Android 4.0 and got stuck with MissedNotificationsReminder version 1.1.5

Thanks a lot!"
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,Create git tags for every release,[],Please do that. Without tags f-droid refuses to build new versions. Hence F-droid users are stuck with version 1.1.5
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,open,Bind to LED indicator,[],"This app should have the option, in lieu of or in combination with whitelisting other apps, to remind me if and only if the LED has been active for the selected duration. The problem this solves is that some apps issue both useful notifications and permanently-on status messages. For example, to be reminded about a missed call or voicemail, I have to whitelist the phone app; however, this causes a reminder to be issued every few minutes during a call."
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,Off-topic: Suggested reminder Interval options: Minutes/Seconds,[],"The shortest reminder Interval is currently 0.25 minutes (15 seconds). I would like to have it set to 1 second so I can use it as alarm clock with a short notification sound.

Alarm clocks do beep at least every 5 seconds but shorter reminder intervals may be required for some people that easily fall asleep.
"
httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder,closed,Don't vibrate if phone is in Silent Mode. + some suggestion,[],"I made a small patch so the Reminder won't vibrate if the phone is in silent mode. It is attached in the link below.

Using code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2048427/how-can-i-detect-whether-the-android-phone-in-silent-mode-programatically
-   AudioManager manager = (AudioManager) context.getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);
-   return manager.getRingerMode() == AudioManager.RINGER_MODE_SILENT;

The app is great! I hope to see it soon definitely added to the android.

Also I would make a suggestion about customization of the scheduler. My Cyanogenmod android kit-kat already have a programmable scheduler (called Quiet Hours) to set to enter silent mode, vibration only, turn off the notification led, and many other behaviours on programmable times (however not by day-of-the-week). My guess is that such scheduler improvements should not be done in this app... so won't override the android features... I think rarely someone will need a different behaviour for each app/time/day/reminder notif./app notification/vibrate/led/sound....

Thanks!!!

**Vanja Lovretić:** ""as i wrote first time (now i do not see at all that post), two tablets, pipo m8pro, stock 4.4.2, and samsung galaxy tab a t555, stock 5.0.2. both of them are rooted. all necessary requirements are granted, applications are selected and added to ""reminder list"". some of them are k9 mail, viber, telegram, talon for twitter, stock e-mail application. on both tablets, less than 10 apps . you asked about launchers - pipo is on adw launcher, samsung is on stock. notification sounds checked and tryed - working, audible and used by other apps. on my telephone i have ""missed reminder"" app, which is only for calls, sms and mms. and there is everything ok. same adw launcher, root. so, i presume there is something about newer OS version. as i wrote first time, great idea for app, but something is glitchy. fingers crossed that you can make it working!""
