jatwigg/cmus-android-remote,open,Update project's android studio and gradle version,[],"```
    The new version of Android Studio and Gradle does some different
    things when it comes to where it puts build files, their format,
    etc. This commit updates these files so that the project can be
    opened in android studio, and the app built.

    This commit also removes a large number of files that should not
    be tracked, most notably, the app/build/* files/folder.

    * Include .gitignore to omit
            app/build/*
            .idea/<personal settings>
            local.properties
    * Delete .gitignore tracked filed in repo
    * Update app/app.iml
             app/build.gradle
             build.gradle
```

This Pull Request need not be merged into `master`, or at all, but any work that I will do will depend on this new version of Android Studio, Gradle, etc...

jatwigg/cmus-android-remote,open,Refactor Main Shuffle/Repeat/Volume Buttons,[],"[Enhancement]

The current shuffle/repeat/mute buttons rely on `Toast`s to indicate their current value.

These buttons could be refactored to use an image-toggle type of button.
Additionally, a button could be added to switch from `play_library` to `play_playlist` mode.

These options are currently read by the `CmusStatus` class, but nothing is done with them.
- [ ] Update Mute, Shuffle, Repeat, RepeatAll buttons to show current selection
- [ ] Include PlayLibrary toggle button

jatwigg/cmus-android-remote,open,Volumn Step Setting,[],"[Enhancement]

Add a setting for the volume up / down step. Currently, this uses the default `10%`, however that can be a bit much.
- [ ] update `activity_host_manager.xls` to include buttons / selectors
  - \- [ ] update `ActivityHostManager` to input numbers and whatnot
- [ ] update `Settings` to support volume step value
- [ ] update `CmusCommand` to respect volume step setting
