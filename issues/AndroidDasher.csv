acl33/AndroidDasher,open,Crashes when using WhatsApp Emoticons,[],"If you use Dasher on Android with WhatsApp and insert graphical emoticons from the WhatsApp Menu, these are represented and displayed as some unreadable character in Dasher. 

While that's not a problem by itself, it seems to cause Dasher to crash after a few seconds in some situations, especially when hovering over the special character. 

Maybe the error is caused by the fact, that the special ""emoticon-characters"" are not part of any standard alphabet in Dasher, but that's pure speculation.

Using Dasher 2.5 on Android 2.2.2 with 2.8.7326

Thank you!
