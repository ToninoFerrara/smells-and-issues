segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Merge pull request #1 from segler-alex/master,[],Update
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Improve Current Playing Mechanism,[],"Radio Droid now relies on the radio browser servers completely. If the selected server is down, none of the favorite stations users saved to the app can be played, even they are available. The mechanism increases the burden of the servers and causes unnecessary inconvenience to users. All the favorite station data can be saved to the app, like an independent local database, which will not be affected by the maintenance of the servers."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Add Last.fm API to Show Cover,[],"Since the Last.fm API is free to use, it may improve user experience by showing the cover of the playing song with it.

segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Add Prompt After Searching,[],"When users search a non-existent station name, the app doesn’t give any prompt, so they don’t know if they should keep waiting for the result. A prompt like **no result found** is required after a non-existent item is searched."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Add Option to Define Recording Path,[],"At present uses can neither define the recording path, nor delete the recording files, but they both may be required."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Some National Flags Not Shown Properly,[],"When the light theme is enabled, some national flags with white stripes can’t be shown properly, like Czech, Japan, Indonesia, Russia. There should be a boundary between the flag and the white background."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Save to Playlist Not Support Non-Latin Characters Well,[],"The app doesn’t support the file name only containing non-Latin characters, which is recognized as invalid, and the strings are not localized."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Radio Droid Crashes After Favorite Added,[],"When an invalid Radio Droid server is selected or there is no network available with the option **Icon clicks** enabled, go to history, click any icons which are not starred, the app crashes."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Add State List in Country,[],"Currently users can’t browse the stations by state in Radio Droid, which makes the station list in countries lengthy. The function of **show state list in country** is needed and users can choose if that’s enabled or not.

segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Search in tags,[],"The tags list is huge, one can only scroll it up/down; it would be useful if one could search for tags matching a pattern (of course this could be extended to other tabs: countries, languages, etc).

This could be implemented by extending the already existing search bar (restricting its search domain to the current tab), or by adding a dedicated search bar in the tab, whichever is easier to implement.

When I want to play a recorded song, the RadioDroid crashes. It appears to want to start Vanilla Music even when this is not the standard App for playing files.

When navigating manually with the file manager to the recordings folder, playing works.

Can anyone confirm my observation?

However we should not advertise the support for it since all remaining functionality should be implemented before. 

Also I wasn't able to straightforwardly integrate Top(Vote/Click) lists into Android Auto since their retrieval was too messy and needed heavy refactoring.

segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,How to add my favorite radio stations that are not on RadioDroid?,[],Is there any tutorial for this? Thanks
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Add support for podcasts (RSS streams),[],"I added a podcast stream to the radio-browser wiki and discovered your app was unable to play it, even though it played without a hitch on the wiki site.

This could be implemented by checking the stream URL and determining if it represents a RSS XML file. Afterwards, you could parse for all of the URLs, and any other metadata such as titles, create a simple looping playlist.

The RSS state could be cached for the main activity to reconcile pause/play functionality, ensuring the podcast would continue where it left off. This functionality could be extended to the app preferences to allow the user to pause/play the broadcast while the app is still open OR initialize the podcast playlist with the latest (or oldest) broadcast every time the app is first opened."
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,"Feature request: a ""Now Playing""-tab",[],"This request came allready up in #352, but the thread went a little aside. Thats the reason, why I created a new request. In #325 there is mentioned a ""status page"" with similar content?

My reasons for that wish: 
- I want to see the information ""Station"" and ""Title - Artist"" displayed big! and not in font-size 6 elsewhere, as if this were unimportant. And: if I use the app on my headunit of my car, I can read nothing.
- now if I want to stop the player and I tap not precise onto the  pause-icon, I get a new station or another tab or a recording. In a ""Now Plying-window the play/pause-button can be real big and there would be space enaugh for a ""Record""-button.

I tried several radio-streaming-apps, which do not listen to me and don't show ads, this one, Transistor, Servestream, Webradio and some more from Playstore. This best in "" displaying"" is so far ""Simple Radio Player"" from Playstore (but a bit complicated in adding a station).

In those links you can see that the whole problem is fixed on recent Custom ROMs. Trouble is that a lot of devices are stuck on older ROM releases so RadioDroid development should do the necessary steps to avoid it like the developers on the app ""Conversations"" did (look at the last link).

Current issues/questions:

- Does ExoPlayer uses the same HttpDataSource for HLS playback and what does it do when changing tracks?

segler-alex/RadioDroid,closed,[Improvement] Better integration of ExoPlayer to improve experience with unstable connection,[],"At the moment with unstable connection stream is stopped many seconds before buffered content ends. E.g. we have 25s buffered, connection dropped when 15s left and playback is stopped until connection restored, but we had those 15s to play while restoring the connection.

The issue is that local proxy is used to deliver content to ExoPlayer which is suboptimal approach and it is a legacy needed for MediaPlayer. While ExoPlayer itself can play streams with DefaultHttpDataSource it doesn't retrieve shoutcast data. So the solution is to create custom HttpDataSource based on okhttp3 (like currently done in proxy). This way buffers will be copied less times and the solution is much cleaner.

I have made custom HttpDataSource and it works with stable connection.

Current issues:
- I don't see documentation where is specified how to correctly restore failed connection, from code ExoPlayer doesn't handle lost connection so HttpDataSource should handle it. I try to reconnect when any exception on read data from stream occurs and reconnect is itself retried when failed. I haven't tested it yet but there may be an issue with stream discontinuity since I don't see requirements for HttpDataSource if there any to mitigate it (there is a logic in ExoPlayer which mitigates discontinuities but it is not clear how and when it works). 
- Recording of a stream is done before ExoPlayer processes the data but it seems it is possible to capture processed output where discontinuities should probably be fixed and it will work a lot better with hls streams which I will describe in another issue. In https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1167 is mentioned that it's possible to override the method in [MediaCodecAudioRenderer ](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/blob/r2.1.1/library/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/audio/MediaCodecAudioRenderer.java#L312) which processes the output.
- With these changes code that support MediaPlayer and ExoPlayer will diverge so now it should be considered to drop MediaPlayer support.

2) We should have extra info in the player status like session playtime so we can see how long the station been playing for that session. It would be just as useful as the amount of data used during that session.

4) The record button should be smaller than the play/stop buttons to reduce the chances of us hitting it. I imagine more people just want to listen rather than record the audio, so the record button should be secondary and smaller than the playback functions. 

Overall, the player status page will look more like a modern audio player with these improvements, and allow the player status page to be just as functional as the listings, which it should be.

segler-alex/RadioDroid,closed,Refactor PlayerService. Add media button support. Add pause/resume. Other small improvements,[],"This changes a lot in PlayerService. Should fix: #87 #92, but without auto play when device is connected and issue #73.

I added pause and resume of stations playing which is utilized by notification UI and media button.

Now when e.g. bluetooth headset disconnected play will pause which is desired behavior for media player. Also player will reduce volume if any short sound, like notification, will appear.

I had to refactor PlayerService because it was hard maintain it with new changes.
There were several issues:
- Never ended thread with looper which was used for exo player.
- Spawning new threads for small tasks.
- Too many different layers of logic were in PlayerService like controlling two diferrent players, controlling proxy, updating notifications and so on. Which with new logic was incredibly messy.

So I moved player details behind PlayerWrapper interface which is now implemented by ExoPlayerWrapper and MediaPlayerWrapper. To manage proxy and current player I introduced RadioPlayer. I decided to move all operation concerning players into a separate thread which created once. After that PlayerService uses RadioPlayer whithout bothering about players.

Overall I consider this refactoring to be an impromement to the current state but still I'm not fully satisfied with it, because there are still many possibly unnecessary checks and there is still a possibility for player to go into an unforeseen state.

 Please, review and test changes on your device and discuss if something is wrong or unclear.

I noticed early that a few stations works on radio-browser.info but the same stations do not work on RadioDroid. I assume RadioDroid updated an internal database but each time the app is being updated to a new version. There should be two options:
* to manually update the database if your favorite station(s) don't work.
* to periodically update the database, say every day, week, month (the default option is ""On RadioDroid upgrades"").

For example, **psyradio * fm - psytrance**:
* Works with  [Radio Browser](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/byname/psyradio%20*%20fm%20-%20psytrance) stream in VLC.
* Works with the RadioDroid-like app [Internet Radio](https://f-droid.org/packages/community.peers.internetradio/)

Sorry, that I don't know exactly, however, I did not have the weekly alarms before, so I suspect that I was on 0.27 before. And this might occur when doing an update 0.27 --> 0.28 if new alarm settings are introduced there. I had 3 alarms configured before. One of them active.

It was not enough to wipe the application cache to solve it.
However, deleting the complete application data restarting the app did the trick for me. Of course you loose all favorites and configured alarms by this. This might make some users ""nervous"".
(But I think, I am using a great open source tool, somebody does in his spare time, so I can invest 10 min to re-add my favorites and alarms. And maybe another 20 to let you know about this. :wink: )

I do _not_ consider this a ""real bug"" which needs fixing, as this will solve itself as soon as all users are on version 0.28 or newer. Anyway I wanted to let you know. (Maybe you make a comment somewhere about this for the users?)

Curiously enough, I found it possible to prevent the bug in previous versions (0.25, 0.26) by scrolling the list of starred radio stations very slowly, and even then it would sometimes occur.
It happens even if it's the only application launched apart from system services and a messenger app.
I suspect it has to do with RAM usage. 
It had been much worse prior to 0.27, but it's still there.

Is RadioDroid taking the advice of radio-browser.info on what stations are up as truth? In that case, has radio-browser.info gotten IP banned from Soma, and other stations, perhaps?

I would like more informative feedback about what RadioDroid is doing and especially how it fails, for it to try station addresses anyway even if they are marked broken (if it's not already; if it isn't, where should I look next to figure out what's wrong?), and maybe rather than using your single source IP to poll all the stations in your catalogue, have the app do (anonymous!) tracking so tht as people listen they are implicitly voting on the reliability of stations."

This seems to be the common behavior for most apps (Messengers, Phone calls, etc.) and it makes a lot of sense.

Another thing I would suggest is to remove duplicate entries from the 'History' page. It doesn't help you to find the same station multiple times. If that is done a more appropriate name for the 'History' page would be 'Recent'.

segler-alex/RadioDroid,closed,proxy - do not stop on error; increase buffer & timeout,[],"PlayerService: Replay current stream instead of stopping in case of proxy problems

StreamProxy: Increase buffer, read timeout
more detailed logging

About the changes: These are mainly changes that affect the way that radiodroid behaves
when being used with bad (or varying) internet connection.
Currently, radio droid is Playerservice is being stopped if the proxy has for example a streaming error
or bad connection. That means that you have to manually restart the stream each time
this happens. This is very undesirable - you have to pull the smartphone out and act every time.
With this change, instead it tries to restart streaming by itself. No manual intervention needed.
Stopping a stream manually works as usual.

The increased buffer also improves playback quality, however, it is not possible yet to make an even greater buffer with the current implementation because of resulting error in the output stream.

Future ideas: Use buffers from OKhttp - no need to re-implement buffers.
With their help it is easily possible to resume playback at the correct position as they allow
to search within byte stream. Currently with a bad connection several parts may be played 
twice which sounds odd.

It should also be no problem to create a buffer that can hold some minutes of music to 
be able to have continuous playing even in situations of bad connections (e.g. in train or 
during biking).

"
segler-alex/RadioDroid,open,Possible causes of Hang-Bugs Found ,[],"Dear RadioDroid Developers,
I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing RadioDroid with it (master version downloaded today). I tested the app with a Nexus 4 (Android 5.1) and Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1). I found that the main thread of RadioDroid calls:

1) android.graphics.BitmapFactory.decodeStream(BitmapFactory.java:649) and
2) org.json.JSONArray.<init>(JSONArray.java:108)

frequently when opening, refreshing, searching the list of radio stations. In particular, the above APIs are called as consequence of the following calls:

```
1) net.programmierecke.radiodroid2.ItemAdapterStation.getView(ItemAdapterStation.java:134) -> android.graphics.BitmapFactory.decodeStream(BitmapFactory.java:649)

2) net.programmierecke.radiodroid2.DataRadioStation.DecodeJson(DataRadioStation.java:57) -> org.json.JSONArray.<init>(JSONArray.java:108)
```

In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bugs) experienced with RadioDroid.

As the developers guide of Android suggests, moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. It is actually possible to move those two operations off the main thread using background threads. Therefore, do you think that the smoothness of the app would improve by executing those functions off the main thread?

Thanks for any information,
I hope I can help improve RadioDroid.

- UTC timestamp of last change **""upd"":""YYYYMMDDHHMMSS""**
- UTC timestamp of last data validation **""ok"":""YYYYMMDDHHMMSS""**
- md5 : per station entry: md5 (or sha1 or sha256, but md5 is fine here) hash of all data
  **""md5"":""<md5hash>""**
- coding method (MP3, OGG, ...) (if known)
- bitrate indication (CBR, VBR) (128/64/36) and/or value HQ / MQ / LQ (if known)
- use PRETTY_PRINT in PHP json_encode( ..., PRETTY_PRINT) for nicer output
#### new endpoints
- add **new endpoint /modified-after/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS** which results in all records which were modified after the indicated date
- compact output formats for results: instead of presenting the whole record(s), only respond with **md5** hash and **upd** timestamp only
#### implement a server method to link different stream entries for the same radio station/program

Example: MP3-HQ-128, MP3-MQ-64, OGG-VBR-HQ, OGG-VBR-MQ, OGG-VBR-LQ-MONO (example: Deutschlandradio Kultur)
This might require a modification of the JSON/XML output. Or link different entries by a ""handle"" which glues the different stream entries.
#### User interface UX
- add a flag ""report invalid stream url"", which the user can click in the app, and which flags the station data as ""possibly broken""
- give users the hint text how to add several tags (comma-separated)
#### Sanitize all inputs and outputs
- XSS protection
- check and validate inputs, e.g. protocol handler
- normalize tag entries (currently, tags are separated by "","" like ""tag1, tag2, tag3""). There was no information, that commas must be used.

segler-alex/RadioDroid,closed,Works. How can I help to improve it?,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi Alex, I was looking for a simple Radio App for my stations see https://github.com/Wikinaut/MyStreamRecorder/blob/master/rec.ini .

Your code works, but it would be indeed nice to have at least the **search** (of your to-do list) working, with a stream selection, if possible (some stations like DeutschlandRadio offer ""multi-bit rate"" streams, I can supply you with the stream urls).

I also suggest:
- add possibility to enter a stream Url manually (see #171)
<s>- add ""sharing"" tools to share a radio station / stream url (implemented now)</s>
- add a tool to import/export favorite station list per OPML https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML file, similar to what Stefan's https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.shandschuh.sparserss&hl=de does (export a list of one's seletion of RSS feeds in OPML format)
